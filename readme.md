# Sephora Product Reviews Classification
This project uses a subset of the ["Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews) dataset to train a machine learning model capable of classifying Sephora product reviews as either **recommended** (1) or **not recommended** (0) based on the review content.

## Project Description
The project aims to build a machine learning model, specifically a language model, for text classification. The target variable is the `Is_recommended` column, while the review text, contained in the `review_text` column, represents the predictive variable.

### Main Objectives
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a model capable of classifying reviews based on sentiment and other implicit factors indicated in the text.
- **Applications**: Provide a useful tool for quickly analyzing product reviews and supporting marketing decision processes.
