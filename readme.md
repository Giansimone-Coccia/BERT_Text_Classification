# 💄 Sephora Product Reviews Classification

This project uses a subset of the [**Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews) dataset to train a machine learning model that classifies Sephora product reviews as either:

- ✅ **Recommended** (1)  
- ❌ **Not Recommended** (0)

Classification is based on the **review content**.

## 📘 Project Description

The project aims to build a **machine learning model**, specifically a **language model**, for text classification.

- 🏷️ **Target Variable**: `Is_recommended`  
- 📝 **Predictive Feature**: `review_text` (the full content of the review)
