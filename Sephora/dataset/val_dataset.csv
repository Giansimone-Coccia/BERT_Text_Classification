Great clean. Soft scent. Doesn’t burn or dry out my skin.,1.0
"Meh, nothing special. Doesn’t do anything for me. Just another mediocre cream. Would not buy again.",0.0
"this saved my dry skin! my skin was so dry I couldn’t put any makeup on my face! slather this on at night and in the morning my skin will be so moisturized! I would only recommend this for very dry skin because this is straight oil, so oily skin gals beware!",1.0
I have dry skin and this moisturizer is AMAZING. Leaves your skin feeling amazing! 10/10,1.0
I live in a cold dry place so I desperately need chapstick all the time. I started using this lip mask at night and it’s magic. I also use it during the day because it leaves the perfect amount of gloss!,1.0
"I’m a fan of this, 100%. This is a PHA/BHA based product. I love how it has PHA (poly hydroxy acid) which is a gentle form of exfoliant. More gentle than AHA’s. Cause let’s be real not everyone can use an AHA because they tend to be too much for people’s skin. So I love how this product focuses on all skin types even sensitive skin as well! I have very sensitive eczema prone skin. I applied with with my hands after washing my skin. I gently pat it into my skin so that it penetrates better. The consistency is somewhat thick and sticky like but you know it’s a serum as well. The scent is not overpowering, then again I enjoy sweet scents. My skin glows when I use this and it has helped so much with my pores! I’ve had my eye on this before I was given this to review but it looks like now I’ll be purchasing the full size!",1.0
"This essence smells great, isnt drying or over powering. I really like this and definitely reccomend trying!",1.0
"Love gel moisturizers for the eye area. This one worked well for the short time I used it. A little pricey, but definitely nice.",1.0
I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. The concept of this retinol stick is genius! I don’t have too many wrinkles around my eyes yet so I’m using this as a preventative measure. After using this for several weeks I do have to say that my eye area is a lot smoother and my concealer applies more nicely without any patches or flakiness. With retinol products it is not uncommon to experience some purging and I did get two small bumps/pimples (one on brow bone and other under my eye close to cheek area). Luckily these disappeared within a week and it was smooth sailing from there. The only reason why I’m not giving it 5 stars is because I wish it glided on more easily. There is slight tugging of the skin but it isn’t extreme,1.0
"This is such a great moisturizer! It’s rich and luxurious, so it feels like a dream when you put it on just before bed.  I have combination skin and it didn’t have any effect whatsoever on my skin.  I did notice a difference almost immediately upon using it.  My skin looked firmer and more full, with a hint of a glow. I was able to try this for free in exchange for an honest review, and I’m so happy I was able to test it out!   I absolutely love this product, I can’t wait to go buy more!",1.0
This is an amazing product and when used consistently does exactly what it says. I have puffy eyes in the mornings and apply it with my morning skin routine to give me a smooth base for my makeup.,1.0
"Great Smell, made my skin really tight. I love a lot of the other products and really wanted to love this one too.",0.0
"I love the texture of the cream and the overall feeling of the mask. It’s similar to applying marshmallow spread in your face, but in a fun way! I could see the glow afterwards, but after using PHAT 3 times this week, as recommended, I began noticing that pimples and blackheads are starting to appear, therefore I will not be using this product anymore, or maybe not as often as I did. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0
"I WISH I FOUND THIS PRODUCT SOONER! First of all, this product smells absolutely amazing!!!!!! second, this helped with my acne soooooo much!!!!!! I rarely ever breakout and when I do it Is during my monthly and even than this stuff prevents it from getting worse!! When I feel a pimple coming on I put this stuff on and its gone after a day or two. I literally rarely ever have zits or breakouts now. I’m assuming their main ingredient is the cause of this miracle for me is the salicylic acid which is for acne! (skin types differ of course)",1.0
"I’ve been using Algenist eye cream for the past 2 weeks and I have already started noticing a difference in my under eye area. My under eye area is significantly brighter, my under eye bags have reduced, the area is hydrated and healthy looking. The product was gifted by Algenist.",1.0
This moisturizer is soo nice leaves the skin looking super smooth and hydrated. the only downside is that I can’t seem to make it work with makeup. It separates like crazy and I’ve tried lots of different products with it,1.0
"I really enjoy products that leave my skin feeling fresh and clean, even better if they can remove my makeup in one go. During Halloween/October I use a lot of grease paint to do fun looks, and that stuff is so tedious to remove, but this precleanse went above and beyond and was able to cut through all of that, leaving me with clean, fresh, soft skin. I loved how hydrated my skin felt afterward and how easy it was to rinse off, the scent is mild but refreshing and as someone with sensitive skin, it was nice to not experience any irritation. This is an all around wonderful product and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good precleansing oil. *I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica",1.0
"As someone with really sensitive skin, I will warn you that you might want to ease into using this by starting with it every few days rather than every day, as BHAs are always pretty harsh on my skin when I first start using them. But once I worked it into my routine more regularly, my skin adjusted.While I don’t see a strong effect on my oiliness/pores (my pores are HUGE, ugh), I do think it’s been a key part of my skincare routine as far as keeping acne at bay. My skin has been so clear ever since using this, and I notice a difference when I don’t use it. I recommend at least trying the smaller size if you’re hesitant!",1.0
"Super rich and hydrating without being oily. For me definitely more of a winter cream than summer, though. Great moisturizer.",1.0
"How did I make it through my first 52 years without this product??  Farmacy’s Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm does exactly what it says--it melts away makeup.  It only takes a small amount and very light massaging to remove even waterproof eyeliner and mascara.  It smells clean.  It does not sting.  It rinses away and leaves my skin feeling dewy and super clean.  There are oodles of great products available to us, but I am IN LOVE with this cleansing balm.",1.0
"Not crazy about the texture and the film it leaves behind. Got a sample of it in the clean me up Sephora kit and while it does take off your makeup, it seemed to leave some kind of orange discolouration on my makeup eraser. My face felt greasy after using this, which I’ve had no issues with other oils and balms before. I had to use a LOT of this to get a very minimal amount of makeup off, for my other cleansing oil I use two pumps and that’s it. There are better options out there.",0.0
"I’ve been using this product for almost 15 years as part of my Clinique, three-step skincare routine. I love how fresh and soft my skin feels after using it. I will continue to use it for years to come.",1.0
"I LOVE this product it was amazing!! It did everything the bottle said it would do. My skin was so soft, dewy, hydrated, I didn’t have redness for several hours, and my skin simply looked amazing all around. 10 out of 10 would recommend.",1.0
Love this it has a cooking affect while it’s fights my daily blemish or to all while still be somewhat hydrating,1.0
Absolutely amazing. My skin is so dry and this serum really has helped. My skin doesn’t feel tight any longer when I put this on after I wash it. Really helped with my eczema too. Didn’t aggravate it at all. I’ve repurchased it 3 times,1.0
Very hydrating and repaired my dry skin well. Unfortunately the awful smell and the awkward container just kinda make it hard for me to use on a regular basis.,0.0
"I was not sure about this product at first.  However, after trying it for one week, others started asking about me.  They said I looked energized and had a positive radiance.  My skin felt refreshed and in the Gulf coast heat it did not become oily later in the day.  I highly recommend this product.",1.0
"This product is by far the most effective acne dots I have tried. The price is high, but it is totally worth it. I have tried a couple best review products available on Amazon with lower prices, but those take so long and do not compare to this Peace Out Acne Dots at all. This product pulls the gunk from acne in about 2 days (3 days at most) from applying it in the morning and at night. Also, the serum in the same line works well as well. I highly recommend this. At least give it a try. You will understand why it has its high price coming with great effectiveness.",1.0
This serum is definitely a new go to in my skincare routine. I can definitely feel the extra moisture in my skin it makes me look so glowy. It also makes for the perfect base for make up but it’s not even necessary because this makes your skin look amazing.,1.0
"Best moisturizer I’ve ever used, hands down.",1.0
"I love this product! I typically fall between the fairest shade and the second fairest shade, but neither is ever quite right. Using this gives me the coverages and color correction I want, and it creates the perfect match to my skin color. It creates the perfect no make-up look!",1.0
"Super nourishing, I have slightly sensitive skin and this is the perfect night moisturizer. Love it!",1.0
"****I have sensitive skin and this peel didn’t irritate my skin at all. within two or three application, you will see the dramatic difference on the your face. apply a serum or moisturizer afterward. “ IM ALIVE KINDA FEELING“ especially with the current condition in getting to my dermatologist.  I brought the sample just in case. Will purchase this again!!! Don’t forget to wear your sunscreen it’s vital:) Thank you., Dr. Gross lol...",1.0
I got this product as a sample. I love using this on a freshly cleaned face. It makes my skin very smooth and also makes it shiny. The design is very cute as well. I am a big fan of the use of honey in this product. My mom loves using this product because she has very dry skin.,1.0
"I’m 19y/o and have dry/sensitive skin. This has been a game-changer for me. I use it over top of my other toners/serums, kind of like a pre-moisturizer, then I use my occlusive on top. Could not recommend it enough if you have dry skin!",1.0
"I have heard about Keihl’s Facial Cream for years but never gave it a try - now I wish I had sooner! I have combination skin so parts are dry and other areas are oily. I also have rosacea so I’m sensitive, too. This moisturizer could not be better for helping with all of those issues! The texture of this moisturizer is amazing - so smooth and not sticky or thick. It’s lightweight and doesn’t feel heavy at all, but also leaves my skin feeling moisturized and plump. It’s so hard to find this happy medium but Keihl’s has done it. I also love that it’s fragrance free - it literally smells like nothing, which I very much prefer.",1.0
"I got this as a reward sample. After one application it completely changed the condition of my skin. My face felt soft, smooth, and even in complexion. Definitely worth the price.",1.0
I was sent this product complimentary from glow recipe  for review purposes. This glow serum is the perfect addition to the original watermelon glow moisturizer! Perfect for those days when your skins is feeling a bit dry snd needs an extra boost of moisture!,1.0
This makes a big difference in my redness and unevenness. I always wear makeup but almost feel like I could skip it using this.,1.0
"at first it didn’t do much but then one day i got a pimple and i put some of this on it and left it overnight and in the morning the pimple was gone. still hard to tell though if it makes a difference otherwise (for blemishes, pores)",1.0
"I tried this cream 2 times, I have dry skin and this works great to keep my skin hydrated without the oily feeling . It’s really good for daily use .",1.0
"I saw a pretty good difference with using this product. After a few uses, I noticed that the dark circles seemed lighter and I looked more awake.",1.0
"Get. It. This stuff is great with cell turnover, which helps with a lot of skin concerns. Right when I put this on my face my skin started to tingle, when I went to take it off, my pores were substantially smaller and it felt like my skin was breathing & my skin looked glowing. I already can tell I will see great results when I use this more.",1.0
This is a really nice product it goes on smooth and be smells great does. It leave a greasy feeling on my skin ethier and it helps wake me up some this stuff does not make me break out ethier I have precariously tried decal other products that after I use them I break out more than I wa sbefore,1.0
"It’s has a different consistency than most serums I’ve used, and I love it. This one is very light and creamy, and soaks completely into my skin. I felt and seen a difference immediately. My skin feels super hydrated (not sticky or oily)   visibly more vibrant, diminishing any lines. Can definitely be used as a makeup primer, it creates a smooth and even canvas. I received this product from Influenster.",1.0
"Are these wipes expensive? Yes. Are they going to solve problems you didn’t even know you had? Yes. Are they going to do your homework? Pay your bills? Cook you dinner? Yes yes yes.I purchased the 60 pack and used them every day for about 3 weeks, and then slowly started to stretch them out, using them every other day and now every 2-3 days in combination with retinol products from The Ordinary. Immediately, they feel nice, but the true benefit comes after a few weeks of use. I noticed better overall texture, less hyperpigmentation, smaller pores around my nose and center of my face, even a decrease in forehead wrinkles. If you’re a skincare junkie who likes to splurge on facials at the spa, this mega-box will cost as much as (or less than) 2 facials, but the payoff will be much higher. I highly recommend this product, and will definitely be buying it again.",1.0
"I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. I purchased the full size after using the duo. It made such an amazing difference after only one use. My face has never been so soft just from a cleanser. It has also really made a difference in the dryness from the cold weather. I love the exfoliating factor, as well a the great cause Tatcha is behind. With it being natural and cruelty free is just a really great bonus. Highly recommend!",1.0
Takes all my makeup off with such ease! I bought the bigger pack because I love the smell and its actually very gentle on the skin. I love it!,1.0
"I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and let me tell you it has saved my skin from maskne! I have oily skin and i was hesitant on using this, but I definitely recommend if you are experiencing maskne and you were a mask basically all day. It has not broken me out and I have oily and acne prone skin! 10/10 recommend.",1.0
It really works!!  This is the best serum I have tried.  I have large pores and always trying to hide them.  I can use this and all I need is some sunscreen and a very light foundation.,1.0
"This is my go-to day moisturizer.  It’s on the lighter side, so I occasionally mix in a bit of my evening moisturizer on dryer days. Doesn’t make my skin break out, and has a really lovely and light fresh scent and texture.  It’s not a ton of product, but a little goes a long way - it takes me about seven weeks to get through a container.",1.0
I got this product as a sample and loved it! It is nice and light and a perfect moisturizer for me. It sits nicely over other products and feels really hydrating.,1.0
I was so excited to get this product. I incorporated it into my nightly routine for the past week. I love how gentle it is and the fact that there isn’t a scent. It goes on so smoothly. The ingredients dress me to this product as retinoids and poppy seed extract have been proven to fight against aging which is what I was looking for.,1.0
"This was gifted by the brand in exchange for my honest review. I have tried and loved multiple things from the brand before, and let me tell you that this is EXACTLY what I have needed for my dry skin. My skin has been absolutely dehydrated this winter and this has SAVED my skin. It does leave a slight residue when you apply it onto the skin, but it melts in within a couple of hours..",1.0
"Terrible. Too thick. Do not use, rubbing your face this hard is not good for your skin. Doesn’t wash off makeup completely either.Sadly nothing beats Shu Uemura in cleansing oil.",0.0
My favorite product so far from the ordinary.  Have seen results in my skin after a month of use.,1.0
Always a repurchase for me! I have tried the exfoliating and regular ones and I love both. They’re awesome for removing makeup and if I’m feeling lazy I sometimes use them for a quick cleanse compared to actually washing my face.,1.0
"Not to much of a fan. It left my skin feeling super oil and greasy, when I looked to see my face was like a oil slick. I do not even like it as a over night cream. Guess it would be okay for after a treatment or on super dry skin but I can not use it. Gifted by Skinfix.",0.0
I received the Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen complimentary from Innisfree.  This is a broad spectrum SPF36. It comes in a very sleek tube which is easy to hold on to.  Very easy to open. What I like about it is that it has a very light scent. It goes on very smoothly and I did not have to reapply after a few hours in the sun.,1.0
"So, I wanted to love this ... I really thought it would work wonders but it left me with small white bumps. It did moisturize and calm my sensitivity but it clogged my pores. I have sensitive skin and easily get breakouts - if I use a product that doesn’t say ‘non-comedogenic’. If you don’t have sensitive and acne prone skin, then this is for you! I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes.",0.0
"Seriously one of my holy grail products! It absorbs super fast, super light weight ANDDDDD smells like orange creamsicles lol! I use it as a night time moisturizer and i wake up witth my skin looking glowy and feeling smooth!",1.0
"Love the product! So soft and nice. Wish their was less air in the packaging and more product because you need to press really hard to get any product out, you don’t really taste the flavor but it’s a nice color",1.0
"Its affordable and I quite like it. It didn’t do anything amazing for my skin nor did it worsen its condition. Its a light morning moisturizer and I thinks its best suited for normal skin types, or maybe combination because personally I have combo skin and it still like it and use it every morning.",1.0
"This moisturizer was too greasy for my skin and sat on top of my skin without really absorbing... After an hour after the application, I went to rinse my skin off because it was just making my skin feel gross. I may choose to use this on another part of my body (like my feet or legs) to use up the rest of it, but it did not do well for my face.",0.0
My skin felt rejuvenated and fresh after a couple times using this product! I was having issues with dark under eyes and just looking tired in general but this product “woke my skin up” so I could look and be ready to tackle the day.,1.0
Used in combination with the Hylauronic serum it worked well under makeup as long as I used a primer.,0.0
"Really enjoying this toning solution it’s helped my skin. The texture has improved, pores get attention",1.0
Makes you look bright eyed and bushy tailed like a vacation in a bottle. Really smooths the skin around your eyes. Application is key remember to lightly pat w/ring finger.,1.0
I personally enjoyed. It took a a few tries to get the right products in. (Switched out my day time moisturizer etc) I only add 2-3 drops to my face after my toner has been absorbed fully and I also allow this to dry for 3-5 min. That way the sticky feeling doesn’t happen.,1.0
Wow! I love this cleanser. My skin has never looked so good. Works great on my sensitive skin.,1.0
"I have been using this product for a few weeks and really enjoy it. I use it approximately every other night for extra moisture on top of my YTTP glow oil. My skin feels well hydrated and smooth after application, especially the next morning. On the nights I do not use this, I use a Beautycounter peel. My all-time favorite face product is YTTP glow oil. That used in conjunction with this cream   the BC peel leaves my skin smooth and glowing. I have been a YTTP product user for a while now and love it. I was ecstatic when they sent me this product as a sample to try.",1.0
This product was gifted by LaMer in exchange for  my honest opinion...so I waited to do this review in the event that my skin reacted but after a week all I could say is wow this product is powerful...my dull dry skin looks so much more healthier and shinier. I absolutely love the texture of my skin and how much moisture it has drawn back to my face. I highly recommend this product especially now that the summer is. Around the corner it will hydrate your skin and keep it looking young,1.0
love this product.  Add one drop to my facial moisturizer and two to my body cream for a healthy summer glow.,1.0
love this face stick! it’s easy to use since it’s in this packaging. it smells great and doesn’t feel too oily.,1.0
"Don’t debate just buy , I’ve been using this toner since it first came out and I absolutely love it. Definitely a skincare must have, it leaves your skin hydrated and I love the smell. Also helps with breakouts. I have oily combo skin. I’ve recently introduced this to my 19 yr old sister who has acne scares and uneven skintone and we both have seen it fade away. Just purchase. You won’t regret it",1.0
"It’s hard to find anything that I don’t love about this. The results really speak for themselves. I used to wake up in the morning with dry skin almost flaking off my lips (even after applying lip balm), but after using this for months, I’ve noticed a day and night difference. Beyond waking up every morning with comfortable, hydrated lips, the product itself is delightful and easy to use. The berry scent is pleasant, but there’s no taste to the product itself; the texture is like vaseline (just as slick and stiff) but it feels lighter and more hydrating, the little applicator makes it so easy to scoop out a generous amount of the balm and smooth it over your lips. If you have $20 to spend, buy this.",1.0
"This is a nice oil for night time before bed after cleansing. It sits nicely on the skin without leaving it greasy. It has a very light earthy scent and applies nicely with fingertips, you don’t need much alittle goes a long way.",1.0
I have combination skin and it’s been a challenge to find a moisturizer that I feel isn’t too heavy and greasy but still packs enough weight to tackle my dry patches. I’ve been loyal to this gel cream for over a year now and I’m very satisfied with how well it works with my skin. My only complaint is that the price could’ve been just a little lower.,1.0
"Okay I know this is kind of expensive for a cleanser but it’s so good.  It takes off all my makeup easily and my face always feels clean after.  A little goes a long way and it’s very gentle.  I have combination skin and my face never feel too oily or dry after using it. Some people said it smells bad but mine doesn’t smell like anything so I’m not sure where they’re getting that from.  Overall I would try it if you’re looking for a good face wash, especially one that removes makeup, but be careful because you’ll probably get hooked on buying it again and again like me haha",1.0
"Amazing moisturizer. I finally found a great moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and literally glowing. Before this moisturizer my skin was oily and prone to breakouts. When i started using this 2x a day, morning and night, i had a small breakout on my forehead and within a few days my skin was better than before the breakout ! The moisturizer smells fresh and is clean sealed meaning it’s free of certain unwanted ingredients. Origins can do no wrong it seems. Thank you to Influenster for providing this as apart of a voxbox to test this new moisturizer.",1.0
I normally use the Peter Thomas Roth vitamin C serum which is my holy grail. I thought I would see if this was as good as…or better with benefits of saving $20 and this being clean. To compare the two…this isn’t as moisturizing so maybe it’s better in the Summer. It doesn’t provide the “glow” like the PTR. I agree with others that it doesn’t absorb as well and changes the look of my foundation. I tried mixing it with the DE peptide cream and that seemed to help. It didn’t irritate my skin which is good. I don’t know if it compares to the skin ceauticals but the PTR is superior in my opinion. I will only use this when I’m feeling oily on no makeup days.,1.0
Holy Grail Moisturizer!  Cannot believe how soothing & protective this is.  Please don’t ever discontinue.  Feels amazing.  Makes my skin look amazing.,1.0
"Ole is one of my favorite brands and this did not disappoint. It smells great, a little fruity. I’ve been using for a about 4 days now it leaves a great matte finish which does make lines less noticeable. I’m exited to see if it helps fade some old scars I have with aha’s",1.0
Amazing! It feels like water melting  into your skin I recommend it.,1.0
"I was so excited to try this product! It doesn’t smell and was easy to apply BUT even after applying 6 drops, I had zero color change.  Very disappointing",0.0
I love a product that helps keeping my face clean and youthful looking! Product goes on easily and doesn’t have a nasty smell lile some peels can have. I received this for free from Pinchme.,1.0
"I have hyper sensitive skin and easily allergic reactions but a lot of facial creams. This is the only cream that has ever worked for me. It healed all the little bumps, and imperfections. Perfect complementary for my skin.",1.0
I absolutely love this product. My skin is so soft. I have normal/combination oily skin in the summer and I can still use this. I was nervous because it says it is for dry skin. I use a thin layer of this at night because a tiny bit goes a long way. Would so recommend.,1.0
I really liked the feel of this eye cream! I have been using it every day at least 1-2x per day but for only 2 weeks. I haven’t noticed much of a different in my wrinkles but I do love the moisturizing feel. I will keep using it in hopes it’ll work on my wrinkles and because I like the feel of it. Left pic is of the first time I tried it and right is two weeks later.,1.0
"I was actually hesitant about trying a new facial cream, but I’ve been needing a face cream that would moisture my skin. I’ve used body lotions, but my face is very sensitive to lotions. I tried this cream and I was surprised how well my face enjoyed it. It was gentle, had no strong perfume smell, and absorbed in my skin without any nasty residue.Would I buy again? Definitely!",1.0
"It is winter cream for my sensitive combo skin. In the summer, it is a little bit too much. It saved my skin through the dry winter, absorbs very well, and doesn’t break me out. Other than that, I don’t see much change it makes to my skin. But for me, it does its deep moisture function so good and it is enough.",1.0
"I love this cleanser. It doesn’t live up to all the hype I got from multiple Sephora employees, but it’s still pretty darn good. It leaves my skin soft and not completely stripped like a lot of cleansers have done for me, and as an added bonus, it removes most of my makeup so I don’t need to rub my skin as much as I would using only my micellar water.",1.0
First thing I love is that this product featured a refillable pod which is amazing because I like to terracycle or upcycle my leftover skincare. The formula is so hydrating and it’s perfect pair is the plum plump serum. My skin was glowing and hydrated all day. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling like silk. This is the perfect addition to my routine especially for winter when my skin tends to be a little more dry.,1.0
Loves this cleanser. I have acne prone skin and this has been the only cleanser to help my skin. Since using this I haven’t had as many breakouts. Love how this feels on my skin!,1.0
"Loved the product!!...I have oily skin and I was a little worried for trying this out but luckily it did not make my face oilier or anything, it leaves my face really clean without drying it out. I’m starting to love this brand specially because it’s all natural. Two thumbs up!",1.0
"the face feels “refreshing“ but it is a poor makeup cleanser. My toner catches the leftover foundation on my face! And there is a lot. I have such stubborn blackheads due to using this! If this cannot clean majority of foundation, how deep do you think it will clean your face, your pores? The ingredient listed gives you a cooling, refreshing sensation but sensation is not cleansing.",0.0
"Good for depuffing in the morning but doesn’t help with brightening. Was sad to see that my eyes looked basically the same after continuous use of this product. Also, even though it’s unscented it sometimes causes my eyes to sting.",0.0
"I am beyond impressed with my results. This milky white serum had a silky and luscious feel on my skin and had a light refreshing spa-like scent. My skin instantly looked smoother, my fine lines and pores minimized, visibly saw plumper and radiant skin, and could feel the immense hydration and strengthening of my skin barrier. This is absolutely my honest review and am really astonished by how well this improved my dry skin. Out of all the serums I have used, this is on the top of my list.",1.0
"At first I liked how this moisturized my skin, but then I noticed I was itching my face more and more. Once I stopped using it the itching stopped. It might just be my skin, but I won’t be repurchasing.",0.0
Gold standard for exfoliating treatment. Have always been disappointed when I stray! Even have my friends hooked on it.,1.0
"I have dry acne prone skin and I like to use a hydrating serum with my acne or anti-aging serum. This is wonderful! I have used the glossier bounce serum in the past and I don’t feel like it did anything. I also got a sample of the clinique moisture surge serum and these serums are equally as good! I will be purchasing this one from now on though! I care about my skin and am willing to invest but if I can get the same or better results for a fraction of the price, I will take this route. This sinks into my skin quickly and I do notice that it is more plump and hydrated. I highly recommend this product and brand!",1.0
I really like this product. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all. I notice smoother skin for sure. I also got viatamin c serum and the the face cream and banana bright eye cream in the holiday pack and I am hooked. I love everything I bought from this line. Not to forget about the face jelly cleanser that is amazing. Do not hesitate to purchase,1.0
"This is similar to confidence in a cream by it cosmetics. It makes my skin so soft!! It is a heavy cream so I use it at night before bed. When I wake up, any sign of dryness has vanished and my skin is so smooth! Took off a star because it does make my skin a bit greasy",1.0
"I always find these overhyped products to be just that usually. My first impression was how beautiful the texture was, like a silky balm that actually does “melt”’into your skin. I also love the smell, very fresh and clean.  However, this burned my eyes SO bad I was left with blurred vision and red, irritated eyes for hours after I used this.  I don’t wear heavy eye makeup at all, some eyeliner and mascara and it did an “ok” job as best at removing it, not any better than any other cleaner I’ve used.  I decided to try it on the rest of the face and hated the feeling it left behind, slightly oily and just unclean. I had to follow up immediately with my Tatcha cleanser. I’ve used this a few times and noticed some breakouts, not sure if it was from or a new makeup I have been trying. Regardless, the eye reaction is more than enough reason for me to not try it again.

"I absolutely love this! I can really tell a difference with my skin. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now, my skin is more smooth, pores are smaller and it’s glowing!",1.0
"I absolutely ADORE this product. It’s so soft and smooth, smells amazing, and removes makeup and dirt SO WELL. I use it every night, and it lasts for a while too. I’ve had it for about 3 months and it’s still going strong. Works great on sensitive skin.",1.0
I absolutely love this product! It gets all of my stubborn eye makeup off and a little goes a long way. I will say you have to warm the product up in your hand to get into a buttery or non-clumpy texture.,1.0
So fabulous. I hate when balms are too thick and hard to spread. The belief one is sooo smooth and easily to spread on your face without pulling. Just get it fr.,1.0
I have combination to oily skin. I get oily in my T zone. Though the sample I received was quite small it was hard to say whether it made a dramatic difference. The moisturizer has a great light feeling consistency. I love the fact that it does not have a strong scent. It felt really great on the skin.  My skin looked plump and smooth the next morning. I wished that the sample size was a bit bigger to allow me to see it’s true effects.  I received this product as a free sample from Influenster and Clinique to test and give my honest review.,1.0
I like how smooth skin is after I apply it. but I didn’t see an incredible result that other brands can’t give me so far. It’s okay but nothing special to be honest,0.0
"This new flavour does not smell or taste sweet at all. It is like perfume or lotion on your lips. I had to remove it right away. Too strong and a scent/taste that should not be on your lips, IMO.",0.0
"I have used this for over a year now. I do not generally have sensitive skin. I started with 10 minutes, and now use the full 20 minutes without any problems. I had my grandmother try it for 10 minutes and my mother who has sensitive skin for 10 minutes and they both tolerated it fine. It works hard, keeps skin smooth and decongested. highly recommended. this is one of the top products in my skin routine.",1.0
"I found this gem and love how it glides on and moisturizes my eyes overnight.  You don’t have to touch any product at all.  The best thing about it, it lightened my 2 dark spots around my eye area dramatically so I just bought my second stick. Received free product",1.0
I received this product complimentary from influenster. I used it for 3 weeks already. At first I had a little breakout but Everytime I use something new my skin has an adjustment period. After that my skin was soft and smooth! However I do not like the smell. I wish they sold it without that fragrance.,1.0
My favorite day eye cream. I love the texture - it glides under eyes perfectly and hydrates all day. The best part is how well it works under makeup. It’s flawless and actually improves the way my concealer looks under my eyes. I also really like the pump. You only need a little bit of product so don’t be deterred by the price. There is a lot of value with this product if you use the appropriate amount per day.,1.0
"So so so good! I had been struggling with texture and blackheads on my nose for the last year. I tried blackhead removing strips, Murad’s multi acid peel, Origins charcoal mask and soooo many other things but nothing worked. These pads however...ONE use got rid of 75% of the texture on my nose and the rest of my face. I’ve tried both the Extra Strength and Universal peels by DDG and as these are now a permanent part of my routine I settled on universal just because I don’t think my skin needs such intense treatment on a daily basis. Highly highly recommend.",1.0
I wanted to love this product but it really irritated my skin. It especially bothered the skin around my eyes.,0.0
"I absolutely love this exfoliant! My skin is very oily and I’m so impressed by the scrubbing power.  But since the granules dissolve, it’s very gentle at the same time. My skin (and pores!) feel so clean and fresh afterwards. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling",1.0
"I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I must say that I have enjoyed it. I like the feel of it, it feels luxurious and smooth. It’s not too drying or irritating. The smell isn’t bad either and it’s not too strong. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because as much as it cost it should be 7 oz not 5 oz. However, if they did increase the size then they shouldn’t increase the price of the $23.",1.0
"I had my eye on this product for a bit and I was so excited when influenster sent it to me, and it did not disappoint, it’s a great product you just have to make sure to shake it before you use it and once you apply it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling on the skin at all, a little bit goes a long way and it is a huge jar compared to most of my sunscreens",1.0
"This product makes me wonder why I ever spent so much money on cleansers. I recently decided to incorporate salicylic acid into my routine even though I don’t really break out like that. I get occasional hormonal breakouts but nothing crazy. I worried that since the mask mandate is back in my gym, that I would start breaking out around my chin from wearing the mask while working out. I can happily report that this has done wonders for my blackheads and my pores. FOR THE FIRST TIME in my very expensive skin care journey, I can finally say my skin looks even, the pores minimized and overall good tone to my skin and I attribute that a lot to this cleanser. It has made me want to try more inkey list and start questioning the efficacy of my other expensive skin care products. Amazing.",1.0
After purchasing this cream for extremely dry and cracked skin I was very excited to finally restore moisture to my face again. The first night I broke out with large pimples. I discontinued use for a week. Tried again for two different nights the following week and the same horrible breakouts ensued. By the third week the oil had separated from the cream and started squirting out first before any cream. Also not a huge fan of the grainy cream that comes out. You have to rub it down before the grain melts away. I give this two stars because it does keep your face moist and soft but aggressively clogs your pores at the same time.,0.0
"I got this in the mini size to try it out first just to see how I would like it/see how my skin might react to it and honestly, I love it. literal game changer moisturizer!! it feels so luxurious and smooth on the skin and it makes me look so hydrated and glowy!!",1.0
"It is an amazing product. I usually go to Ulta for The ordinary and stopped into sephora. They had my favorite product but in a bigger size! I was super excited, purchased it and went about my way. Get home all is well, at least so I thought. Used the product before bed, go about my day the next morning. Well apparently my cat chose violence that morning and did not enjoy the product and smashed it to a liquid hazard. I will certainly be buying again and will be sure to keep it far away from my cats violent tendency.",1.0
"Holy moisture! I thought it would feel heavy but this cream sinks in like no other & appears to work its magic, as fine lines erase. I love this moisturizer!",1.0
"Absolutely love this product. I originally thought for the price it was going to be too much. However, it has lasted me over 1 1/2 years!!! I use it semi-regularly as a night cream (leave on all night). I have very dry skin and this helps to solve that for me. I have acne prone skin with acne scaring and this helps to lighten those scars. A little really goes a long way with this product.",1.0
This is very silky and smells great. This is a wonderful product. It works and really seems to protect my skin. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t feel greasy.,1.0
I received this product to try through influenster.  It is very lightweight and has a pleasant floral scent.  I have been putting it on every morning since my skin has been dry and it has helped to mosturize my face.  I typically let it dry for about 15 min before applying makeup.,1.0
"This serum boasts a double serum powered by plant based extracts. This includes turmeric, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, but also anti-aging effects. It is suitable for sensitive skin, and all skin types. The serum has an oil-based appearance, with a pleasant scent. It applies easily and smoothly, while absorbing quickly. I could feel a slight warmth from the turmeric. My skin felt energized, and glowing.",1.0
"Feels luxuriously creamy and smells expensive. Like, I have my own private jet and a trophy boyfriend expensive. Loved how it felt on my face on the dry Colorado winter. Unfortunately it broke me out. I have sensitive skin. So I’ve been using it on my neck and collarbone instead. Those places age too!",1.0
Hurts skin when applied to face. I wish I could get a refund. Now I don’t know what to do with it since I can’t using it at all,0.0
"I have combo/normal skin, I get dry in winter and oilier in the summer. I like glowy foundations, powders and concealers, I’m fine looking like a donut…The first thing I thought was: this smells so bad(floral pine-sole but worse?)… why does is feel like vaseline… I feel like I put grease on my face and I’m gonna break out if I keep using it…That’s the only “plumping” sensation I got.Got it for the Sephora birthday gift and it didn’t live up to the hype, I’ll stick to my gel moisturizers. Only get this if your skin is in a constant state of the Sahara and crackling like a reptile and even still tread lightly.",0.0
Very gentle cleanser.  It has a  very pleasant smell and a nice consistency. Easily removed my waterproof mascara. It left my face feeling soft and not tried out.,1.0
"I received this serum complimentary from Fresh. This is a beautiful serum for my combination to dry skin that boosts my skin’s visible resilience. It has a milky texture that absorbs beautifully into my skin without leaving a sticky feeling. The serum has a nice fresh tea scent. It feels very hydrating and makes my skin feel silky smooth, soft and makes my skin look bright with a radiant glow. After using this serum consistently twice daily I have noticed that my dull and aging skin has a smoother texture, feels more supple, fine lines are less visible and my it provides my skin with a beautiful glow. I can’t wait to see the results after using it for a longer period. I highly recommend this beautiful serum!",1.0
"Yes, the price tag is high but the product works. it helped me improve my skin texture and the smell is divine",1.0
"Did nothing for me although I have oily t-zone, huge pores and blackheads. They hurt when I removed them and my pores looked exactly the same. Will use them as a pimple patch when I get huge zits",0.0
"Received a smaller size in a favorites box about a week ago. Not only has my face reduced in break outs but the overall appearance is better. Yes, the smell is very distinct at first and I hated it...but oddly I’ve grown to liking it. A thin layer works wonders and its lasting me awhile... I’ve used four times and still have over half the container. Will be buying more :)",1.0
I received a free sample of this product in exchange for a review. I definitely liked this cleanser. The texture was really nice and smooth and it made my skin feel clean and smooth after use. My only complaint is that I’m not sure if it’s worth the price. You can find something just as nice for a fraction of the price.,1.0
"To start this off, my skin never knows what it wants. It’s extremely acne prone and sensitive. With that in mind, I can use this cleanser a couple times a week as an exfoliator and I have no issues. The exfoliating beads are a little strange in the sense that there aren’t many and they’re large. So when I’m washing my face, it doesn’t feel like they’re exfoliating much. But it does make my face super soft, so I know it’s doing something. I’m not sure I’ll buy this again, but I’ll definitely finish the bottle. P.S. the bottle is annoying because it’s hard to get the right amount of product out.",1.0
"I ended up really enjoying this product. Love the application, smell and result.",1.0
"This whipped creamy texture felt silky during application. It took about a minute to fully absorb into my eye area.  It does not leave any residue behind. Non oily. I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It did seem to calm some under eye discoloration. But It Did not depuff my eye area nor did it minimize my lines.  However, I have not used the product long enough to see any long term results. I will continue to use this product until it runs out.  At that time I can reassess and decide if it’s worth purchasing.",0.0
I had wanted to try these for a long time because of all the reviews but I never did until recently because they were a little pricey for cottons pads and I could get some at the dollar store for well...a dollar! But I was feeling a little bougie while restocking on some of my favorite Clinique Take the Day Off makeup remover and said why not! Let me tell you they are SO worth the hype! I’m never looking back at cheap cotton pads again! It just feels so gentle on my sensitive skin and it doesn’t fall apart and leave cotton wisps all over my face!,1.0
This stuff is amazing! I honestly didn’t have high expectations for it. But it makes my skin so glowy and manages to blur imperfections WHILE protecting me from the sun - what more could I ask for?!? It’s great on its own but also performs really well under a little light concealer or foundation. Highly recommend!,1.0
I received this product free. I love the way it feels on my skin and blends with my makeup. My face stays moisturized without looking oily.,1.0
This product is incredibly smooth and feels amazing on my skin. It truly lives up to its name because just the warmth of my fingers melted it into the skin around my eyes and after just a few uses they already feel more hydrated. My under eye area looks and feels smoother and healthier.,1.0
Lightweight. Fragrance free. Worked well w moisturizer,1.0
I have always loved belief products but this vitamin c serum is amazing. It gives you a wonderful glow and my face stays moisturized. Definitely recommend,1.0
"I absolutely love and swear by the quality of this product. Some salves I have found to be to thick or sticky, but for some reason my skin drinks this up. I use it every night before bed and first thing after I brush my teeth in the morning. This may seem strange to some, but if my cuticles are getting a little dry, I scoop about 1/2 a pea out and distribute it to all my nail beds - works wonders for this. Such a perfectly balanced product between efficiency and a light scent.",1.0
"Absolutely in love with this product. You have to stick with it, but it’s totally worth it! My skin is so much softer and radiant. Now I always have this heathy and beautiful glow. Gifted by Algenist.",1.0
I love using this as a primer. It helps mask my redness while sinking into my skin and even gets rid of some blemishes! I love it. I use it instead of my bb cream now and would suggest it to anyone with sensitive or uneven skin tones.,1.0
I received the product free from Influenster! I immediately loved the lightweight texture of the product and it also smells amazing. I have extremely sensitive  & dry skin and i loved how moisturizing this seem left my face. I definitely recommend,1.0
"I have dry skin. I’m not super acne prone, but it is very sensitive. I got this for a birthday gift and WOW I love it. I’m gonna have to buy the full size. It leaves my skin plump and glowy with the smallest amount. 10/10 from me.",1.0
Feels like water as it melts into the skin.  It’s perfect for the summer.,1.0
"I’ve struggled to find the right cleanser for my face and have bounced around trying to find the best one for my skin. I have skin that scars easily, and tends to get closed comedones very easily. I received a sample of this a while ago, and wanted to give it a longer trial. I’ve been using it for almost a month in combination with Farmacy’s Honey Drop moisturizer. I have also minimized my makeup routine. My skin feels so soft, and my closed pores are steadily getting worked away. I highly recommend it.",1.0
"This is by far my favorite cleanser.  It is light, fresh smelling and fully rinses away.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.",1.0
"Okay I’m actually obsessed with this product! It smells a little weird but you get used to that over time. Other than that, this stuff is so creamy and luscious and I’ve actually noticed some anti aging happening already after just a week! My skin feels plump and full of life!! I didn’t break out at all when I started to use it and it doesn’t make my face oily! I’ve noticed my cc+ cream doesn’t sit nicely on it so if I’m going to use that I only apply the moisturizer at night but other than that it’s a great product!",1.0
"Makes my skin so soft,smooth and glowy. This plus a primer and my makeup just glides on and has never looked better.",1.0
"This is not for women of color unless you want to walk around with an ashy, pale face. I would give this 0 stars if I could. I’m an African American woman with a lighter complexion. I’m glad I got a sample instead of buying it because when I put it on, I looked like a fool and took it off immediately. I have 2 other products by Dr. Jart+ that I adore, but this product was very disappointing. If you still want to try it, I highly suggest you get a sample to try AT HOME so you aren’t walking around looking crazy if you try it on in the store.",0.0
"It was an instant result! I finally found a product that hydrates my skin, doesn’t irritate it. It will for ever be my #1 serum! ❤️",1.0
"I had a few days of really bad breakouts and felt like my pimple cream was making them worse, so i decided to try this because it seemed to have pretty positive reviews. The next morning i woke up and noticed a significant improvement in my breakouts. I tend to have pretty sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate it at all.",1.0
"I applied with a cotton ball, and it has a nice cooling feeling when you first apply. I noticed less redness on my face within about 20 minutes. No stickiness. My skin felt soft and radiant, no  noticeable scent,  a nice product.",1.0
"Three stars because it applies evenly and I liked the way it looked under my foundation. Unfortunately, this product clogs my pores. That’s a deal breaker.",0.0
"Love, love, love.  I am in my early 40’s with dry sensitive skin.  This cleanser is the best I have ever used.  I have only used a few of YTTP’s products and have yet to be disappointed.",1.0
"I typically wake up with puffy eyes, so the caffeine boost in the morning has been incredible! One of Sunday Riley’s best products! My only negative is that for the price, I’d also like some additional anti-aging benefits for some fine lines.",1.0
"I wanted to love this product, as I am an avid Dr Jart skincare fan, BUT it made me break out and it doesn’t cover the way it’s intended for me. The serum is much more effective at covering redness and it doesn’t leave a residue. This one’s a pass.",0.0
"I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox to test and review. I’ve only used it consistently for the past 2 weeks, but I already see a difference in the texture and appearance of my skin on my face. I have extremely sensitive, oily and acne prone skin, and often products bother me, but this one does not. The smell of this product is so nice and refreshing, it’s not tacky or greasy and it absorbs instantly into your skin. I really love when products live up to their expectations, and this one does not disappoint. It will forever be a staple in my night time skin care routine.",1.0
"It works but is outrageously priced. I received a sample with a previous order and was able to try this for about ten days applying every night and my skin is clearer and brighter. It is definitely a noticeable difference which starts pretty well in the first few days but at this price, it’s very hard to justify. I have purchased a well-reputed dupe for less than ten dollars to see if it is comparable but I don’t see myself purchasing at this price point.",0.0
"When I received this product I did a test on my wrist and it felt very refreshing and with a mild aroma like lemongrass or something like that and it did not do any effect, but when applying it to my face I felt a little discomfort that disappeared after a few minutes. I don’t usually have sensitive skin, but with this product my skin reacted differently. On its packaging, the brand proclaims that within 3 minutes of putting the cream on your face it fills in the expression lines you have, I currently have 2 on my forehead because I am frowning at all times and shortly after smearing the product lines were filled in, but the next day they were there, so it’s not a magic product, so I guess you have to give it more time and see how everything turns out. It did not cause me allergies and it is soft and light in texture so it absorbs quickly into the skin.",1.0
"THE BEST face wash I have ever used, clears my skin right up every time I use it. This will be the only face wash I use for now on :) :)",1.0
Giving this eye cream 5 stars! The packaging is really cute and the product works wonders! I love the consistency and the boost of moisture it gives my eyes! I love how light weight it feels and there’s no fragrance!,1.0
"This stuff is amazing! Instead of just coating the lips in moisturizer, this stuff seems to sink into the lips and help sooth cracks and imperfections. I was pleasantly surprised by the results and sweet mint scent. I love that it is unisex as well.",1.0
"My skin is super oily and super acne prone and it’s been sooooo difficult for me to find the perfect non-greasy, oily sunscreen. This is a winner. It is super smooth on the skin and wear this every single day with nothing else. Mid- day my face is still not oily. Great buy. Pricey, but worth it.",1.0
I really like this moisturizer as the texture is amazing and light weight and does not leave your face sticky after use. Has neutral smell if any and works well with my skin care routine also did not cause any skin irritation feels very refreshing on your face.,1.0
"Hydration provided by this serum is sufficient (Not great), but what makes this a 2-Star instead of a 3- or 4-Star is that the serum dries HORRIBLY. It leaves a sticky, cakey residue behind that sticks to the tiny hairs on my face. Yuck. I guess you get what you pay for.",0.0
I received this complimentary from Dermalogica sampling. I really loved how soft this product made my skin feel it really helped get rid of the dead skin on my face. I was a little thrown off by the smell of the product but over all I enjoyed the outcome of it.,1.0
"On my second bottle, this stuff rocks. A perfect addition after a serum and before your moisturizer. Bought before a trip to the literal Kalahari dessert and was *so happy* I had this along. It kept my skin from total dry freak out in the midst of a desert. Now back in the real world it is the most perfect addition to my daily routine — works on my skin (sensitive, dry, pale) and my partner’s (oily, acne prone, dark) as a moisture boost. I use morning and night.",1.0
"I’ve tried a few peptide creams over the years and this was all right. Good but not great. Where I think it falls down is how log the hydration lasts. My skin feels great initially, but it loses that feeling quickly. I can’t speak to the anti angling benefits of peptides, as the sample was too small for that, but I certainly didn’t see any detrimental effects to my skin and it did feel nicely bouncy after application, but again, it didn’t last on my skin.",0.0
Really wanted to love this after all the rave throughout social media but it broke me out terribly. I thought it was my moisturizer making me oily and returned that but still! Totally wrecked my skin and dried my skin out so much :( sad to say I will be returning this,0.0
Received this in my trendmood box and I love it for the dry spots on my face,1.0
I was happy to try this lip treatment complimentary from fresh. The packaging feels high end and heavy which I like. The color application is also pigmented and beautiful. I personally didn’t find the lip treatment to feel hydrating. I actually felt like it made my lips feel a little dry.,0.0
"I;m an oily chick and I typically use Micellar water to first take off my makeup. I got this dream as a birthday gift and I have to say it literally melts your makeup. I put this cream on first and my eye makeup breaks up so easily. I absolutely despise taking off my makeup and then mascara is now pooled in my lower lash. With GREEN CLEAN,  that is not a problem. it is apart of my nightly routine. There is no residual makeup left even on my eyelashes. I traveled from Hawaii to New Hampshire with this Must Have product. Thank you for creating this....",1.0
I have combo skin and have been having dry spots and some breakout due to a reaction to another product. Using this everyday for 5 days immediately helped clear up my breakouts and addressed my dry spots. Also really helped add bouncy and vibrancy to my complexion and helps lock in and amplify the benefits from my other products. Little goes a very long way so this will last a while.,1.0
This feels like a gel cream and goes on super hydrating! I have combination skin and it’s been working well so far!,1.0
"Literal dupe for Drunk Elephant’s Baby Facial (one of my all time favorites) this is  an affordable version with very similar ingredients. I actually like the red color because you know you’ve washed off all of the acids, kind of wish DE would implement a color as well. Overall, great product.",1.0
"This product is one of a kind! It smooths texture, gives you glow, hydrates and plumps your skin! I apply day and night to my face and neck and the next morning the results are overnight! The scent is very mild and natural it doesn’t irritate the skin. A MUST HAVE!",1.0
"My favorite makeup remover! Before being introduced to this product by a beauty YouTuber, I had a vigorous makeup removal process where I used a makeup wipe, then micellar water, then facial wash, and even then I still had residue on my face. Once I started using this though, I cut down my routine as well as cut down waste (from the makeup wipes and cotton rounds). It also saved my skin from the damage of rubbing and tugging with wipes which made me love it even more.",1.0
"I have been using retinol for years and although I like the results, it’s so harsh on my skin I have to put a ton of moisturizer on and the retinol doesn’t necessarily make my skin feel super soft...And then in comes this serum! It glides over the skin super easily, it absorbs into the skin very well, it smells amazing (lavendar and vanilla), and when I wake up in the morning my skin is smooth, soft, and blemish free. It works just as well as my retinol and has an added bonus of more hydrated looking skin. I will definitely be incorporating this into my skincare regimen!I received this product complimentary testing purposes. All opinions are my own.",1.0
My lips were fine before using this product. I used it for about 2 weeks and my lips are constantly dry and burn all the time now. This lip mask honestly makes your lips more dry. Don’t waste your money.,0.0

I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. I have been using cetaphil for ages and needed a change. This doesn’t break me out!!! And leaves my skin feeling SO SOFT. I’m obsessed.,1.0

"I received this product as a free sample to try. I love OkeHenriksen products! This mask is super hydrating, the smell is amazing and it feels like a less sticky version of honey! It was amazing! It’s now part of my skin care. I  received this product  complementary for testing. I will be using it again!",1.0
I LOVE this serum!!! It’s so hydrating and really gives my skin that extra plump I always want especially in my under eyes! I definitely recommend.,1.0
I am in love with this product. Have been using it for two years and I swear by it. It’s done amazing things to my skin. I’m acne prone but with dry skin and have surface redness. This helps me be acne free and have a more glowy even complexion. I haven’t noticed much on my pores minimizing though. But love everything else about it. Holy grail for me.,1.0
"I love this moisturizer! It feels like a cold compress going on after a hot shower and it smells so nice. My skin feels smooth after putting it on, not sticky or dry. I highly recommend this product alongside the toner. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1.0
"Love the sunscreen coverage it provides, light feel of it, no stickiness, and a subtle, sun-kissed glow! Highly recommend!",1.0
"This is a wonderful cleanser with the loved Tatcha scent! The lufa fruit makes this a great every day exfoliating cleanser without being too aggressive for everyday use. This removes my makeup with the exception of my waterproof mascara like a dream and leaves my skin feeling clean and pampered! My only complainant is that it doesn’t remove Waterproof mascara easily but that is where the Camellia Oil comes in handy! The packaging is clean, sophisticated and all around aesthetically pleasing! I will repurchase and recommend!",1.0
This stuff is just the best. A few drops after cleansing prevents dry patches and gives my skin a nice overall glow.,1.0
"Was really hoping for that sunny glow without the damage as purported in the description. This poor little tube left me super greasy no matter how little I used, and the color was not complementary to my skin. I’m not even light so I thought it would at least blend into my medium/tan skin, but no. I ended up returning it. :(  BTW I’m an oily gal and had initially been assured by the beauty adviser in the store that this wouldn’t be slick or glittery on my face. She was wrong. lol",0.0
i received this product for free to test.it was really cool because of how it changes colour as you use it. the formula made my skin feel so great!,1.0
I have been using this cleaner for the past two and a half weeks and I can fully attest to it being a savior for combination skin. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean. From not leaving my skin overly dry or oily it will stay a staple in my skincare routine. Highly recommend.,1.0
I recieved this gifted by sunday riley. I’ve been using this for a few days and I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes have been reduced. I have somewhat sensitive skin so I only use this as a mask for about 10 minutes at night and then I rinse. I tried to use it as a serum but it made my face red. My pores look smaller already so I think the exfoliating benefits are my favorite and I actually really like the scent. I would recommend to anyone looking for an instant plumper for their skin and fine lines and to reduce the appearance of pores.,1.0
I’ve been using this about three weeks and the dark spots on my face are facing away. This one’s worth the splurge!,1.0
Hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. This moisturizer has been added to my nightly routine. It goes on so smooth and doesn’t leave me feeling like I have gunk on my face. It has made my face so much smoother using it along with the primer over the past month. I was so thankful to receive this product for Free to try and will definitely be purchasing it in the future.,1.0

"Holy grail product for me personally. Yes it’s expensive, I purchase the 11oz pump bottle once a year when sales hit and it stays much tidier and easier to use first (molecular weight order and all) after cleansing :)",1.0
"A little goes a long way, there is no weird smell to it, and my face feels completely clean and fresh after using this. I love the color.",1.0
"This is a smooth, medium-weight gel. It feels nice and fresh when cleansing. It made my oily/dry skin feel soft and refreshed. But I can def believe there are fruit extracts going on and in the worst way. Think of slathering on a bunch of freshly sliced lemons. The heavy fragrance makes it smell synethic, though this is supposed to be made without artificial fragrance. If you like the smell of Tatcha Water Cream, you’ll like this because it’s the same. But if you’re not into strong fragrance, steer clear of this one.",0.0
"My. Goodness.  I don’t have enough good things to say about this product. I’m turning 40 next year (gasp) and I noticed my skin was starting to look a bit dull. I’ve never had major skin issues, the only being dry skin. This DE Babyfacial definitely had a sting to it when it first went on. So much so, that the first time I tried it I almost wiped it off before my 15-20 minutes were up. I am so glad I persisted. My skin feels softer than anything I can imagine after using this product once a week. I’ve stopped going to my esthetician due to the pandemic, so I really don’t see the price of this product as being that steep for what you get. Highly recommended.",1.0
Left an oily film on my face that left my skin feeling dirtier than it started.,0.0
"I have really oily skin and acne prone skin and at the begging I was thinking that this moisturizer was not for me but it’s perfect, don’t leave an oily sensation and cause me breakouts, leave my skin so soft and help me to heal some acne scars. Love it",1.0
It’s alright I’ve had this for a few months. It’s a good sunscreen but it’s wayyyy to glowy for me and I have dry sensitive skin. This did work for me on my skin. I’m gonna try the other sunscreens in the brand.,1.0
"I tried this as a replacement for my holy grail (Tatcha) and this just wasn’t great. The smell is nice and I like the texture but my face still felt dry after using it. Also, this caused some breakouts on my skin which have disappeared since going back to Tatcha. It was just an eh.",0.0
This product is essential for anyone who struggles with cystic hormonal acne! It’s a life changer. I use it just once a day in the am,1.0
"I’ve been a long time fan of Tatcha skincare products, since I first discovered the Dewey Skin Mist (game changer!!) From the brand’s practices and approach to skincare, to the luxurious products and gorgeous packaging. I haven’t tried a product from this company, that was targeted for my skin type, that I didn’t absolutely love! So there was no doubt that I was going to like the Silk Peony melting eye cream. I have always suffered from dark under eye circles and bags, and unfortunately age has only accentuated these flaws. At first use, this cream glides on the skin and soaks right in. It has the smoothest texture and I noticed very early on that it had a plumping effect to my under eye. I’m not sure if this was the much needed moisture that my eyes were begging for, or if it’s the line smoothing technology. Either way, I’m in love! It sits beautifully underneath my concealer and it’s the first eye cream I’ve found that doesn’t crease or slide off when used with makeup. Pro-tip: use along with Tatcha’s Water Cream (or gel for oily skin) for skin so smooth that doesn’t need primer. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes (but I’d be just as pleased with it if I had purchased it myself).",1.0
"Surprisingly hydrating! I was using the Ole Henricksen one, I switched to this one to try and this one is way better for my dry skin. It feels nice, a bit more expensive but worth it in my opinion. Will be using this from now on.",1.0
"I lovvvvve this. It literally changed my dry patches overnight. I’m not overly dry, in fact usually I’m oily but this winter I’ve gotten some dry patches and just using this overnight and in the morning, it calmed my dry patches and moisturized my skin so nicely. I love that there’s no scent and the packaging is so cute!",1.0
"It is an incredible treatment, it helps me a lot with blackheads and reduces the size of my pores noticeably.I use it twice a week and it has given me excellent results.My skin looks hydrated, young and radiant, I am very happy to use it, I recommend it.",1.0
"In my experience, exfoliation products are rough since they use a substance like sugar or walnuts to remove the dead skin layer. What’s unique with Tatcha’s rice polish foaming enzyme powder is that it uses rice and papaya enzyme to exfoliate the skin. The powder turns into a foam after mixing with water and after using it on my skin it feels so soft. Love and cannot live without!",1.0
"I just started using this as my last step in my skincare routine. I was reluctant to the idea of an oil on my skin as I have combination skin, get oily in the t-zone and am sensitive in other areas. Well, I was wrong. This didn’t make me more oily or break me out. This made my skin so smooth and firm and gives it just the right amount of nutrition it needs. A little goes a long way and I definitely will repurchase this when I run out.",1.0
"I received this product complimentary from lamer.my wife loves it I tried it too it’s very moisturizing. I follow as the interactions says to warm up in finger other wise it’s feels greasy..smells is great,and a little goes a long way.",1.0
"This product is my go-to.I always end up coming back to it after trying other ‘cheaper’ cleanser...(and I try other options only because I always trying to save a buck here and there)... but I’ve come to realize that its price is justified. I love the smell. I love how fresh it feels (no pun intended), I love how soft it is. I love love love it.",1.0
"Was so excited to receive a sample. I have been hearing so many great things about this mask. Welp, too bad. This mask tore my face up. Burning almost instantly. The first time I used it I thought the burning maybe some weird affect from something I did. Then I used it again a few days later and the burning was worse. I have a Bobbi Brown mask that’s similar and I love it. I’ll still to that.",0.0
"In over 10 years of using Sephora exclusively for my skincare and makeup, this is the only item that I have ever returned. It dried my skin out and produced fine lines no matter how I used it: small dose, large dose, in conjunction with moisturizers.  For context, I have normal skin and I’m 32.",0.0
"BEST BALM EVER! I was recommended this product from a client, said their makeup melted off, so I had to try. Soooo satisfied with this cleanser. I have very dry skin, so the fact that it doesn’t strip my skin like most cleansers has been so great for me, literally a golden find. To top it off, it’s SO CHEAP! I’ve shown my friends and they love it, one of the best things to get at Sephora! The consistency is paste-like, if you’re oily, I recommend going in with another cleanser after this if you’re using this for solely taking off makeup. Great product that will save you from tearing and pulling your skin with makeup wipes or harsh cleansers, that will leave you with pre-mature wrinkles, lines, etc! Everybody needs this if you wear makeup!",1.0
"I recently started using the Dr Dennis Gross universal peel pads and cleansing gel and have loved my results, so I decided to purchase this (though I wasn’t crazy about the price) and WOW! My pores shrunk tremendously over night on the first use!! So happy I decided to add this to my regimen. I will say, for the reviews that say they’ve seen no difference, I credit my results from already having a good exfoliating regimen",1.0
"I really like this cleanser a lot. It’s gentle. It doesn’t really have a strong scent, it’s mild and nice but hard to describe. Very pleasant scent though. I enjoy the way it foams up while rubbing the product on my face and it doesn’t strip my skin. I have sensitive skin and it works well for me. I received this product complimentary to test and review.",1.0
"great smell, made my face seem so smooth and fresh!",1.0
I fell in love with this clear sunscreen stick. The product is incredible to use it before makeup. I really like the packaging and the size is ideal to carry it in your bag. I highly recommend it.  I received this product for free from influenster,1.0
"My friend gifted to me and it lasted about 10 months. I bought this and used once this 8 years ago, but at that time it caused me many breakouts and I didn’t like it.(It could be not because of this tho) But 8 years later, I used this and really love it! My skin becomes so soft next morning. I never felt my skin soft so much that I was very surprised. Will purchase again.",1.0
Love how smooth this product is on my lip. Gives me the perfect shine and this alone makes me look refreshed in the mornings so I love using it even for when I get on my zoom calls #WFHtings,1.0
"I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. This cream is excellent and I plan on purchasing a full size jar. I applied it to clean, damp skin morning and night. My skin was immediately supple and hydrated. It was moisturizing, which I love, because I have normal to dry skin and usually prefer products for dry skin. While this gave me the moisture I was looking for, it was not greasy. I applied the product at night when I first received this sample and in the morning the skin around my eyes looked plumper and tighter. My fine lines were less noticeable. My skin was smooth and my Double Wear foundation wore well over the top. I definitely recommend",1.0
"First thing I put on after washing my face! I am surprised there are negative reviews. I guess there are better working things? I literally put this on first ~to get my eyes de-puffed as I figure out what I am wearing etc. It’s so cheap & functional I am glad this exists. By the time I get any semblance of a basic face done, my eye have no bags.",1.0
Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and at the end of the day dissolves my makeup beautifully as the first part of my two step makeup removal process. Will definitely repurchase.,1.0
"Absolutely moisturizing, leaving my face feeling so nice and lasts all day. Love, love, love",1.0
"I absolutely love this mask! I do prefer it as a 20-30 min mask rather than overnight, because it is a little thick and my pores do clog easily. I like to use this after I first use a deeper pore cleansing mask, like a charcoal one. Super hydrating and my skin feels plump and fresh afterwards. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1.0
"I’ve been using this face wash for a few years now. It’s my absolute favorite, I use it twice a day now. I’ve tried it all, and this one was a miracle to my skin routine. I definitely need to use other products with this, but it’s worth it if you’re willing to commit to the routine!",1.0
"This comes in a super cute packaging that slides open as well as the moisturizer jar is cute. I used this under makeup on traditionally dry skin. It goes on smooth, moisturizes well without being greasy and has a nice fragrance",1.0
"This is one of the nicest sunscreens I’ve ever used. I live in sunny Florida, so I’m always lathering up in SPF. Since the pandemic, I’ve been walking outside a lot more, so this is much needed. I adore the consistency because it feels like a moisturizer and doesn’t leave any white cast residue. No greasy feeling, it just melts into my skin. Has a beautiful tropical scent. Its lightweight, perfect for everyday wear. It has a peachy color that blends in with your skin tone. It has a thinner consistency, so be sure to shake the bottle well before use. My skin looks and feels so hydrated after using. Free of phthalates, oxybenzone, and hydroquinone. It has: HeatForce Technology - the SPF contains a heat-sensing essence in the cream which is activated by heat. WetForce Technology - Negative ions in the formula combine with positive ions in your sweat to create an additional layer of invisible sun protection",1.0
leaves face feeling super clean,1.0
I got this as a free sample and I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked just after one use! My skin is baby soft and it didn’t make me feel oily after applying! Will be buying the full size when I can afford it.,1.0
"I received this product to try in exchange for an honest review.Estee Lauder is a very well known, quality brand. Box is sleek and clean in appearance.  Power cream is thick in consistency. A little goes a Long way! I am able to cover entire face and neck with 2 small dabs. It is Lightly scented.",1.0
Obsessed with this mask!! I got it in one of my Influenster Voxboxes and was so excited. My skin felt amazing after!,1.0
I absolutely love this toner. Also it’s Bipoc brand so that’s a bonus!,1.0

"I’ve been wanting to try this product because I’ve heard good things! i really like how clean and fresh this product makes my skin feel without all the fragrances, and silly extra stuff. I love how simple this product is, but how it does so well with my skin! I’m glad i got this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling!",1.0
"I broke out so bad after using it, like painful acne all over my cheeks. I took a break from it and used other exfoliants and when I went back to it, same thing. I’m not really acne prone so it was weird.",0.0
"Great facial oil, and a little goes a really long way",1.0
Great and melting my makeup and it smells so amazing! Just like cherry candy or cherry yogurt!,1.0
"Bought this because I have the non-matte version and even in my mid-30’s, still get oily by mid day. Didn’t reduce the shine at all. Still like the color and the SPF but didn’t do trick for me.",0.0
"I love this product! I got it for Christmas with the Cleanser as well in the gift set they had. I have really sensitive skin and recent I have gone through a really rough patch of cystic hormonal acne leaving me with scaring. I have attached photos from before and after. This is March 4, 2022 to May 9 2022. I have not used these daily since March but I have used them daily for the past 2 weeks! Totally recommend even for sensitive skin!!!",1.0
This product has been game changing for me so far. If only it weren’t so expensive :(,1.0
"I got a sample of this with my Sephora purchase so I only used it once, and I was pretty underwhelmed. It felt like I had just taken some baking soda, mixed it with water, and used it as a scrub. As I tried to spread it across my face it pulled and bunched up, not easy to spread. So I was unimpressed with the texture but beyond that, I also found how gritty it was to be a little irritating on my skin too! It gets two stars because there was no discernable scent, which I like, and because I guess it did exfoliate my face, so it does what it says.",0.0
"I received this product from friend as a gift. I got a trial size product kit of Squalane + Vitamin C Rose oil and lactic acid night resurfacing serum. I must say, this oil smells amazing and heavenly. The consistency of this oil is very light and it sips in skin so well. It leaves a positive shine on face after applying this oil. Lastly, a little bit goes a long way. I just wish they decrease the price of this product.",1.0
"If you are done dealing with tired looking eyes, this product is for you. It instantly reduces puffiness and dark circles, giving me a brighter, refined look. It has great ingredients that smooth the eye area. Complimentary from Sunday Riley.",1.0

"Love this stuff. Leaves my lips feeling supple and soft. I get cold sores fairly frequently (4-6x/yr), and with frequent use, I haven’t had a single one. Originally purchased 8 months ago and after daily use (and sharing w my bf who also loves it), it’s still 50% full.",1.0
My skin feels shiny and so healthy. Would definitely recommend,1.0
"I had really high hopes about this product and bought it before sampling. It smells amazing and feels nice to the touch but it was not good for my acne. It stung a bit when I first applied it which should have been enough of a sign but I persevered. After like half an hr i had to wash it off. It made my acne feel and look much worse, but it did look good under makeup where I don’t have acne. I might use it just in my t-zone but overall won’t purchase again.",0.0
I was so excited when I saw they had a new gummy bear flavor but really disappointed when I tried it and it just smells like grape! This should have been flavored grape and had a different scent for gummy bear!,0.0
This is not worth the hype but not a terrible product either. I used it last night and had to reapply again before bed. It reminds me of a lip balm that you would purchase from the store/beauty supply. I was so excited for this product but upon receiving it am disappointed. I will stick with my Jouer lip balm.,0.0
Perfect summer moisturizer! Wake up having super soft skin! Love it.,1.0
"Okay, I waited a whole month to try this peel out because I’m so used to my own peel and trusting towards it but WOW. This peel made my skin feel amazing. When I buy more peel products in the future I’ll definitely try this again. It left my skin feeling so fresh in the morning",1.0
Greasy and made my skin more dry than it’s ever been! Felt like those chapsticks that constantly have you reapplying.,0.0
"I really liked this product, I received it complimentary for my honest review. It was a very very small sample size and I’m not sure if my skin was super dehydrated because I had to use a lot to fully moisturize my face. The product is awesome. It’s clean doesn’t leave a sticky feeling at all. Smell is light and airy. I just would need a way bigger container if I was going to use this twice a day.",1.0
"Does what it describes! I wish the scent was more coconut, but over-all, good product!",1.0
I have the Vanilla one and I LOVE it. I wear it every night and my lips feel great in the morning. I took off one star because I also have the Sweet Candy one and I hate it. It actually dries my lips more. I don’t know why that is.,1.0
"I have been searching for the right skincare for my aging dry skin. This, coupled with the plum plump moisturizer is a must have combo. My skin looks youthful, glowy (but not shiny) and is the perfect base before applying my makeup.",1.0
It’s alright but it’s definitely not one step. I use toner afterward and still need to use 1-2 pads to fully get my make up off.Does make my skin soft though,1.0
"I really love this product! First of all, the smell alone makes you feel like you’re in an orange dream. Second of all, it’s light weight but still provides the hydration you want and need! Which is super important in regards to clogged pores. I received this item complimentary but definitely think it’s worth paying for. I received this product complimentary for review purposes but my personal opinion is that this is one of the best items out there.",1.0
"LOVE Tatcha but not sure about this one...kinda smells like antibacterial hand soap from a public restroom. The spray is awkward too, left droplets on my face. Didn’t provide much “dew”. For the price I’d say it’s mediocre. Only impressive thing was the beautiful packaging in which the bottle is glass & feels luxurious.",0.0
I love this product. My skin has gotten much dryer with age and soap based products just don’t work for me. I use this at night and wipe off with a face wipe. My skin feels clean but not dry. It doesn’t take a lot so a jar lasts quite a while.,1.0
literally does nothing. my natural skin tone is the lightest shade of any base product and even the dark version of these drops was barely noticeable. tan luxe works way better,0.0
"I have pretty dry skin especially in the winter (Winnipeg, MB), and this oil has saved my skin. Its moisturizing but does not clog your pores. You don’t need a lot to cover your whole face, maybe 2-3 drops. Can be used as a replacement for eye cream as well. Love It, literally can’t function without it.",1.0
It pills and I really don’t like that but it works and its so inexpensive that it makes it worth it.,1.0
"I’m honestly shocked how great my face felt after using. I’ve tried many other oil based makeup removers and they all seem to still leave touches of makeup where I would have to double wash with a cleanser after. This is the holy grail. I’m truly blown away with how clean and fresh my face felt, so clean where I wouldn’t even have to wash with a cleanser after.",1.0
"I live in an extremely cold and dry climate.  This is perfect as a second moisturizer, or underneath makeup. Smells amazing and a tiny bit goes a long way!",1.0
I have used this product in the past but didn’t like the dropper aspect of it so I switched. I was so excited to see that they switched to a pump and knew it was going to be a staple for me once again. The formula is amazing soaks right in and gives my skin a brighter appearance. I have sensitive skin and this vegan formula has not caused any irritation. I was gifted by Algenist.,1.0
"This cream was gifted by Skinfix. I love two things about thus cream- FIRST- it’s so smoothing! I truly feel like my skin is softened immediately after using it, but it doesn’t feel heavy or slimy, like a lot of emollient creams can. It feels really gentle on my skin! It doesn’t smell or have any lingering fragrance and I really appreciate that- it’s so much gentler for my skin! The other thing I really love is this genius applicator- I love that you get a precise amount each time so you don’t overuse it and get EXACTLY what you need- this wonderful cream will last a while to keep my skin looking lovely :)",1.0
"I bought a belif kit and this eye cream came in it. I was so excited to try it since I love belif! I started using it and my under eye area felt super hydrated immediately! However, after a few weeks of using this product, I noticed I have developed more fine lines than I had before. I am extremely disappointed since I use other belif products and have no issues. I had very few fine lines prior to this product and now I have a ton. Would not recommend this product to anyone! :(",0.0
"it’s a great lip balm, has a nice smooth feel and it’s almost like gloss but not sticky or too shiny. I have this one and the peach one and i like them both. Only giving 4 stars because k-beauty websites sell them about $5-6 cheaper.",1.0
I honestly did not think I would love this as much as I do! I see an immediate glow right after it sets. My skin looks healthy and smooth! I pour the product in my hand and pat on my face. I thought the formula was going to be one of those sticky toners but it’s not. I am pleasantly surprised. And I don’t mind the light scent.,1.0
I love this for the extra boost of moisture I need in the winter! When I use this before bed I always wake up in the morning with refreshed skin!,1.0
"Although there’s a lot of hype behind this mask, and it smells nice, if you have sensitive skin I would be cautious. I tried the sample and liked how moisturizing it was and bought the full-size. However, now that I’m using this more often, my face gets red and hot in places. This also happens with my mom. Unfortunately I threw out the packaging so I can’t return it, I guess I’ll just use it for my neck or something.",0.0
I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin/scarring on my skin since using this product for the past 2 months!,1.0

"About the same cost as Neutrogena wipes but smells better, takes off more makeup and is much more gentle on my skin. I’ll be telling all of my friends.",1.0
"This is a nice moisturizer, but a little overpriced for what it offers. It isn’t super hydrating; I typically apply it underneath my regular moisturizer before makeup. I have to use several pumps to get enough product to cover my face adequately. It does feel nice on the skin, doesn’t pill under makeup, etc. it’s solid but maybe not worth the $$.",0.0
"A bit overpriced for what it is. Ingredients aren’t anything particular “luxury“ or “expensive“ from what I can see. Feels just like a really rich moisturizer, which is what I use it as before bed. Wouldn’t repurchase it mainly because of the price, but it does make my skin feel supple.",0.0
"This works like a standard moisturizing cream; I can’t say anything in the formula stood out to me as being worth the price. I don’t have anything negative to say, since it does its job. However, if you’re on the fence, I’d go with the smallest size instead to try it out before committing.",1.0
"Smells good, feels good on your lips, but isn’t miraculous. It’s basically like a pretty, non-sticky lip balm. Doesn’t last until morning for me (lasts about as long as other lip balms basically) but makes my lips look pretty. I didn’t have high expectations for this as a mask just wanted something a bit more substantial to put on my lips for overnight use.",1.0
"This review applies to my fellow dry, dehydrated, sensitive skin people! If this is you, read on; acne-prone, oily skin readers I am not the best resource. So, I am a big fan of Tatcha products. I love the Camelia Cleansing Oil as well as the Dewy Skin Mist. However, this product really does not do much for me. I stuck with it and used the whole bottle, hoping that I would see better results, but overall I can say that it doesn’t do exactly what it claims to (at least on my skin type.) I was hoping to see softer, plumper skin, especially for the price, but I truly didn’t notice a difference. It felt as though I was simply patting water into my skin. Perhaps it works better on other skin types, but for those looking for ammo in the battle against dull, dehydrated skin, I would keep looking. Three stars are awarded for not irritating my sensitivity-prone skin, the size of the product, and for being a clean beauty product.",0.0
"This eye serum is unreal, it is by far the most effective eye serum I have ever used. My main concerns are dark circles, dryness, and wrinkle prevention and after using it every night for a week, I´ve already noticed improvements. The next morning the skin around my eyes feels extremely moisturized, nourished, in some way awakened, bright, and without puffy eyes! Love the applicator, is easy, cooling and you can control exactly the amount you need. The texture is divine, so buttery yet lightweight, really nourishing, and not at all heavy, skins into the skin effortlessly leaving it smooth and soft. Indeed, retinoids, niacinamide, ceramides, and centella asiatica create a powerhouse team !! I was a little nervous about using retinoids every night because the skin beneath my eyes is really sensitive but this is a gentle yet effective eye serum from which I haven’t experience any irritation at all. I’m eager to see the long-term results and for sure this eye serum got a special place on my shelf.",1.0
This is great for dry skin. It’s soothing and doesn’t break me out. I definitely recommend for winter months.,1.0
"I live in Michigan and stuffer from eczema and very dry skin. I love this moisturizer, it really helped my flakey skin in my forehead, it didn’t seem to cause my eczema to flair.  It did however make my face breakout.  It really makes me sad because it worked so well on my forehead, but broke out the rest of my face.  It doesn’t have a smell, my skin just might be too sensitive for this.",1.0
I loved it ! It leaves a tiny on your lips and it’s very moisturizing compared to anything I’ve tried so far ! I struggle with very dry lips naturally and this definitely feels like it’s made a change ! It was gifted by Fresh to me and I’m already looking to buying a second one,1.0
I love this face oil. It glides on and deeply moisturizes the skin. Is not greasy and has a mild yet pleasant smell.,1.0
"When I ordered it I was skeptical because my skin is so sensitive and reactive and I can’t use many products made for acne or imperfections. My skin is dehydrated but a little oily at some places. At first, I put it only on my oil spots to be sure it wasn’t to harsh for me. After a few days I applied it everywhere, my skin reacted a little red and felt different but it was not stinging or hurting. I continued using it morning and night every day. I observed my skin becoming so much better! Less bumps on my forehead, less blackheads and pimples coming out of nowhere. My skin became way more balanced! It never dried my skin or break me out. I am using it since a few months now on oily patches and my skin is way better than ever. It is awesome for sensitive skin but I think it should NOT be used with an other product made to clear acne other than a spot treatment (otherwise it would be to harsh for sensitive skin). I also observed the product was peeling easily with other products while applying it. Personally, I put some on, I massage a little, when I see it seems to start peeling I stop massaging and let it be absorbed by skin (the texture is perfect for it to stay in place). I don’t think it would be effective as much if it is only used as a spot treatment on pimples. I think the secret is in consistency and for a long term use to see improvement on skin.For imperfections, pimples, blackheads and large clogged pores use it with “Buffet” from the same brand it is INCREDIBLY effective.Thank me later!",1.0
Absolutely love this cleanser. The first cleanser I’ve used that actually feels like it’s doing something without drying out my face. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and happy! Most cleansers feel like they’re drying and leave my skin feeling rough and itchy. This stuff is perfect. AND it’s a clean product!,1.0
I received this item complimentary to test and review.  I love the floral scent and the way this makes my skin feel.  It leaves my face feeling silky smooth.  I have very sensitive skin and didn’t experience any side effects from this product.,1.0
"I received this complimentary from Influenster. This serum first of all, smells amazing. It’s easy to apply, and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. I apply it on fresh clean skin before my moisturizer. My face appears to be brighter over using it for the last few weeks. I would definitely recommend it to someone. However, it is fairly pricy.",1.0
Got this as a dark spot remover. It didn’t do anything for my dark spot. But my skin feels nice.,1.0
I am always looking for any skincare products with hyaluronic acid in it because my skin is so dry and nothing else seems to hydrate my skin! Let me just say this glow recipe hyaluronic cream is lightweight yet VERY effective! I love that I can put this under my makeup and have the most perfect glow without feeling too greasy. The smell is divine and I love all the different hydrating ingredients this cream has!,1.0
"This cream is soooo nice! I bought it because my face gets really dry in the winter and I spend a lot of time outside. It definitely works for thirsty skin. I can slightly feel it on my face even an hour later but it’s just  a bit tacky, not greasy. Those with oily or combo skin may not like it. I haven’t tried it under makeup yet but I’m optimistic.",1.0
Love the scent and moisturizing power,1.0
I’m reading all the sensitive skin reviews and I’m surprised to say I didn’t have any problems even having extremely sensitive skin myself. Everyone’s skin is different and this happened to work for me! My only downside to this is that I would absolutely not wear this all night long. Maybe at the most an hour. That’s too much For me. I can see how keeping it on overnight would hurt the skin.,1.0
The absolute BEST moisturizers that I have EVER put on my face!!,1.0
"dried my lips out sooooooo bad. literally were cracked, peeling, and bleeding. I stopped using it and it got better. def do not recommend buying this",0.0
"Loving this moisturizer. I traveled to Brazil which was super hot and this moisturizer wasn’t too heavy on my face, used it twice a day.",1.0
Very good product for breaking down light or heavy makeup. Way better than using a makeup wipe. This is also made so you can use it as a moisturizing mask. It is super thick and moisturizing and not like a regular cleanser.,1.0
"This stuff is amazing! I use this on days when I have a full heavy face of makeup and this is the only product I’ve ever tried that completely takes off everything including waterproof mascara. I rinse it off and finish with a Murad cleanser but this is a must have for late nights when you need something quick. It also softens my skin but despite the thick, oily-ish consistency, doesn’t leave my skin oily whatsoever and I have very oily skin. Can’t recommend this enough!",1.0
I loveee this product! I am not usually a fan of gel-based products but this one was a really pleasant surprise. Left my skin feeling really hydrated and not heavy! It also has a great scent which is always a nice bonus!,1.0
"I received this product for free for testing purposes and love it! It does not leave your face sticky like other serums. Also, it has little to no scent which I also really enjoy. Usually scented product make my eyes water or the scent lingers on me all day. My skin has definitely felt a lot more smooth and looked more radiant. I recommend this product!",1.0
"I love this! I was a bit skeptical in thinking they would make any difference on my face but I am always hopeful with each new product I try. This one made a difference. I am 58 years old and the skin is starting to look aged - larger pores, skin tone is uneven, and I thought pimples were supposed to be gone after I passed my teenage years. My skin’s texture, brightness, pore size is so much better, noticeably better. My skin looks and feels awesome! My makeup is easier to apply and looks great.I will absolutely be buying them again.",1.0
"I’ve tried liking this. It pills after wearing it for an hour. I’ve tried it by itself, after serums, before make up and I get the same result. Feels rough after wearing for a while, doesn’t absorb fully, and if I tough my face it comes right off. Huge disappointment",0.0
"Great cream even for my oily skin. I use it at night and it makes my skin super soft. For someone who has dry or combination skin, this would be a nice hydrating moisturizer that improves the look of the skin after time. I would definitely recommend this cream even with the high price point.",1.0
"Unfortunately the positive reviews influenced my purchasing of this product. I have to say that the consistency is very thick. So thick to the point where you feel it stiffen on your skin as it “soaks“ in. I went onto the CosDNA website, and it turns out this product contains hydrogenated vegetable oil. On the acne potential scale, it’s at a 3! Any product that lands between 3 and 5 is more likely to clog your pores! I noticed my cheek acne and scarring has not improved and has in fact gotten worse. It’s really unfortunate. I wouldn’t recommend this product to those who are acne-prone.",0.0
Makes my face feel refreshed! I love it and always use it twice a day!,1.0
"The texture was thicker than I expected but still absorbed quickly and it did not leave a sticky residue. A little bit of this product goes a long way, which is great because it really can be used everywhere!",1.0
I haven’t seen much of a difference so far because it’s pretty new . But i can say that the cream is very moisturizing.  I also have very sensitive skin and so far so good,1.0
"I always buy this and it never let’s me down. Great for all over face, including eyes! Seriously, it works and it’s way better for the environment. Plus, it leaves my skin soft after (still hydrate).",1.0
"I returned it. Not a fan, did not correct any of my redness.",0.0
I love this moisturizer because I don’t have to use a ton of product to get the look I want! This product is amazing for my skin especially in the winter!,1.0
"I received a free sample of this product and am really enjoying it. I love the way it smells, and the way it feels when you put it on. You don’t need much at all, and a little goes a long way. It makes my face feel so moisturized. The only downside I have found with this product is that it makes my face look very oily the next day. So I have to wash it twice usually to make sure that I got most of the product off so my face doesn’t look like a giant grease mess by the end of the day.",1.0
"I have mixed skin.  I didn’t think this would work so well for me, but I started seeing results from the first week of application.  My skin was very messy in this quarantine, due to stress and the truth that I have improved a lot.  my pores look cleaner and serrated.",1.0
"I sampled this moisturizer out of curiosity and was amazed immediately after putting it on for the first time. I was immediately hooked and have now been using it for 6+ months! I have oily/combo skin so any “deep moisture“ products tend to scare me away because looking like an oil slick is not my jam, but this moisturizer truly feels like it’s sinking in and hydrating my face. I’ve used lots of moisturizers that feel like they sit on the surface and don’t do anything, but man, this one actually feels nourishing! It’s SO good and even though I love trying new products occasionally, this one is a permanent fixture in my routine. I use it at night, but it’s balanced enough for daytime use too!",1.0
"I love this serum. Super Hydrating. Goes great under makeup or just alone. Wish they skipped on the fragrance though, I don’t need any smell on my face, but it goes away after applying. Overall would totally recommend it.",1.0
"I was skeptical because I read the bad reviews, but it really does go on clear. Obviously I have to reapply throughout the day. I can’t expect it to work all day after one application. I wish it was cheaper but if I have to spend the money on it, I will.",1.0
"when i got this i really wasn’t expecting much since i’ve never had much luck but i have never loved my lips more!! since using this i’ve noticed that my lips are actually filled in quite nicely and that they also have a healthy rosy tone! i use this religiously every night, and anytime i take a nap. you could use this as a regular lipgloss but it’s a bit heavy. when i used to use chapstick alone my lips still became dry within 15 minutes of applying and my lipstick would always gather in my creases or only stick to certain parts of my lips (and that’s with regular exfoliation!) but now everything glides on like a dream and stays!! i got the trial size and even though i slather it on daily, it’s lasted me three weeks so far and i probably have two more months left!!",1.0
"Starting to love this stuff! Very convenient. I am pale/dry skin and got medium bc I thought light would be too light bc you never know, either way you can adjust the deepness of your tan! After my 2nd time using this I think I have perfected it. I would recommend a thicker moisturizer (I use vanicream). Exfoliate and moisturize after shower makes a difference. Then I used 1 pump of lotion per area on body. 3 drops per area for light tan, 5 for medium and 5+ for deep. If tan isn’t deep enough doing it again next day will not ruin it. Definitely wash your hands good at least 3 times during application...1st after legs/feet, 2nd middle body and 3rd arms/face, then use left over on hands and wash palms only. 1-2 drops only for face/ears...Slight tan smell, very moisturizing, blendable...Hope this helps!! :)",1.0
"I’ve been looking for a luscious cream to help my dry/healing skin. My acne was really bad last year and after taking medication for it, following that up with this cream has been amazing. Super hydrating and my skin looks sooo much better. I previously got a sample of the gel moisturizer but decided to go with the crème because I felt the gel didn’t go as far and I still needed to reapply it afterwards.",1.0
"Very nice, non greasy, texture quite light. But quite expensive almost $100 for only 30ml",1.0
"Honestly this gets ALL my makeup off. Ya girl wants a bold red lip with smashbox liquid lip? It gets it off. Even gets off my eyelash glue!!!! What?! And it’s clean! I still use a cleansing soap after to make sure my pores are clean, but it really does an awesome job!",1.0
"I received the Lancome Hydra Zen Anti Stress Glow Liquid Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I. AM. IN. LOVE.  I was a little hesitant to try it at first due to the floral scent, but it is not bothersome, at all.  It is an extremely light scent and more on the ‘fresh’ side than floral.  The moisturizer is extremely lightweight and is the perfect base for any type of foundation you desire (I have days that I wear a CC cream and other days that I wear a heavier foundation).  I have been using this product for about two weeks so far and I have noticed an overall improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is perfect for me and I have had no breakouts or other side effects. I 10/10 recommend this product and will be purchasing in the future.",1.0
I have eczema and this is the only primer I found that works for me,1.0
I want to start of by saying I got it for free via Influenster and I wanted to love the product but couldn’t. I used it for about a week and once I stopped applying the product my skin became very dry it was bad something that had never happened to my face before. For a $100 I don’t expect for it to dry my skin horribly bad when I stop using the product not sure I would invest in it.,0.0
"I love this cleanser so much! Even though it is more for normal-oily skin, I have dry skin and it still works so well for me. I love using this as a second cleanse because it gets all the dirt (not makeup) off my face easily while gently exfoliating. I also love this because a little goes a long way, and you get 5oz of product which is huge so this lasts a really long time. You should definitely go buy this you won’t regret it!!",1.0
I have been using this product for the whole 2020. It’s mild but washes my face well at the same time. Very affordable too. My skin condition is stable using this. Like it!,1.0
"I have tried every acne cleanser, from drugstore to high end. I’ve used multiple serums and masks and nothing could get rid of my acne or my acne scars. I realized my skin needs good exfoliation to help get rid of the dirt and also stop my acne from leaving any scars. I don’t even pick or pop my pimples and yet they would still linger for weeks and leave a flat, red little mark on my skin. I use the tata and dermalogica acne cleanser in the morning but only this at night to wash away all the dirt from the day and then just pat my face to dry. I don’t add any serums or any other nonsense and my skin in the morning has become so fresh, clear and plump I have never in my life had such little acne before and I have been struggling with acne for 10 years now!!!! I know everyone’s skin is different but I chose this cleanser/exfoliator out of all the ones sephora offers, including ones with better reviews that I’ve sampled and this one by far is pure perfection",1.0
"Firstly, love the product. Removes all makeup, including mascara. Leaves my skin soft, no lotion needed. I use these when I’m too lazy to wash my face over the sink., a couple nights a week. Next time I’m buying the full size. The mini not only comes with less, but the actual towelettes are tiny. Good for travel or throwing in your gym bag. The coconut doesn’t actually smell like coconut, it’s a light fresh scent.",1.0
"This product is strong for me because I have sensitive skin, but I do appreciate a quality product like this.",1.0
I had baggy dark circles under my eyes.  From the 1st time I used the product I could see a noticeable improvement. Honestly I could actually feel the product working. Definitely a fan!,1.0
"I was super excited to try this peel! I’ve used other peels and have always loved how glowy and smooth my face is afterwards. I wanted to love this so much but unfortunately my skin has been a little overly sensitive and when I used the peel my face ended up having a minor allergic reaction the next day. I did the skin test before with no problems but my face reacts differently to some products. It was super easy to use, clean face and wipe down with the cloth, wash off the next day. Wish it would have worked out better!",1.0
"I’ve tried multiple face cleansers but I always come back to this one. Its affordable and does a great job, and I have sensitive and combination skin.",1.0
"I’ve been using this serum for about 2 months. I like it a lot! It is light when I apply it on my face, and it makes my skin softer. I see it’s anti-age effect, the skin is smooth and well moisturized.",1.0
"This moisturizer has a nice and refreshing rose scent but the smell is faint after application (which is a plus because I am not normally a fan of scented products on my face). The cream is very hydrating and not heavy. It makes my face feel very soft, soothing. I have now added this product to my skincare routine and would highly recommend.",1.0
"I purchased this on a whim and I’m honestly so happy that I did. It’s been a little over 2 weeks and I’ve already noticed a difference! My skins pretty sensitive and this doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I also have really dry skin and this stuff is super hydrating - one pump is definitely enough. A lot of my redness has reduced substantially, my skin generally looks brighter and my texture has improved. On top of that, some of my scarring from acne has disappeared/faded too....after 2 weeks!!! I think I’m in love with this product and I will definitely purchase again, highly recommend!",1.0
"This is one of the cleansers in my rotation and while I like it, I probably won’t repurchase. I like the scent and the packaging, but it does make my skin feel a little tight. The biggest issue is the price. If I’m going to spend this much for a cleanser, it really needs to blow me away and this one didn’t.",0.0
I received a complementary sample from influencer. And I really like this product and that keeps my skin moisturize  and it is too early to see if it minimize pores.,1.0
"I work outside all year and it takes a toll on my skin. Since using this product I have seen a big improvement, I’m on my second bottle and will be repurchasing again.",1.0
Really disappointed in this—didn’t see or feel much of a difference in my skin using this. Surprised because I love al the other DE products I’ve tried. Just felt drying.,0.0
"Love this, it shines on my lips and makes them feel amazing! I enjoy wearing this everyday and even to bed, when I wake up my lips are moisturizered instead of dry! My only pet peeve is it doesn’t absorb as well as I would like it to, it kind of just lingers on my lips all day so at least I don’t have to reapply until night time!!!",1.0
"I took this on a beach holiday with me and it worked sooo well that I never had to put foundation on, for the first time ever on a trip (and I always wear foundation!). I used it as my base and then put bronze/blush and viola, perfect dewy glowing skin :) LOVE!!!",1.0
"I am a softball college coach! I am outdoors constantly so hydrating my lips are a “must“ for me!!I was so excited to buy this product because I heard so much about it. To be honest with you, I have been using bag balm as my chapstick in the last 2 years bc its the only thing thats helped my lips stay hydrated up to 24 hours without reapplying. I put the tatcha the kissu lip mask on my lips for a few nights.. my lips werent as soft or hydrated as i thought they would be with this $28 product. I didnt get much of a scent either.I will not be repurchasing. I will stick with my $6 bag balm that I can get at a local store.",0.0
This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  It goes on velvety soft and is truly invisible.  It even cut down on the shine left by my moisturizer underneath!  I would give this a perfect 5 stars if only it came in a bigger size for this price.,1.0
I received this complimentary through an Influenster voxbox. This serum has helped tremendously with my marks left from accutane. I think it has helped more than my retinol has. It is pretty dang pricy but if you’re on the fence about it I definitely recommend it! Your face will thank you a thousand times!,1.0
"It feels nice, absorbs well, and doesn’t feel greasy. I’ve noticed a slight difference with the pigment under my eyes, but no difference in the puffiness however I often don’t have very puffy eyes. I think it works well, but there are other options out there for less who work the same.",1.0
This product is amazing. I have VERY sensitive eyes and was worried at first due to the smell and rich texture. I have had no problems with eye sensitivity JUST results! I have been able to go out without makeup on after just 2 days of use! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1.0
"Loved the texture of this product, but I felt it did nothing for my skin",0.0
"This was gifted by dermalogical. It’s a very tough scrub, so perfect for getting rid of the junk in our face. However, it’s made to be used everyday, which can work as your daily cleanser. I recommend it!",1.0
"Love it! Used properly, and my skin has never been so smooth and clear!",1.0
"This toner is so gentle and so effective. I’ve been breaking out so bad lately(don’t really know why) and in only 2 days I’ve noticed a difference. No new breakouts and the ones I already had have gone down so fast. I never leave reviews but thought this product is actually worth it. Plus, the prize is great for such a potent product.",1.0
This product is buttery and smooth. It has just the right amount of tint. It’s perfect for a cute natural look or as a lipstick topper.,1.0
"This was a free sample that gave my face a smooth, clean feeling.",1.0
I received this from Influenster for my honest review. This product is so good if you have damaged skin from acne or acne in general! I have recently had a major breakout when I never had them before and this helped even it out by a lot. I use it as spot treatment and then all over to even it out. Highly recommend!,1.0
"Previously used Neutrogena wipes to remove my makeup, but switched to this because I’ve always heard double cleansing is better. I’ve used micellar water which made my eyelids red and puffy. This removes my makeup so well (I use concealer and tons of mascara) and makes my skin super smooth. I am so glad I switched. :)",1.0
"I sometimes get eczema of my lips when I get really stressed, but usually have dry lips because I don’t drink enough water. I use this nightly and it really helps. I am of course working on improving the stress and drinking more water part, but glad I’m not suffering as much as I would be without this mask.",1.0
Got it as a sample size and I fell in love. It’s lightweight which is great for my combo/oily skin and it is not oily! I recommend!,1.0
This is the best lip treatment on the market! I️ used to use the First Aid beauty lip treatment and also the Bite beauty shave lip mask. They don’t even come close to this one! Great for the colder weather months ahead!,1.0
I’ve only used this product one time. It is a product that I’ve been wanting to try for a while now. I’ve finally got the chance and it did not disappoint. This balm breaks through the makeup without drying out your skin. A little goes a long way. If you wear makeup you’ll love this!! Go ahead and add it to your makeup removal routine.,1.0
"I use this on dry skin as the first step of my double cleanse. I love knowing it’s “clean“ and it seems to really remove all my makeup and sunscreen while still being gentle and not breaking me out. I keep repurchasing over and over and would definitely consider this a staple in my routine. *TIP: if you are struggling to remove your eye makeup, after you apply dry and gently rub to “loosen“ everything up, add a little water to fingertips and gently rub in circles.",1.0
"My go-to cream for day and night.  I live in Los Angeles where the air is very dry and needed something that would provide the utmost moisture without any shine. This product meets the mark! I’ve gone through half the jar and I will be re-purchasing.   It feels light, and works great under foundation as well.   I also have super sensitive skin that’s prone to redness, and I’ve noticed after using this cream my skin looks less red.   I also feel moisturized all day long.  Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed!",1.0
"I used my points to get a sample of this to try...and am I ever glad I did. My skin has a lot of pink undertone to it and this color corrects it so beautifully. It’s lovely on the skin - not heavy at all. Smells nice, feels nice and looks terrific. Right after trying the sample a few times, I ordered the large jar. This is definitely part of my new daily routine.",1.0
The best face cream I’ve ever have! My skin got so much better. LOVE THIS.,1.0
I got the rose one. I love the smell and it worked well for me (I don’t use a lot of makeup on my face). I will be buying again,1.0
This stuff is like magic and it smells amazing. My skin could instantly tell the difference and I could see a major difference in my skin it kept it hydrated all day being that its winter my skin gets really dry and chapped not with this thing is kep my skin feeling good not dry I’ve already purchased some for family,1.0
"I typically only use R+F Unblemished but gave this a try. It actually is a very mild and calming cleanser. I liked how gentle it was on my skin but because I do air more on the side of oily, I did notice some odd dry patches on my forehead (not too noticeable) and my oil was not well controlled. My face felt very clean after showers though. Additionally, it has a very organic almost grassy scent. I’m not personally a fan of it but it does make it feel more fresh so that might appeal to others. Overall, I would recommend this product to those with more of a dry-combo skin type. It did a great job of making my face feel clean and removing all of my face make up. Also I like how a little bit goes a long way, making this worth the price even more.",1.0
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes only from Influenster however, that will not deter me from giving my honest opinion on the product.  I have normal to dry skin and I am always looking out for hydrating cleansers.  This one in particular though did not give me that.  I didn’t feel or see anything different in my skin.  It didn’t give me enough hydration, my skin felt stripped after using it and it was abrasive on my skin.  The consistency is like a creamy grainy texture.  It took quite the effort to rinse off because of that, which I did not enjoy.  I suggest using a pea size amount because a little goes a very long way, plus if you use a lot then it’ll take a lot of effort to rinse off.  I expected a lot more from this product since it’s high end and Tatcha but it just wasn’t it for me.  I’ve had better results with a basic cleanser from the drug store.  I was a little bit disappointed with this product and I won’t be purchasing it after I run out.  The only plus was the nice sleek packaging and the creamy texture which is different to any other cleansers but other than that it’s a no from me.",0.0
This product was sent by Supergoop for review purposes only. I really liked the natural finish of this sunscreen tint. It definitely gives a nice glow without leaving the skin greasy. It applied pretty easy too!,1.0
"I like the convenience of the stick, and the formula seems to work well, at least during winter. Summer sun is different, and I hope I still like it then. I like that the brand is safe, and the smell doesn’t bother me like a lot of sunscreens.",1.0
"I received this free from Influenster for review. I didn’t love the smell and it didn’t feel overly moisturizing on my skin. I am super dry and especially in the winter I need something heavy duty. I probably wouldn’t buy again, but it might work better on someone with combinations skin.",0.0
"My go to moisturizer, if you break out easily this product is for you",1.0
This is a great affordable moisturizer. I have dry skin and this work for me in the summer. Paired with oils it could work well for dry skin the the winter. I’d recommend!,1.0
This product is my new holy grail! I have extremely dry skin from after I had my son and it has worked miracles for my dry skin! I received a sample size in turn for my honest review! And it truly will be a new staple in my routine,1.0
Y’all this is my go to! I’ve never heard of this stuff but you its definitely a game changer in my cleansing and hydration routine. I have a very dry t-zone and this stuff has really boosted the way my skin feels. I dont feel like my pores are clogged. I really like this stuff and intend to continue purchasing.,1.0
"I have very dry skin in the winter and since I recieved this product as a sample I been in love with it. It leaves my skin feeling absolutely amazing, moisturize, hydrated and soft. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. Thank you Influenster for the sample.",1.0
I keep this in my skin care fridge because I love the cooling feeling on my skin it keeps my dry skin soft & moisturized. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes,1.0
Worked great for me at first. This is the first product that ever helped me with my whiteheads. My skin got softer & my texture faded a lot. But my skin got used to it very quickly so it hasn’t been working for me anymore.,1.0
The Glow Recipe watermelon glow niacinamide dew drops is a staple in my skin care routine. I love the way it smells and feels on my face. It’s infused with watermelon and has Hyalarounic  acid pore reducing ingredients which work wonders for my large pores. I love using it after getting out of the shower on a damp face. Gifted by Glow Recipe,1.0
I received this product as a free sample from PinchMe and was impressed by the quality,1.0
This mask was very mediocre and only moderately hydrating. There are so many other products in this price range that are more hydrating. I had higher expectations and would skip it and choose a different hydrating mask if I were you.,0.0
I typically have resilient skin that does react poorly to most products when I try them out for the first time but this stuff BURNED my under eyes so badly in less than 24 hours. Ignore all the five star reviews and pay attention to all the recent one stars…prime example of TikTok influencing bad products and all of us falling for it!!!,0.0
I really love this product for my sensitive skin. And you get a lot of product for the price!,1.0
"I swear by this cleanser. It smells good, a little goes a long way, and it does exactly what you expect. It melts away all of your makeup, including waterproof mascara. I can’t recommend it enough. Yes, it can feel slightly greasy, but it rinses off easily and my face feels so clean that I don’t need to use a face wash after it. (I do anyway.)",1.0
This balm is so luxurious! It glides on so well and does a really great job at breaking down my make up so that i can wipe it right off. Its the only way i can avoid raccoon eyes after washing my face! ONLY downside is it does have fragrance in it (which isn’t good for your skin) HOWEVER you are only using it for a minute or so before you wipe it off so i don’t see how it can be irritating like fragrance is in products you leave on the skin. It does smell nice! I have acne prone skin and this does not break me out. I wear make up every day and this has lasted me 3 months. On the fence? Try out the Sephora rewards sample size- enough products for two weeks for 100 pts. Perfect for traveling.,1.0
I have always wanted to try this product as I love the Plum Plump Serum and is my holy grail.  I received it in my Trendmood Vol. 14 Box and it did not disappoint.  My skin is hydrated and plump whenever I use it and would definitely repurchase.  I love that I will only need to purchase the insert as the outer component is reusable.,1.0
Who knew I would love this product and brand as much as I do. It hydrates and gave me a nice glow. I love how it’s blendable. Perfect for daily use.  The Texture is amazing and it makes my skin feel really good.,1.0
This product was great for morning puffiness and tired eyes. I haven’t seen major results in helping with wrinkles as it’s only been one month.,1.0
Wanted to love this so much as I heard amazing things however this broke me out terribly! It’s so thick be warned! I have very clear skin and after one use of this I awake to a bunch of white heads. Had to return.,0.0
"I was selected to try and test out Clarins double serum.I really enjoyed using this product, I used it every morning. I started to notice that my pores were less visible and my face felt a lot tighter. That made me really happy because it was one of my skin concern. The oil smell was great & it was light weight. I feel like it gave me a sunkissed glow which I really liked. It’s a little on the pricy side to be honest but I think it’s worth it if you want to invest in a good product",1.0
"So... I normally use Olay Regenerist products (30 and people think I’m 22, so yay to Olay!) apart from eye creams. Idk why, but my eye region became super dry recently. I needed a super hydrating eye cream. Tried a lot of products. Kiehls creamy avocado eye cream is amazing. Used it for a week and my eyes felt heavenly. The lines that were there are almost gone. Didn’t irritate my eyes, like a lot of eye creams do. Not a perfect solution to all eye area problems, but if your eyes needs some TLC, get this. I didn’t get this for under eye bags, but it definitely helps with puffiness. This is now my go to eye cream.",1.0
I love The Ordinary and have definitely noticed a difference in my skin but I’m not sure this one does much for me. My biggest con about the Hyaluronic Acid + B5 is that it almost always seems to rub and “pill” off my face and neck after I let it dry and apply a moisturizer on top. It’s very sticky and does give me a locked in moisture feel but after that it easily rubs off my face. I’m just not sure if my skin has time to soak it in and reap the benefits of this one. I’m still ganna use it though!,0.0
"This is a non-sensitizing light to mid weight moisturizer.  I have reactive, sensitive skin and I use this daily, including over my T-zone, with only positive results.  I agree with other reviewers that the Adaptogen Cream is quite mild, and I’m not sure it alleviates redness or calms skin per se. Certainly for me, I use it more as a daily light moisturizer.  When I need deep moisturization or when my skin is reactive, I turn to my trusty Cerave moisturizing cream.  I wish YTTP had a deeper moisturizer in their line for those of us who need something with a little more “umph“.  That being said, I am a big fan of this moisturizer, and use it at least once or twice daily. Little discernible scent, mild and soft on your skin, good “slip“ and the jar lasts a long time.  I love that you can trust YTTP to use quality ingredients.  I will definitely repurchase - that is until YTTP comes out with a deeper moisturizer!",1.0
"Product was decent, but a good 2-3 applications spilled out of the bottle during shipping. If I’m paying over $30 a bottle I want to get every single drop of this stuff. I know there has to be a better way to ship this product with out having this issue. I have read many reviews, and this problem seem to happen frequently.",1.0
I am so in love with this product!! I have braces as an adult and they leave my lips so dry and cracked. I use a scrub and apply this product after and it has been a game changer. My lips are smooth and they look fuller and more pink. The product will last forever!! And the little applicator is so fun and makes it feel even more luxurious. I totally recommend this product!!!,1.0
Not a fan of this product it didn’t do much for under my eyes and the stick was very hard to apply. To put it on you have to pull and under eye area your suppose to be gentle. I switched back to my ol banana eye cream and it does wonders!,0.0

"Glow baby GLOW!! I was kindly gifted by Glow Recipe and I’m so thankful I was! I absolutely adore the pink packaging and it’s such a cute bottle! The first time using this, I knew we are soulmates! I don’t wear much makeup so using this at the end of my routine gives me a serious glow from within kind of glow. It’s not glittery or fake. It gives you immediate healthy skin type of glow. It absorbs so quickly and leaves my face hydrated and so soft. I’ve gotten compliments on how I look with just this on my face! I’ve also mixed this into my foundation and it’s the prettiest look ever and it controls my oil production and gives me a longer wear. I’ve also patted this on over shadow for a highlight and on my cheekbones as well! This is truly a multipurpose product that leaves me looking beautiful and good for skin!",1.0
"I started using this moisturizer a few weeks ago. I was definitely skeptical at first, I wasn’t sure how my skin would react to it. I never used anything with Salicylic Acid before. But, my skin started to clear up practically overnight. The smell of the product is light, fresh and very clean, which is nice. It makes my skin feel minty. Although it doesn’t make my skin feel moisturized the way other moisturizers would, it doesn’t completely dry me out so I am overall pleased with the results. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1.0
I’m just in shock. I used it at night and put tretinoin over it and my skin was STILL moisturized in the morning and worked so well with the prescription. It made my skin look like I just got a hydrafacial. I recently got acne for about 2 years now and I have sensitive skin. My pores appeared smaller just from last night and the cream had a nice cooling effect on my skin. It does feel like water when you start rubbing it in but has a good grasp on your skin where it doesn’t feel heavy or gunky. Literally water for your face. Ps. I typically use Drunk Elephant polypeptide moisturizer but I think it stopped affecting my skin. So I decided to switch up and I’m so happy I did. Love both products but I’m in lust rn with tatcha.,1.0
"Love this moisturizer, a little bit on the thicker side but works amazing under makeup and helps conceal flaky, dry skin",1.0
My skin has been feeling the effects of this cold weather and I am thrilled to get my glow back from Biossance! Thanks to their Squalene   Omega Repair Cream my skin feels nourished and rejuvenated without feeling weighed down.  The best part?  The ingredients are non-toxic and they’re saving our planet by using eco-friendly packaging!  I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own.,1.0
I hated this product. It broke my skin out and created texture. It set my skincare progress back drastically. I hated it and what it did to my skin.,0.0
I love the texture of cleansing balms and this is no exception. The texture is so light and airy plus it smells like lime sherbet to me—which I personally love. It’s not a strong or overwhelming scent. I use this when removing make up but I use a general facial cleanser just in the shower or when I am not specifically removing make up. My skin feels clean and supple after washing with this. I’m interested in trying other products from farmacy after trying this because I love it so much. Highly recommend.,1.0
love this cleanser...doesn’t leave your skin dry...even my teen son loves it and he has acne...doesn’t irritate the skin,1.0
"This is a really lightweight and fresh serum. It helped make my face texture even and smooth and bright, but did nothing for my dark spots. I have a lot of freckle-like acne scars and it didn’t make them lighter or smaller. The picture is after using half the bottle morning and night in addition to a retinol. No change in dark marks at all. For the price, I’m sad it didn’t do more.",0.0
"I’ve dealt with hyperpigmentation,  dry uneven skin and the abnormal company had changed my skin for the BETTER. This is my night time toner and I love how it minimizes my pores and makes my skin feel super soft.",1.0
Love that you can customize the color by adding more drops. It mixes well with all of my various moisturizers. It has a light fragrance but the fragrance is pleasant and doesn’t linger. It causes a slight self-tanner odor but anything with DHA will. I like that I can apply a light tan daily or every other day and it looks natural and then doesn’t smell too strong. You do have to make sure to rub it in well to avoid any streaks. Will repurchase.,1.0
"I bought this around February and I use it everyday and I still have so much left for maybe 3 months maybe or 2 . A little bit goes a long way , leaves my face feeling fresh and didn’t make my skin react in a bad way. I looooove it . I have oily skin so I use it maybe 2 times a day and it still last . A must have !",1.0
"Barely can smell any fragrance from it and I’m not very impressed with the results. I was hoping for something delicious and nourishing. It didn’t feel overly nourishing like my Laneige so I returned this.In high temps it didn’t melt out of the container so that was a plus! However, I am not a fan of putting my finger into a lip balm over and over for many months.",0.0
"I really like that this product comes separate in a powder and a liquid to extend the shelf life! Vitamin C as an active is known to go bad relatively quickly, so I think having it separated out is a great idea. This product feels really lightweight. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin yet (as expected), but I’m excited to keep trying this!",1.0
I see and feel a great difference in my skin texture. Great choice,1.0
"I’m somebody with super dry skin, so I usually opt for much heavier moisturizers. However, this product is super lightweight but leaves my skin super hydrated throughout the day. Also, I noticed that the fine lines on my forehead were less apparent after using this moisturizer.",1.0
Smells Great & Leaves You Feeling Clean! I Love All The Healthy Ingredients It Contains! Would Definitely Buy It Again!,1.0
"I was having allergic reactions and break outs to every cream I tried! Even Aveeno! I saw that Jessica Andrea loves the product so decided to give it a try and it is a life changer. This moisturizer is SO light weight, so it doesn’t feel like you are caking on cream. It gives just enough moisture for your skin so there is no oily residue left over. Its been over a year of me using Tatcha’s products and my skin has never been better.",1.0
This is my new favorite product. I love how gentle this is on my sensitive skin. I use it everyday without any problems. I’m looking forward to more products from Tatcha.,1.0
"I bought this at the recommendation of a Sephora employee after I had a bad reaction to too much sun (be careful even when it’s overcast!). It was ok, I wanted something natural and gentle for my sensitive skin. However, it didn’t really do anything for my redness. The price is decent though, I guess. I bought a mini bottle because I was going on a trip and it’s made of glass. I actually dropped it in the shower and it shattered so be careful of that too.",0.0
I received this complimentary from Skinfix.I’ve had to up my skincare game recently because the weather has cooled down and is drying my skin out so bad right now! I added this Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream into my skincare routine the day I received it and have seen a real difference in the last couple of weeks. This creamy texture feels lightweight and hydrating. I also really love this style of push top dispenser. It disperses the perfect amount!,1.0
The scent is phenomenal! Definitely repurchasing this .,1.0
"I received this product as a free sample to review. Because of Goop’s reputation, I knew that it would be good but didn’t know just how good. This peel is as strong and effective as or better than ones I’ve tried at fancy New York City spas. It is a bit pricey but it works! My skin looked so luminous and moisturized the next morning. I definitely recommend it. I",1.0
I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I felt the product didn’t moisturize like I like. It wasn’t heavy feeling just didn’t give me what I need.,0.0
I really wanted to love this. I’ve used other products by the same company without any real results and I was excited to give them another try. Who doesn’t deserve a second chance? However.. This does absolutely nothing for my skin. I was applying it twice a day as told and the only thing it even remotely did for me is make my skin a little more moisturized than before. I’m so bummed out.,0.0
"I was really excited to try this PreCleanse by Dermalogica because if I can save time and money from having to use several wipes and oils- then it will be worth it. I’ve had to use tons of remover wipes and oils to remove my make up at the end of the day. I always have to go over my face multiple times to get everything off. The hardest part for me is getting the mascara and eyeliner from under my eyes.I started by dispensing the PreCleanse into my dry hands and massaging over my dry face and eyes first. You don’t want to add water right away. When you add the PreCleanse dry. It helps to dissolve surface oil and dirt. Once you have fully scrubbed and massage your face then follow with a warm water rinse. After that I still had to go over my face with a makeup wipe. But instead of 3 to 5- I only had to use one. I still had the stubborn makeup under my eyes even after the PreCleanse I did notice an oily residue even after rinsing a lot and drying my face. But the oiliness went away as soon as my face dried. After fully removing my makeup, I then use a toner and moisturizer. When I woke up the next morning and the days after, I did not have one breakout! This product is Vegan, paraben-free, sulfate free and great for all skin types!",1.0
I like that it has a gentle vanilla smell and is not over-powering. I have very dry/cracking lips in the winter and this has helped tremendously so far.,1.0
I’m in such a shock that influenster sent me such a huge sample. This stuff is light on the face but makes my face instantly smoothe,1.0
i like how fast the consistency absorbs and how smooth it leaves the skin i received a sample and i am loving it,1.0
Got this complimentary from Skinfix in exchange for my honest review. I have always been very curious to try Skinfix because so many people rave about their moisturizers. This Peptide cream couldn’t have come at a better time as my skin has been very dry lately. This helped with regaining and retaining my skin’s moisture and kept it hydrated throughout the day/night. I have also been using some strong skincare products which resulted in losing natural moisture. But barrier cream helped get a protective layer and a natural and healthy glow to my skin.,1.0
"I loved the way it made my skin look, but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it. It’s probably the octocrylene which is known to be problematic for people with sensitive skin. The smell is also pretty awful, a very strong sunscreen smell. If my skin could tolerate the formula I’d probably suffer through the smell. Here’s to hoping they reformulate it for sensitive skin.",0.0
Amazing! My skin looks so refreshed and I love the smell. And it has zero fragrance. I used to get drunk elephant papa retro whip but didn’t love it. Was suggested this and it’s phenomenal. I got the eye cream and love it. Will get the honeymoon one after I run out of drink elephant tlc.,1.0
"Pleasantly surprised by this product it’s so light and the texture is almost like a jelly. My skin feels instantly hydrated like it’s drinking water. I love using this after a hot shower/before bed, very happy!",1.0
"The Laneige sleeping mask has become one of my holy grail products. I have dry chapped lips that usually require hydration every two hours. However, ever since I started using this lip mask, my lips look and feel softer, plumper, and pinker. I have little lines in my lips which I hate and I feel that this oroduct smoothed those out slightly!!! It does feel a little heavy when applied but not too sticky. And I personally like that feeling because it makes me feel like my lips are moisturized. It might be a little pricier than the average lip chap but I highly recommend it! It’s well worth the price. I received this product through the Influenster program but I’ve already repurchased a tub before my first one was even finished!!",1.0
"this product is so good! leaves my skin glowy, fixes my blemishes and feeling hydrated!",1.0
"Such a great eye mask! So nice and thick, the spatula provided is so helpful when apply the product! I woke up with my eyes hydrated and plump! ❤️❤️",1.0
"I love this product, I started seeing a significant improvement in the look of my pores and the hyperpigmentation caused by acne scars. Highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin.",1.0
"THIS. PRODUCT. I have acne/oily skin and my face stayed matte all day long. At the end of the night I almost didn’t want to take it off because it still looked so fresh. It is light weight but full coverage for a cc cream. It’s a must if you want a soft, pore-free look all day long.",1.0
I love this product! And the price is amazing for the size. PLEASE USE A NORMAL CLEANSER AFTER THIS BALM! This product isn’t only suppose to be used on it own for the low reviews!,0.0
"Your skin will most likely purge at first, but it is WORTH IT. It has a very strong scent, but once it settles into my skin and I moisturize over it, it goes away. I use this at night only! It has noticeably changed my (oily, acne prone) skin.",1.0
"Great product, very moisturizing. Does have a strong scent during application but it doesn’t linger. I do think prolonged use has decreased the redness in my skin!",1.0
I love it! It has cleared my face up so much in just a week! Recommend to anyone who’s looking for an affordable serum that works amazing.,1.0
I love this night repair oil! My son tends to dry out and this kept it perfect and smooth.,1.0
"I received a sample size of this and I used up the entire jar, so of course I had to buy the full size.  I love the way it feels on my lips - it’s not sticky at all, but more oily feeling.  I don’t particularly have a problem with dry lips, but I like having this on just to keep them glossy and moisturized.  It also smells AMAZING!  The only reason I didn’t give it a perfect score is because I wish it would come in a squeezy tube.  I think reaching my fingers into the jar is pretty unsanitary, but I still use it anyway.",1.0
"This is one of the best makeup removers that I’ve used so far. I was concerned that it would leave my T- zone oily after use, but it doesn’t. It helps hydrate the parts of my skin that are normally dry. The fact that it’s green clean is also an added bonus.",1.0
"It is lightweight, which I enjoy, but it doesn’t seem to do much for my puffiness. It also doesn’t feel like it moisturizes quite enough. There are other products out there that I find to be more effective.",0.0
I love this moisturizer! It is thick and creamy without being heavy or greasy. I use it at night and my skin feels noticeably softer in the mornings. I will continue to purchase this moisturizer.,1.0
"I am a big fan of Vitamin C and this is one of the first times I’ve tried that has made a noticeable difference in the brightness of my skin quickly. It’s nice cause it initially comes in as a powder, so if you are using other skincare products and don’t want your vitamin C to go to waste, you can mix it when you decide. Definitely super cool! Complimentary from Drunk Elephant Ecomm.",1.0
Goes on sheer and very soft! Love the way this sits on my face. Can easily be used under makeup or by itself after moisturizing.,1.0
"Usually I start breaking out as the weather gets warmer, but using this mask twice a week has really helped to keep my skin clear and clear up scarring from previous breakouts. My scarring is not completely gone, but it really does seem like it’s fading away. The smell isn’t the best, but it’s not terrible either. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone else with oily and acne-prone skin.",1.0
"First off I was impressed with a product that could be worn several different ways, specially that it being a mask. I have a dryer sensitive skin, I have tried wearing the mask several different ways, as a moisturizer, under my makeup, overnight and as a 10 minute masque and the best way for me to use it, it is as a 10 minute masque. Otherwise it gives me little red bumps in my face the next day. If I use it just as a mask I notice my skin will be moisturized and supple.",1.0
"This is the perfect morning moisturizer!I have pretty dry skin, and I love this product so much. It’s very lightweight and keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. It is a little pricy, but mine lasted about 6 months. Cannot recommend this highly enough.",1.0
Complimentary from Summer Friday. Thank you Summer Friday for gifting me. I just used this mask last night. So far I’m liking it. It’s a really light formula that you lightly apply to the face and leave on for 10mins and then just wash it off. I’m loving how my skin is looking. My pores have shrink in size To where they are barely visible. Skin looks more awake and radiant. So first impression I’m happy. Definitely will be using again.,1.0
Absolutely love! I’ve seen a major difference in my skin since I started using the mask. I have started to use it as my daily nightly moisturizer and it’s fantastic!,1.0
"I used this as well as the water cream and it did nothing for my skin. My face has become drier and has been producing a lot more pimples. Not sure if it has to do with the weather change or what but my skin has definitely taken a turn for the worst. It also did nothing for my pores. I don’t see what the hype is about these products, I wish they worked better for me!",0.0
Wonderful product! Deep penetrating moisturizer! This lasts all day! It’s expensive but so worth it!,1.0
I love the citrus scent of this moisturizer and the cooling sensation when putting on. The ginseng and coffee bean energize and rejuvenate my skin. I really am happy with the texture and that this soaks in quickly and is oil free so it doesn’t leave any residue. I do like a moisturizer with SPF especially summer so that’s a drawback. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1.0
"I can see this working for someone with dryer skin. However, this is not for normal or combination skin. It is so greasy, does not absorb into skin just sits on top. I like the skinfix serum that has done wonders for my skin, I thought this would be just as light, but it is a heavy cream.Mousturizers like this are not for me.",0.0
This is OFFICIALLY my new favorite self tanner. It doesn’t have that strong scent most self tanners have and I can still use my daily moisturizer/ lotion with it. You’ll definitely want to wash your hands after or it may stain your palms but overall I’m obsessed!,1.0
"It worked well with my skin, I do think it’s a good product however I cannot justify it for the price. I enjoyed the sample I received for review purposes.",1.0
"I LOVE these!! They don’t leave behind scars like the Skyn Iceland acne dots do on my face! These dots make the pimple smaller but the trick is to pop it a little and THEN wear the dot so there’s an opening for the dot to absorb the inside gunk from. I know this sounds gross, but trust me, the next day your pimple will be TINY. DEF RECOMMEND",1.0
"If you want to be able to use the same cleanser every night this probably isn’t for you unless you have dry skin. I love it for the times when my skin has that dried out feel due to weather or use of glycolic serum/retinol. For me, it’s a wonderful complement to the Pekee bar soap, which is still what I use most often, but can leave my skin feeling too tight under certain conditions.  It’s also a great complement to the DE retinol, which is pretty strong.Once I started using the recommended nickel-sized dab I had no trouble getting it to emulsify with water and rinse off.",1.0
"I have been wanting to try this moisturizer for soooo long and I’m so happy I finally got the chance to. I have oily, acne prone skin and this doesn’t make my skin oily or break me out. It wears really well under makeup and I have noting bad to say about it.",1.0
I love this primer i recieved compliments of Influenster! This is weightless and makes my skin look great. My make up looks brighter too.,1.0
Melts into your skin and gives you the smoothest skin. I’m hooked.,1.0
"really LOVED the coverage this gave me - I’m very red across my cheeks - no makeup is ever able to cover it. This was the first thing that did an awesome job, however, my sensitive skin did not take kindly to the SPF and started causing regular breakouts/welts. It’s a shame, I miss using it. If you’re sensitive to SPF, beware- otherwise this is amazing",0.0
Went into Sephora looking for youth to the people but they were sold out so this was recommended. I hate that I even waisted money on this. I’m even more upset that the sales lady recommended this. It’s horrible. Just slides across your face like snot. Does not clean skin. I’m livid,0.0
"I use it all the time as a balm and overnight, my lips have never been this soft.",1.0
"It works! The first time I used it it stung a little but it helped and my face looks smoother, clear and soft. The price is also a great selling point. Highly recommend it.",1.0
"1. I LOVE Laneige. 2. The sleeping mask was annoying to carry around & dip my fingers in... so I bought this.It’s just as great it’s more glossy which is nice but it’s a thinner consistency. So It doesn’t stay on my lips as long as the sleeping mask. For a few more dollars the sleeping mask is a better buy plus it having more product. If you love the sleeping mask, I think you should just buy some empty lip gloss tubes and put it in there.",1.0
perfect for everyday use. i use this with my quarts roller to depuff my face every morning and it works very well! it feels nice on the skin and is definitely worth the price,1.0
Got this in a sample size. I like trying different method of removing my makeup. I don’t wear heavy makeup on a daily basis. I usually just do some eye makeup. I use waterproof mascara and it can be sometimes hard to remove. This butter cleanser is okay. I do find myself having to rub consistently around my eyes to make sure all the waterproof mascara comes off. If I don’t wash it off properly I do find my eyes getting irritated which is annoying. It doesn’t wash off easily. I cleanse after with the YTTP cleanser and that helps to remove any remaining makeup including this butter cleaner. The consistency is definitely buttery and I’m honestly not the biggest fan of the smell but I find it bearable. I’m going to purchase and try the Farmacy cleansing balm and hopefully that washes off better than this.,0.0
"Gifted by Farmacy. If you have really dry skin, your skin will thank you this cream is extremely thick and I mean thick! What I like about this cream is it absorbs into the skin quickly and your skin will feel hydrated. Highly recommend.",1.0
I loved this product. It legit felt like my skin was glowing way more than before and I could tell how smooth my skin was after the first few weeks and being consistent with my skin care routine.Cons: The scent of the serum is strong. It has like a woodsy/grassy smell. I was able to tolerate it and I feel like I can just dismiss it now lol.Disclosure on my skin: I have combo to normal skin. Sensitive skin. Fairly clear skin until TOM comes around.,1.0
This is a staple now in my beauty regimen. I love the scent of this. The product smooths on nicely and you only need a small amount. I have noticed my skin looking more smooth and hydrated. My fine lines around my eyes aren’t as noticeable either. I highly recommend.,1.0
Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protector lotion in 50+ SPF smells really nice. It’s a light pleasant scent. It goes on with a smooth and silky texture. That’s it’s 50+ SPF is excellent as it helps protect my skin from damaging sun.  It’s also water resistant which is excellent for outdoor activities. I can wear this under my makeup with no issues. I highly recommend this sunblock. I received this for free for a fair and honest review.,1.0
"wow.. so at first I really just thought this was like every other peeling gel, it crumbles the dead skin and deff works.. but what I wasnt expecting was for the following couple days my skin was actually peeling.. and red. My face is acting as if I got a professional peel. I’m not mad at it at all because when the redness and peeling goes away, my skin is shiny and refreshed.. pores seem smaller also.",1.0
"From the packaging to the eye cream itself, it screams luxurious. I usually prefer pumps over jars for sanitary reasons but this comes with a mini plastic scooper. I keep the scooper clean so it keeps the product from contamination. The eye cream has a pleasant smell to it. I love putting it on as the last step of my skincare routine at night because it’s so moisturizing to my under eye area. I have been using for a week and I feel that my under eye area is still moisturized in the morning when I wake up. I dab a little bit on in the morning to keep my under eyes moisturized so my fine lines aren’t as prominent under makeup.",1.0
"This is a nice toner for normal to dry skin. Unfortunately, my combo/oily summer skin doesn’t need this level of moisture. My skins gets drier in the winter, so I plan to save it for the colder months. I used it for a week after cleansing my skin at night and I was impressed with how quickly it soaks into the skin. If I only use a tiny amount, my skin doesn’t get too oily by the morning. I received this free from Influenster for testing purposes but the opinions expressed are my own.",1.0
"Works great on my dry, sensitive skin. No breakouts and leaves my skin super soft",1.0
"Belif continues to impress me! All of their products are so hydrating. I have combination skin so the areas around my eye tend to be more oily than other parts of my face. I love that this moisturizer lasts the whole day without making eye area overly shiny/oily/greasy/etc. after hours of wear. A little goes a long way so I think for the amount of product you get, it’s well worth the price.",1.0
"I don’t often repurchase products because I’m always looking to try something new, but this is one of the products that I have repurchased 2 times now. It is very hydrating and comfortable under make up, it makes my foundation go on smoothly. It is very beautiful and gentle on the skin as I have very sensitive skin and this product has not irritated by skin. It does not leave the skin looking oily or greasy, it’s a very nice moisturizer/primer that gets absorbed into the skin.",1.0
"I received this as a VoxBox from Influencter, and was a little skeptical at first, as I’d been using one specific under eye cream for years. I decided to give this one a try, and am head over heels! I have always had problems with dark undereye skin, and thought it was just my lot in life. Within a week of using the Tatcha eye cream, I noticed the skin looked less dark, and was noticeably brighter in tone as well! It’s very creamy, light, and is easy to apply. I absolutely love it, and it’s replaced the one I used to use for good! I definitely recommend this to anyone who has stubborn dark circles under their eyes.",1.0
I tried different methods of application but it always made my skin look cakey and highlighted dry patches of skin badly. Also oxidized to look orange on my skin so I couldn’t use it as a concealer. So sad because I really wanted to like it.,0.0
"I would give the product a four and a half if I could because I really liked it. It made my abnormally oily skin get much less oily in a matter of two to three days. I get breakouts here and there and I’m pretty sure that this serum doesn’t cause it nor does it help REALLY prevent it. I used to get blackheads of my forehead here and there and I haven’t gotten one in at least a month! I have filaments on my nose and unfortunately, this didn’t help much but like I said, it didn’t make it worse. All around a pretty good product and would recommend to try. Don’t have SUPER high expectations though.",1.0
Absolutely LOVE. I use a dime sized amount and rub it in my hands than pat my face. the tiniest amount works wonders!,1.0
This item deserves 10 stars. I have used this during 100% humidity in the UAE heat and my flat ironed hair withstands it! A must have!,1.0

"After using the product twice, a few days apart, my skin has this amazing glow and fullness. I’m 28 so I’m just starting to use anti aging products. This made me feel like I’m 23 again! If you’re looking for a product that will bring out your best skin, this is it!",1.0

"I’ve had chronic dry chapped lips for years and nothing has worked. I gave this a try when it first launched and haven’t stopped using for years! It’s AMAZING and it’s the only thing that has worked for me consistently eversince I first tried it! I wake up to plump full juicy lips every morning. Yes, it’s thick but you’re supposed to put it on before bed and just go to sleep, not touch it. One jar lasts a loooong time and well worth the price. It’s actually cheaper than all those $30+ balms that you lose in your car, purse, desk, etc.Keep this on your nightstand give it a try!",1.0
This is an amazing cream. I use for a week and my skin feels so soft and overall texture improved.  It’s softened fine lines and wrinkles and skin is very smooth. The pores are refine and looks refreshed.,1.0
"I have very dry and sensitive skin and this is the only thing that doesn’t dry me out and actually reduces redness after I’ done cleaning my face. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, I would definitely recommend for a last step final cleanser.",1.0
This cream has such a nice texture and left my skin feeling super hydrated and dewy. It’s very light and I was able to easily layer SPF on top. The smell was a little strong but that’s just my opinion. It was a natural floral scent.,1.0
"I love (almost) everything about this product. As mentioned in other reviews, if you want the most bang for your buck (and best application), I would recommend pouring a small amount into your hands and patting it in. Using the cotton pad soaks up a lot of the product and lessens its effectiveness in my experience. It would be five stars, but I don’t like how the roses do somewhat clog the hole, but it’s a pretty easy fix and doesn’t bother me too much. The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. In conjunction with some other products, it has helped lessened the appearance of my pores on my face substantially. Very hydrating and mixes well with an essence (if you’re a skincare person like me). Serums and this product go hand in hand. Will be purchasing.",1.0
"Smells lovely, nice texture. Unfortunately did nothing to improve my skin in terms of moisture, texture, or appearance. No negative changes, but none positive either.",0.0

Mehhhh. I wouldn’t really call this matte. Made me super oily and shiny by the end of the day. Also it smudged everywhere. I give it two stars because the color was on point.,0.0
"This is a nice thick cream that I actually add on specific areas of my face on the days that I fly as a flight attendant because there is no moisture on airplanes! Once I put it semi-thickly in my driest areas near my mouth and then I spread it lightly all over. People talk about leaving it on and not washing it off like a mask but it doesn’t even say that on the tube it says you can blot it with a warm cloth if you want after 10 minutes but you don’t need to take it off at all which I don’t. I noticed that I look much better, even younger because of being more moisturized at the end of a 14 hour day. It was recommended when I had a free in-store face treatment and I’m glad I purchased! Will purchase again.",1.0

"I’ve been using this for years.  My skin dried out after trying a skincare system and I went through several kinds of moisturizer trying to find some relief for my awful flaky face.  This doesn’t leave my skin feeling slimy or greasy and there is not a flake in sight.  It’s also great for when my hands, elbows, or feet have had a particularly rough day.  At first I was using the travel size but I’ve decided to commit to this size and I’m never going back.",1.0
I have extremely dry skin so I usually use a hydrating serum and a moisture cream but this cream was soooo hydrating that I didn’t need the serum. It has no smell and settled in very nicely. I absolutely loved it!,1.0
"As someone who has very oily skin, I’ve had trouble finding a night cream to use that doesn’t make me wake up with oily blobs on my forehead. This moisturizer is fantastic. It hydrates my skin while still leaving it feeling smooth, matte, and clean. It’s helped to control oil production overnight. The price tag is the only reason why I’ve struggled to buy the full size of this product, but after trying several smaller samples I can see the difference and feel that it is worth it for the way my face feels the next day.",1.0
I love this product! It makes me look so refreshed and it really evens my skin tone! I just think it’s a bit overpriced,1.0
"I can’t believe how well this works for the price. This has evened out my 35 year old skin tone, helped clear up some uneven texture on my chin, and smoothed pores. I always apply a richer moisturizer on the nights I use this toner as it can be very drying to my skin. But other than that which is to be expected, I am super impressed!",1.0
I am so disappointed that they have changed the formula! I have used the WrinkleResist24 for years,0.0
"I has loads of little pimples on my forehead along with hairline acne. I bought this cleanser because of the salicylic acid and I must say that it has worked. Within a week of using this this day and night, my forehead cleared and any texture I had did as well. For the price point and effectiveness I give this five stars. Also it has no fragrance so it won’t be bad for sensitive skin, try it out!",1.0
"I take off two stars because of the texture and the packaging. It feels so rough massaging on my skin.  And to squeeze out the product, I have to take the bottle up side down which is inconvenient in a hurry.",0.0
It melts make up into a soothing cleansing cream that feels like a luxorious face massage. A great way to treat one self. I bought the full size after trying a sample.,1.0
"Since this is a Huda product, I wasn’t expecting nothing less than perfect, and it definitely fulfilled my expectations, it’s easy to use and after a few uses you can already feel the difference on your skin, it also have a really good smell! I’ll buy again soon!",1.0
works really well. reduces redness and size.,1.0
"Received a trial size using my points. It’s amazing that a tiny amount completely removed all of my makeup to included waterproof eyeliner and mascara all with one single wash It did not leave the ugly black residual smudges either. Skin felt clean and hydrated, glowing. Did not clog my pores. The price seemed high but I realized a very small amount got the job done in a sinle wash. I totally went to a Sephora and purchased the full size, it will last forever. 2-3 pumps is all that is needed the pump is nice as well as the packaging.  The smell is also pleasant and not overbearing.",1.0
I dont know how I feel about this product. I only tried it once but not sure what its supposed to do really.. Doesn’t hyrate me so I am a bit confused..,1.0
"This moisturizer feels like heaven, the texture is creamy but light and the scent is like an orange sorbet. After using this moisturizer for around 3 weeks my skin feels more hydrated and looks brighter and more radiant than before when I was using the cetaphil. Pro Tip: Use this under makeup, it works wonders. I received this product complimentary to sample however these opinions are my own!",1.0
The only sunscreen that doesn’t break me out and leave a filmy residue - love it.,1.0
"I love this product. I naturally gave extremely oily and super sensitive skin. But at some point in time during winter, my skin started to burn no matter what i did. I talked to an aesthetian who explained to my that my skin was probably really dry despite it being oily. So i started using this product and it’s done wonders. Skin feels really moisturized, less oily, and it’s so much brighter. I have a natural glow i didn’t have before. Con: it definitely did not help any of my dark spots/hyperpigmentation. But i use it religiously and will never stop.",1.0
"I got this product through an Influenster VoxBox and it was probably my favorite. After using the face wash, my face was so smooth and felt hydrated and not dried out like some face washes can do. The product had a good scent and felt so good on my skin. I have dry skin and it did not make that worse or seem to irritate it. Highly recommend this product!",1.0
Great light weight hydration for the face. Felt my skin get smoother within days of use.,1.0
I got this product free from Influenster. I have been looking for a long time for a sleep mask for my dry skin and I think this is it. The consistency is thicker which is need for dry skin and my face felt so soft and hydrated when I woke up. Some people compared this to the Laneige sleep mask I tried that one too and it wasn’t enough to help my dry skin like this was. Once I finish the one I have I will definitely purchase this item!!,1.0
Love this. I even bought it in the jumbo size. It’s so moisturizing,1.0
"It’s a bit thick at first, but a little goes a long way!! If you are used to lighter moisturizers, it might be a bit of a transition, but so far, I really like it!",1.0
thank youuuuu summer fridays for repackaging this goddess lip balm! obsessed with the new applicator and I’m so happy we still get the same amount of product in the tube! buy this guys! you won’t regret it,1.0
"I wouldn’t call this a mask.  It’s a thick cream.  This has def been blown way up from social media, but I do give them credit in the hydration department.  I use it either overnight or all day on days when I’m not wearing makeup/have a bad sunburn.  Worth it more if you purchase during a sale.",1.0
"I received a tube of this from Influenster in exchange for a review. I like the thicker texture of this gel/cream hybrid, and the smell is pleasant. It did burn my eyes, always a bit of an alarm bell for a facial moisturizer, but it did leave my face feeling nice and dewy.",1.0
"The texture of this serum is unlike other serums I’ve used. It’s a light cream - which is unexpectedly great. I find it sinks into the skin great, and leaves a glowy and plump look to my skin. I noticed a huge difference the first couple weeks of use in the brightness of my face  butttt I think the brightening affect has diminished (which is why I have substracted a star). I’ve added a photo of my hand immediately after use and I think it’s an instant brightening affect. A couple other things I’ve enjoyed about the product are the scent, light and refreshing and of course the packaging is great. I enjoy products with a pump, help it to stay fresh and keep unnecessary germs out. I think I would repurchase when I’ve used it up.",1.0
"I live in the desert where it’s hot, cold and extremely dry. Finally I’ve found a product that keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day.",1.0
"I just got this today and so far, my lips feel great using it. The smell is familiar to watermelon candy, BUT if you’re not one for strong scents, this may not be your cup of tea.",1.0
"I have used this product a few times and it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth after use. After use my skin also smelled amazing and rosy. I think the application is messy because the hole on the top of the bottle is a little too big. Also, I did end up breaking out on my chin after a couple uses but i am not sure if it was definitely related. i plan to definitely continue using this product.I received this product for free for testing purposes but this review is my own.",1.0
"This moisturize leaves a gorgeous glow on the skin. It works beautifully under foundations and tinted moisturizers. I also tried wearing it on its own and it left my skin dewy but I prefer the way it looks under a foundation. It’s not heavily scented either, which is a plus.",1.0
forst time I ever I tried this was as a sample. I loved it but $80 was just not in my buget so of course when this one came out I got it IMMEDIATELY. Yes it tingles a lot but you get use to it and it’s so worth it. I especially how my makeup goes on after using this facial in conjunction with day to day skin routine.,1.0
"I love these little cotton square gems. At first I thought what a gimmick, buying extra-posh cotton... But these are now a staple among my beauty products. They are very cost effective in a few ways than generic store brand cotton rounds/squares. First, the cost difference is insignificant for the amount you receive especially in comparison to the quality. Second, I definitely use much less product when applying with these cotton squares. Also, they are extremely extremely soft and gentle. This is the first cotton I have used on my eyes that actually felt nonabrasive. These are an all-around win in my opinion. Definitely worth the purchase again and again!",1.0
"This product is super lightweight on the skin, and leaves no visible trace behind. It blends effortlessly into the skin and absorbs quickly, so you forget it’s on and doesn’t have any discomfort the way other sunscreens do. It has a pleasant delicate citrusy scent that disappears after a few seconds. I have sensitive skin that breaks into hives for some products but despite the scent this hasn’t irritated my skin at all. I love the high SPF and it’s so light that it’s easy to reapply later.",1.0
"This is definitely a great purchase for winter! My lips are always chapped when it’s cold but this helped out a lot! While there are better options for the price, this is definitely a great product and worth the money!",1.0
Gifted by Goop Glow for my honest review.I love how easy it is to use. I love how I open it and I can use it right away. I love how I use it before bed and wake up and start my day. I love that I don’t need to rinse off.,1.0
"Skin feels good after using it, doesn’t leave it super tight or itchy. My dry skin seems to like it. It also has a nice scent.",1.0
This serum is absolutely amazing! I’m so glad I got to try it out. I’ve been looking for a hydrating anti aging serum and this is it! I love that it has hyaluronic acid as it is one of my favorite ingredients in skincare. Highly recommend this product,1.0
did they discontinue the regular energy boosting gel???! that was my jam now its “ultra hydrating“ and “oil free“ . none worked for me like the regular one. This one is okay but feels a little heavy on my face.,0.0
This product made me breakout and left me feeling disappointed.,0.0
"I’m a first time Tatcha user, after receiving this product and washing my face I poured some in my hand. It’s like water so hard to keep it from running out between my fingers. I splashed some on my face and it gave it a cool feeling and I felt more refreshed if anything. My skin felt very hydrated and ready for the day.",1.0
Immediately loved the mint smell. So refreshing. My skin also has an immediate glow that latest all day. My skin felt smooth and hydrated.,1.0
I like this cream. It didn’t really do any magic to my skin but it sure is soft and no breakouts the next morning.,1.0
good moisturizer before makeup,1.0
I have been wanting to try this for a while due to the hype around it.  I was sent it free in exchange for a review and I will say that this completely lives up to the hype! I’ve had issues with my eyes getting gunky after very heavy eye creams and that has not happened with this. My concealer is also sitting so much better on my skin!,1.0
"Since I hit 30, I’ve started investing in better skincare products. I bought this and - yeah - it’s good. Very moisturizing and softening. But, unless you have money to blow, I don’t think it’s worth the expensive price tag when there are other great (and less expensive) moisturizers on the market. I’ve been using it for a year now and haven’t noticed a difference in my skin -- although, since it’s SO expensive, I probably use less than necessary to achieve actual results. Trust me, at this price tag you will use the bare minimum too. It’s thick, which is nice in the winter. However, it is too thick to wear under makeup IMO. It’s also very dense/hard in the jar. You need to rub it in your fingers to “warm“ it up. By the time you get it on your face, most of the product is absorbed into your hands. Just something to think about. Would I recommend it? Yes. Do I think there are less expensive comparable products? Yes.",1.0
I absolutely loved this product! It has such an amazing smell and works perfect for sensitive skin. I use it at night everyday and when I wake up my skin is smooth!,1.0
"I absolutely love this oil, it does wonders for my skin, however I was extremely disappointed when I came to relize its only ingredient was marula oil..... so NOT worth the price.",0.0
I haven’t noticed a difference from using it and it’s been months.,0.0
"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I loved how the Tatcha dewy serum glided on my face. It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way. For each application I only needed one pump! I think it made my face a little more radiant and definitely helped to minimize the fine lines starting to show up on my forehead. I think with long term use this is definitely effective for diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.",1.0
This stuff this a game changer! I have acne prone skin and hyperpigmentation. I’ve used this product for the last two years and it has done so much for my skin! My boyfriend even lives the citrus aroma. I absolutely live by this product and the Origins line.,1.0
It help me with pore clogging. Susan Yara was right; i bought it for her,1.0
This is my go to toner and I never go without it. It makes your skin feel clean and healthy after every use. Can’t say enough good things about Clinique and this product I highly recommend this toner.,1.0
I’ve become more concerned with preventative skincare and I’m so excited to add this to my routine. I love how it applies and the texture is wonderful - sometimes eye creams are too thick. It blends in smoothly too,1.0
I love Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane! It’s light weight but leaves my skin feeling so soft! No greasy feeling at all. My skin has felt healthier too!,1.0
I went to Sephora and this was the one that they kept recommending and I tried it for a week. And have never had a moisturizer that has made my skin this oily. I have oily skin and this moisturizer added more oily on it and didn’t hydrate at all. This product makes my skin dehydrated and makes it feel awful. If you have oily skin I would not get this. Very disappointed with this product. Also makes your face red and breaks it out.,0.0
What a great product!! I was worried about the acids drying out my skin but this left my face silky smooth and smelling great! I have very sensitive skin but the light grape scent didn’t effect it and was a great addition to this product. Definitely a great buy!,1.0
So amazing for oily skin!!! would highly recommend if you have oily skin or breakout easily. This along with the retinol really works for my skin type.,1.0
"I’m clearly in the minority here, but I’m really not impressed with this. I will say for pros, it doesn’t irritate my skin or break me out. For cons, it just doesn’t really do anything, and it’s a greasy product that doesn’t dry down. I’ve been using it consistently for about 3 months now, and I don’t notice any difference in my skin. That said, skincare is very individual, and different people will experience different results. This product just isn’t for me.",0.0
"My blackheads, oil, and milia was significantly decreased after the first time using this moisturizer! I received it as a sample in the “Best of Origins“ pack and use it at night, wake up with clear skin in the AM. Ordered the full size product the next day.",1.0
Wow honestly love this product is amazing and literally perfect for this a year.. if you have dry skin and want some moisture skin thru out the day definitely give this a try. Quiet I love with it. And on top of everything I got to try this As a complementary product from influenster.,1.0
This sunscreen has a unique spf — 40 to be exact. I do aim to use sunscreen that I at least spf 30 so this fits the bill. This one is perfect for ‘no makeup’ makeup or alone without makeup because it actually gives your skin a nice glow. I would prefer that the moisturizing and glow effects be longer lasting but my skin looks bomb right after using this. The benefit of having a glow effect is that the sunscreen is not white and therefore doesn’t give a white cast and blends into the skin easily. I actually really liked it and see myself using it over and over especially for summer.,1.0
This stuff is a holy grail. It makes my skin so soft and gives it a literal glow. I usually have large pores and red skin and this helps combat that. Love it.,1.0
I’m not super impressed with this. You have to make sure your face has been properly exfoliated and moisturized before using these drops otherwise they’ll cling to your dry spots and look soooo bad. They look glowy and natural everywhere except my nose and around my eyebrows bc they get so orange and dark around there. I put it all around my mouth too and there’s still a white circle around my mouth where the tan didn’t absorb. Not super happy with these especially since they’re not cheap,0.0
"The SKII skin care facial treatment essence is some thing that I have heard about for a very long time. But, I haven’t had a chance to try it until now it is known for its antiaging properties and unfortunately that is not some thing that I can judge on in the short time we using it. But, I can say it is a joy to use as it is as light as water and it is very refreshingTo tap into the skin. It is refreshing and absorbs quickly. I look forward to using it for the rest of the bottle in hopes that I can help reduce my fine lines. I’m very happy I was given the chance to try it. I understand why it is so popular.",1.0
I received a sample of this in my allure beauty box and fell in love. This feels so refreshing and not heavy at all! wears well under make up also.,1.0
Love this product. It’s very gentle and it did not dry my face out. It also removed all my makeup. I bought the small one to try but will be repurchasing the larger size.,1.0
"I was disappointed with this product. I love their night time glycolic serum, but this moisturizer does not work with my oily / acne-prone skin. I have been using it at night and when I first apply it my skin feels soft, but when I wake up their is an extra layer of oil on my face. I’m also noticing milia around my eyes. Will not be using again.",0.0
LITERALLY the best! I have used so many skin products and this is by far one of my favorites. The enzyme scrub removes dead skin cells and leaves your face feeling so fresh and pure. I have some acne scars and have noticed my face looking better in just a couple of weeks. Yo Glow is now apart of my daily face routine!,1.0
Absolutely love. Thick enough to feel moisturized but not too thick to feel greasy overnight or under makeup. Did not aggravate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts.,1.0
"I was extremely excited to try this product (received this product from Influenster) because I have tried the Fresh 24 hour cream and really liked it. I used this mask for a couple of weeks and my skin looked plumped and hydrated. I used a small amount and my skin absorbed it well. However, I did notice my skin started to get dryer/flaky/ textured and that usually happens when I don’t moisturize my skin so I switched back to my holy grail aveeno ultra calming night cream. This is a thicker cream and hard to find but you your skin will thank you later and your wallet will too.",0.0
I received this Daily Microfoliant complimentary from Dermalogica I exchange for my  review. I have been using this New brightening rice based powder exfoliate for couple days and I love the way my oily skin looks refreshing and smooth. Very easy to use just add little water to the powder and apple in circular motion for one minute. I love how tight and smooth my skin looks. I will definitely add it to my daily routine.,1.0
"I cannot give this product enough praise. I have incredibly sensitive skin when it comes to sunscreen. Even showing my face the tube causes my eyes to burn and eczema to flare up around my mouth. So much so I often skip it. This summer instead of blowing through my pricey Bare Minerals for every day wear around the house which has spf...I decided to try tomorrow moisturizer with spf. I tried Ulta brand and it felt so heavy like I may as well have been wearing foundations plus it caused deep breakouts that took weeks to clear up. No bueno. I than moved onto pricey drug store products. Cera Ve daily face moisturizer with spf, Vichy, etc. I still needed to use my regular moisturizer underneath. Cera be felt OK but overwhelming typical sunscreen smell AND my face still felt sticky and weighted down and started having to research no-wash options for quickly cleaning my face at the end of the day to remove it, without having to go through my whole face washing routine. Then I found this while browsing at Sephora. I was looking at Shiseido and as always overwhelming with my options. I fell in love with this right then and there in the store after trying it on. I literally wear it every day. I put it on after my morning routine and know if I step outside for a walk at lunch I’m good plus what a difference it’s made in helping set my eyes for the day!I can’t feel it. My skin doesn’t notice it T ALL!! I haven’t broken out once because of this which every other spf whether for sensitive skin, non-comodogenic, etc always do. I don’t even feel like I need to wash my face after putting this on and it does not bother my eczema. It doesn’t smell like sunscreen at all instead I find the smell, what little there is, to be very refreshing. To me (and again it’s unscented but a slight product smell) it reminds me of pool water which only enhances to experience for me as I love that smell. So far it works because I have spent lots of time out in the sun and no color at all.",1.0
"So I have oily combo skin, but I needed a more hydrating moisturizer because my skin was getting flaky and dehydrated. Probably a combination of winter and retinol. But since using this I haven’t had any flakes! I think I’m going to start only using this at night now that the flakiness is gone but it’s an absolutely devine cream. Was slightly surprised at the small container but you actually don’t need to use much since it’s so hydrating.",1.0
"I found this serum left my skin hydrated, smooth and velvety. I’ve only tried it a few times but it seems to minimize and fill in my fine lines. I  did notice some pilling when I apply at night, so I may need to apply my facial products in a different order. Overall, I did like and do recommend it!",1.0
"Very light and not greasy,moisturizes the under eye area well, no irritating fragrance and very affordable.",1.0
"I picked the jelly cleanser/moisturiser set as my birthday gift, and let me just say that it is absolutely unfair how expensive this moisturizer is, because it’s the best one I’ve ever used. I’m spoiled for other moisturizers. I can’t go back. It makes my skin so soft, even the couple of spots that other moisturizers haven’t been able to smooth out. I barely need to use more than a few dots, and I have soft skin. And it doesn’t irritate at all. I have really sensitive skin and I’ve tried them all- gels, water-gels, gel-to-creams, creams, the whole lot. And it turns out this stuff is what I needed. And I’m so darn mad because it’s so expensive. That’s why it only gets 4 stars. Because let’s be real, it’s worth it and I’ll keep buying it.",1.0
"Love this! It is moisturizing and spiked with a blend of avocado, mongongo,",1.0
"I received this product in the PLAY! May box and wow does it work! Within one use I noticed clearer, glowing skin, and my friends and family did too. The small sample size lasted me a month, so I took the plunge and bought the full size. It’s an investment, but totally worth it and will last a long time.",1.0
This stuff is so good! I got the mini to try out- it’s amazing for first cleanse! Love the texture! Super good if you wear a lot of makeup and sunscreen like myself!,1.0
One of my favorite night products,1.0
"Love, love, love this product! I usually use it in the evening before going to bed, and the next day my face is so soft like baby! I have most of the companies products and this is my favorite by far!",1.0
"There are so many things I love about this product. I’m not big on face oil and never included it in my skincare routine but this oil is now a staple for me. It doesn’t leave a greasy feeling on my face. I find it absorbs into my skin within seconds and has made putting on my mineral sunscreen such a breeze. I used to find my sunscreen would pile but it hasn’t since I started using this oil. It does have a fragrance but it’s not overpowering. It’s very light and honey like. It has a silky, smooth feeling to it and the beads instantly melt away. It looks and feels like an expensive product. I’ll be buying the full size once I’m finished with the sample. Definitely worth giving a try for anyone considering it or is on the fence! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1.0
"Started using this Lip Balm after beginning accutane/isotretinoin, which is notorious for ultra dry lips and causing super bad sunburns. This product saved me from both! With other lip balms (like Aquaphor) I would have to re-apply at least every 15mins, but I only had to apply this like 3 times a day max. The barrier it provided for my lips was incredible, plus I loved the flavors. Now that I’m off accutane I still use it everyday.",1.0
"I’ve got very sensitive skin and live in a very dry climate. I’ve got trouble zones and constant mask-wearing doesn’t help my issues with breakouts. This face wash keeps my skin balanced and clear. It’s mild, foams nicely and keeps my skin from drying out while. I hope they make this product forever and ever.",1.0
I absolutely love this cleanser! You only need a tiny bit and it will lather up your face nicely. It has the most amazing smell. It really leaves your face feeling plump and soft. I can’t say enough good things about it. This cleanser has convinced me to try out other products from Tatcha and the cleanser is one of the more affordable products from their line. Will definitely keep this cleanser in my routine.,1.0
"A little bit goes a long way, it put 3 tiny drops specifically on redness areas. I use it only at night, dabbing it on after moisturizer. When I wake up I don’t feel oily, as my skin has fully absorbed it in. Overall very happy, if I feel extra oily at any point then I stop using it for a day. It really helps with balancing my skin and dryness.",1.0
"I like this as an overnight mask. I just cleanse, tone and put this on. I’m not crazy about the smell. It has a toothpaste smell. I wake up to clear, bright and plump skin. It really does the job when my skin is looking dull or freaking out.",1.0
"This is an Ahhhhmazing High- Quality Eye Cream. This is the kind of product you dream about, the ones that really do what they say they are supposed to and you see results so quickly it is kind of mind blowing. I am true believer in using only the best product on my aging face and Clinique is a trusted name with backed results. I could feel a tightening and minimalizaion of wrinkles on the bottom top and sides of my eye area. This is a clinical repair eyecream that delivers.",1.0
"This oil is my favorite because of how quickly it sinks into the skin. I use this as a last step in my routine and it still doesn’t leave my skin greasy or pill up with any of my other products. This leaves your skin so soft,hydrated and glowing !",1.0
"this is a very moisturizing cream and definitely made my skin quite hydrated. I do have combination skin so I have to go easy on my T-zone with this product, but it keeps my cheeks very well hydrated. I like this before my foundation as it seems to help my foundation go on more smoothly. I’ve also used it at night to keep my skin hydrated. I received a complimentary product for review.",1.0
"I was excited to try DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCAREAlpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel. The 2 step daily routine is so easy and mess free. Wipe #1 Exfoliate & Smooth had a pleasant invigorating scent that left my face feeling clean and refreshed. #2 The Anti_Aging Neutralizer had only a slight detectable scent that left my skin feeling hydrated. After day 3 I saw a noticeable difference in my skin. Brighter, softer, more radiant and the fine lines fading just a bit. If gave my skin a glow that I have not seen in a long while. Was gentle on my skin with no tackiness or residue left behind.  I do highly recommend and will be buying again.",1.0
Me and my husband both love it. It’s light and super hydrating. Not at all sticky,1.0
By far this  Moisturizer Is awesome! This cream keeps my face feeling super soft and bright it is smoothes out fine lines and it’s good to use it under makeup. I tend to have oily eyelids and oily under eyes aswell  but with this cream I get no creases or oily face. This cream isnt greasy at all it’s very light weight. Also its smell so good !,1.0
"I love love love this product!!! Works amazing, I use it every night before bed! Feels great and smells great! My lips are so much softer in the morning",1.0
I love this product! My skin feels so smooth and soft after using. Will continue to use,1.0
"I did not know what to expect this is my first time trying anything from this beautyline. At first I did not like the sand like gritty texture, but the cleanser has grown on me. I have been using this for the past 2 months and I love the way my skin feels it is not harsh like I thought it would be on my skin. My face is so much smoother and clearer. My husband even noticed and asked me what was I doing different so that is a plus! I am going to be honest  I do not use this daily but every other day and my complexion is glowing. I like that my pores stay clean I have had no  blackheads since using this cleanser which is a major problem for me. It works!  Now I want to try the anti aging line which this exfoliator is also part of. I definitely recommend this product.",1.0
"I like this product because it’s extremely light but hydrating. Some days and nights I need to take a break from makeup or heavy moisturizer, but I always use a toner followed by this!",1.0
This oat cleaning balm works magic. Not only does it clean off the makeup so easily and make my skin look glowy. I also love how my skin feel and look more hydrated more than ever since I used this product,1.0
I love this serum it is exfoliating and it does work well to remove dead skin.. however I feel like it could be a little bit more exfoliating.,1.0
I like stick sunscreen because it’s easy and convenient.  This glides on and has a subtle smell.  It feels good on my skin and doesn’t make my skin feel greasy or tinted!,1.0
"I have heard how good these Fresh Lip Treatments from my friends, and I am glad to received this complimentary from Fresh.  My lips are in dark shade and this Peony works well.  It is very moisturized and not like most lipstick that are dried my lips.  I love the buttery texture and it can be use for everyday.",1.0
"I thought I really liked this product. I used it for a long time with my Retina A cream. And it gave a nice hydration. However, I noticed that I started to have grown up acne on my forehead. I never had acne in my life. I thought that probably it happened because of hormonal changes. But, now after I stopped using this product, my skin is back to normal again. I never expected the problem to be this serum, but now I know that unfortunately it did not do well on my skin at all.",1.0
"Amazing for gentle makeup removal! I have a very sensitive skin, and removing makeup can be irritating even with the most gentle removers. This oily goodness leaves your skin hydrated and literally melts off the makeup.",1.0
Hands down the best exfoliator I’ve tried. I have the sample size and I’ve used it twice so far and there’s still a lot left! You only need a divine size amount. It spreads easily and doesn’t feel rough on my skin. I left it on for three minutes. If you’re using acids I would only use this twice a week max. It has a light clean fresh scent and rinses off super easily and leaves my skin glowing and feeling so soft!! I’ll definitely be buying the full size when I run out!,1.0
This moisturizer is on the thicker side. It feels hydrating and leaves the skin feeling smooth & natural. No tackines at all. I would prefer if the scent was nicer.,1.0
"Drunk Elephant has created perfection in a bottle with their TLC Sukari Babyfacial. My skin has never felt so soft, supple, and brand new. The texture of this facial is great and it spreads around your skin so nicely. You will instantly notice the product’s tingly ingredients at work! This is a very potent mask and would recommend to keep this on for around 20 minutes. I have pretty normal skin, so I actually keep this mask on all night as I use a lot of other products for hydration and I felt AMAZING in the morning. I received this in my Sephora Play! Box and will be purchasing the full product!",1.0
"It was just ok. For the price, I would’ve expected it to do more. I did notice a slight difference, but not any more than my drugstore products. Maybe you have to use it longer to get more results, but I wasn’t all that impressed.",0.0
"Very hydrating daytime moisturizer for dry skin. CT Magic Cream quickly absorbed leaving a nice dewy smooth finish. Works very well to plump, smooth, and prep for makeup. Beautiful packaging and love that it is refillable. Had some issues with congested pores in the morning after night application. If it had SPF it would be my new “must have“ daytime moisturizer.",1.0
"Oat cleansing sounds like something I would love, but it doesn’t seem to rinse off; I have a lot of residual oil left on my face which I don’t love. And it also feels like it’s separating already and I only bought it a few weeks ago.",0.0
I love this face cream. The texture of it is super fresh and skin feels super hydrated and non greasy at all. I love how hydrated my skin feels throughout the day.,1.0
"This moisturizer definitely moisturized my skin. When I would use it at night, I’d wake up with plump and firm skin. It’s not the best that I’ve used compared to my other moisturizing creams. However, it does what its advertised to do. It didn’t do anything for my skin’s tone or texture though.",0.0
This moisturizer is amazing! It immediately relieved my dry skin and kept me moisturizer all day and night.  The cream feels very light weight and the scent is very calm and mild.  I would absolutely use this again!,1.0
"For the price, I was expecting this to perform a lot better.  This goes on thick, like most cleansing balms, and it definitely needs a second cleanse afterward to get rid of the greasy feeling.  I found that it did well removing face makeup but could not tackle eye makeup (non-waterproof).",0.0
"I can honestly say that I wasn’t expecting much from this mask but I have been blown away! I slept with the mask on overnight and the next morning, my skin was hydrated, super clear, and felt so soft! I have sensitive skin and this mask didn’t make my skin sting when I used it, which is a big determining factor for me when choosing skincare products. I have a baby that wakes up several times throughout the night and this mask helped tremendously with under eye bags. I cannot wait to try other products from this company!!!!!",1.0
"I was sent this complimentary from Peace Out Skincare to test and review. I love retinol products, especially eye care. I do love the concept of this and that it’s fragrance free as I don’t like fragrance near my eyes. However, I find that you have to tug and pull too hard to get the product to transfer on to the skin, which is a major no no for fragile under eye skin. The product itself just needs to be more creamy! Other than that, it’s fantastic!",1.0
"Hats off to whoever came up with this formula and the bubblegum flavor. It has been on my recommended list for months but I’ve been ignoring it thinking I’ll stick to my Petroleum Jelly but God I was wrong. I got a trial size in my Sephora play and I’m hooked. It made my lips hydrated, soft, plump, and most importantly lovable. Ordered my full size and got it today. LOVE It!!!",1.0
It hydrated my skin but it also made me breakout. I have somewhat sensitive skin so if you do too be careful.,0.0
"Wow! I’m so glad I purchased this mask! I saw immediate results just after the first application. It does have a unique smell to it that may be bothersome to some people, but I personally like it. I will definitely be repurchasing going forward.",1.0
Eye creams almost never make a difference for me because I have really dark circles under eyes. However with Drunk Elephant eye cream I feel like my dark circles have been gradually brightened. I will continue to use it to see if it makes a significant difference but so far I’m enjoying it as much as the Vitamin C day serum,1.0
Found this product to be very similar to the Laneige lip masks. It felt very hydrating and didn’t seem to have much of a smell. I will say that although it initially felt hydrating I don’t actually think it did much for my lips. My lips still feel dry and flaky after this product wore off.,1.0
I loved this! Very lightweight product and feels good on a fresh face. It helped to keep my face soft and moisterized all day. I will definitely be purchasing this now. Thank you for the free sample!,1.0
"this product is decent, it’s an eye cream. i don’t really notice any help with my under eye circles but it feels moisturizing and layers under makeup well.",1.0
I have combination skin and this has worked wonders for me! I like to use a serum afterwards and that makes it even better!,1.0
"I’ve been using this for over two months at this point and I haven’t noticed a single difference in my texture, discoloration, or frequency of acne.",0.0
"this does the job- it removes my stubborn waterproof mineral sunscreen I slather on throughout the day and it also takes off my waterproof mascara. the only cons here are that it has a medicinal scent (obviously this isn’t bad if you’re into that sort of thing) and that I feel I have to use a lot more of this to achieve the same results I get from my Clinique Take the Day Off. this is pricier than that one too. the other one is not scented either. so all around, this is a good product that does what it says it will do and rinses away clean, but in my opinion there are better products out there that do the same thing for less money.",1.0
Just go for it without any doubt. Very good product.Even the pricing is also low.,1.0
"To start off, I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes. But, I can honestly say that this product CHANGED MY LIFE. I have very oily, acne prone skin. I also have large pores and some scarring/texture problems. My skin after a week or so of using is the smoothest, most even I’ve ever seen it. Acne scars are healing quickly, and my pores are looking more refined! I’ve never seen a product give me these kinds of results. I’m SO impressed. Not to mention, this product smells like watermelon jolly ranchers. It’s like HEAVEN. And, the texture is something I’ve never seen before. It’s like a watery jelly, and I really like it. It feels hydrating and allows my skin to just soak up my moisturizer. And it’s not super drying, either! I am so amazed by this product and would absolutely recommend it to anyone, especially those with oily, acne prone skin or those who have enlarged pores. OBSESSED!!!",1.0
Very hydrating. A little goes a long way! Absorbs nicely. Not greasy.,1.0
I loved this moisturizer! I’m very picky about which ones I like and I think this was great! It was not sticky or oily at all and when I woke up in the morning my skin looked and felt amazing! I would definitely buy the full size when I run out!,1.0
"I’m kind of on the fence about this moisturizer. I have combination skin, dry patches with an oily t-zone, so I use moisturizer every day. This one had an odd feel when applying it, almost like a firmness to it. It didn’t melt into my skin or go on super smooth, and I also felt like I had to use more of the product to apply it to my entire face. It is lightly scented not overpowering so that was nice. It was a sample size that only lasted a few applications so I can’t say that I truly noticed any difference that it made other than helping to alleviate some of the dryness. I will probably buy a full size jar so I can give it a thorough test, so definitely not a bad product.I received the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme complimentary in return for my honest opinion.",1.0
"Ok is the first time I use this type of patches and wow I have loved it, in short it has not completely removed the grain but if it has accelerated the healing process, it is incredible how fast it acts, I recommend it and I think it is very much worth it . I think the price is a little high but it brings enough patches. I think if you were a little bigger it would be better. I recommend it very much !!",1.0
"I got this as a sample the first time and liked it so much that I bought the jumbo. I have ichthyosis and dry, flaky, and acne prone skin, and so far, this cream has worked great for me. I love that it is a clean brand with recyclable packaging and no weird ingredients. It does have a particular smell, but I believe it’s because it’s fragrance free, so I’m happy with it. Be careful with the especially the jumbo size, especially because I dropped it on my tile, and it shattered 😬",1.0
"I have VERY oily, acne prone skin, so to be honest I was a little disappointed when I received this as a free sample from Influenster. Of course I tried it anyway and was quite nicely surprised. The scent is pleasant",1.0
My skin looks and feels amazing after using this product!,1.0
"I bought the little travel size mask that comes with the Lapiz oil to try them before getting the bigger sizes. After a week of using both as directed, my boyfriend (who, God love him, never even noticed if I go from blonde to red head), said “your face looks so clear and soft“. I almost fell over. Definitely gonna keep using.",1.0
"I was gifted by Sunday Riley Good Genes lactic acid treatment. I am really everything this serum is doing to my skin, I have sensitive skin but this product has done an amazing job on my skin. I use this serum thrice a week at night and I wake up with a brighter and baby soft skin every morning. This treatment deeply and gently exfoliates the dull surface of the skin for a clear, bright and radiant skin. I am using this to treat fine lines on my forehead and I am already happy with the results.",1.0
Absolutely worth it!,1.0
"Received a small sample jar. The texture, finish, and scent kind of reminds me of bad cold cream. The texture is thick but thins and spreads as it warms on the skin. Felt rather greasy after all. Moisturizes fine but not as well as I would like (I have normal skin). It didn’t do anything great to my skin but also didn’t break it out or irritate it either. The scent is vile, however. A cloying floral scent, which I hate (I’m picky about scents). Others may find the scent appealing but I wouldn’t dream of spending so much on a less-than- mediocre texture and moisturizing experience that also smells so bad. There are much better products out there.",0.0
"I’ve been using this product regularly for 12 days and I can say so far that it helps me controling on my skin sebum and gives me that glowy natural look that I truely love seeing on my face! And it helps me brightening my skin abit since I have dark spots from a very old break outs that I had 2 years ago but I still have a bit on my face so I can’t judge the whole product effectively since I only  used it for 12 days and the full result won’t come that ease , but one of the things that frustrate me abit that it doesn’t prevent new breakouts so while I’ve been using it I still have active pimples! Which why I was a bit frustrated counting the journey with this product but overall my skin loves it!",1.0
"I took one star off because the Gummy Bear scent is more artificial grape than anything (which I personally don’t mind, but just wanted to put it out there). I took another star off because this is most definitely overpriced. Does it work? Of course. It’s smooth and smells nice and leaves the lips hydrated. Could Aquaphor do the same exact thing? Most definitely. I enjoy the sweet scent and the amount of product I get the most. I will use the rest of this, but I don’t see myself purchasing again.",0.0
"Loving this eye cream! I’m already a huge fan of Sunday A+ High-Dose Retinol Serum and have gone through 4 bottles so was excited to see them come out with a retinol eye cream. Aging and crepey eyelids and crows feet are a big concern for me because I’m seeing that’s where my mom and grandmother have aged the most on their face, so I take eye cream very seriously. This product is a bit tacky and thicker in texture compared to their A+ Retinol Serum. It does not sweat into your eyes at all which is something that a lot of eye creams do and it burns but no issue with this one! It’s a bit strong, so I think will be good to use every other night.",1.0
"I love how my skin felt so soft when I took it off. The smeel is pretty subtle and I like that. A lot of cleansers make my skin feeling dry, this one not at all. I’m obsessed with it, thank you so much influenster for sending this to me, it’s one of the bests cleansers I’ve tried.",1.0
I absolutely love this product. It’s apart of my (depending on how my skin is that week) daily skin routine. Without this product my skin wouldn’t be so clear. Anytime I have any kind of break out this product is guaranteed to take it away and keep it away. I highly recommend it. It’s pricey but I promise it’s 100% worth it. I have normal/combination skin. I experience most breakouts in my cheek and jaw area due to maskne (acne from wearing a mask all the time). These wipes along with any face wash with benzoyl peroxide and proper moisture after will clear your skin.,1.0
"Loved this cleanser! It foams and smells refreshing. My face was visibly brighter. Only downside is they don’t offer an in between size from the sample. It lasted for months, which could work for some, but my skin enjoys frequently using different cleansers.",1.0
This is definitely in my top 5 products of all time. So lightweight but adds sooooo much hydration to the skin. I couldn’t live without it!,1.0
"I was really looking forward to this product, but unfortunately it really stings and irritates my skin. This was a surprise to me because I’m not usually a “sensitive skin” sort of person and have no known allergies. Clearly I am reacting to at least one of the ingredients though. Between the gold, botanicals and fragrance ingredients, something makes this is a no-go for me. With that said, the product’s application and texture feels like a dream. “Water Cream” is a good description. If you don’t suffer the same skin irritation, it may work well for you.",0.0
I received a sample size of the product and I love it! The product goes on so smooth and absorbs into the under eye without feeling sticky. I see results after a few weeks of using! A little goes a long way!,1.0
"I love the way this product smells! After I put it on my face, before my moisturizer, it makes my skin really soft. I currently have no complaints, I would recommend.",1.0
I’m really satisfied with the outcome :) it says you have to wait 6 hours but for me personally I saw it working in like 30 minutes. I would buy it again if my acne gets this bad again.,1.0
"A very good mask for picking up your skin when it needs a little TLC. I usually use this once a week or whenever I feel my skin is looking dull and congested. I have acne prone, combination skin. I usually apply a moderate layer on clean dry skin and keep it on overnight. It is absorbing and not tacky at all so no sticking on to pillow covers or hair. When I wash it off in the morning, I notice my skin is very radiant, glowy, hydrated and looks supple! I love that this is clean so I don’t need to be worried about harmful chemicals. I would definitely recommend this. Wish it wasn’t that pricey. The mini does go a long way.",1.0
"The formula in this lip balm is superb! I went out of town and forgot to pack my usual lip balm so I picked this up as a backup and it worked wonders on my chapped, winter lips! The smell is also divine- smells like caramel cookies. Highly recommend!",1.0
I thought maybe because my skin is dehydrated this product might work for my otherwise oily skin even though it is marketed for dry to normal. But nope. Oily is as oily does. It sat in my skin like a layer of cooking oil. It felt gross. Definitely not for oily skin even if you are dehydrated.,0.0
"I want to like the Supergoop sunscreens but they all contain Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octocrylene, and Octisalate which are all known toxic hormone disruptors. Not sure why it’s marked as “clean” when these are some of the worst ingredients in sunscreen. Besides that, I love the variety of styles/finishes",0.0
I really wanted to like this. I am giving it 3 stars because it did remove my eye makeup. However it left a residue on my face. When I used my toner afterwards I saw the remainder of my face makeup on the cotton pad. I tried this for a total of 3 weeks.,0.0
"I love this mask, it’s my favorite clay mask I’ve used. It works well, and a little goes a long way.",1.0
Absolutely gorgeous cleanser. Especially for skin prone to drying out. No complaints; the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because its dupe (Body Shop chamomile) is just as amazing.,1.0
So far so good. I’m glad I purchased 2,1.0
I revived this complimentary for review and it was a very ok moisturizer. It was very thin and gel like which is nice for oily skinned people but I wouldn’t call it a 100 hour super hydrator. Very ok not super expensive and does not irritate my skin.,1.0
"This is the only GLOW RECIPE product that I don’t like. More accurately, it’s the only one I can’t use. The skin around my eyes is just too sensitive for retinol, and the formula itself is very thick and pills easily. I hope the brand comes out with a second eye cream without retinol. That being said, please try other GLOW RECIPE products. This is an amazing brand.",0.0
"I really appreciate the great quality ingredients in this product. It’s so gentle and shouldn’t cause issues for you even if you have sensitive skin. Be careful to use this as directed as you don’t want to use it everyday to avoid potential issues with your skin. Instead just treat yourself to this facial twice a week and your skin will thank you. Be patient and really give this a good few months to see if you like how your skin is feeling after a good amount of time using this product in conjunction with other quality skincare products. Also be aware that there is fragrance in here. I personally like the fragrance as it’s kind of floral and sweet smelling. It reminds me of the Prada Candy perfume, but definitely not as intense. I did get this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes, however I am reviewing this completely honestly and pointing out some things that weren’t issues for me, but could be for someone else. I don’t have a ton of skin issues just the occasional blemish and some closed comedones on my forehead and hairline. I feel like it really smoothed out my skin’s texture as it has been the only thing I added to my normal skincare routine which consists only of CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer in the AM and PM.",1.0
"I have been using this for about one week now and I can already feel that my skin is smoother and way more hydrated. I use this product along with the Tonique Confort toner. I apply the toner first and then this moisturizer. I usually am not a fan of gel moisturizers because most feel like a blanket over the face. But, this moisturizer does not! It is absorbed by the skin and you can instantly feel the hydration. I also love the nice yet subtle smell. I received this product for free from Influenster for testing and review purposes.",1.0
"I love using the Daily Microfoliant gifted to me from Dermalogica on my skin every night in the shower. It cleanses and exfoliates at a level I never exfoliated before, leaving my skin smooth and soft to the touch.",1.0

"A great fresh clean, yet product feels like and soothing",1.0
"this product definitely keeps my skin hydrated and moisture locked in, but i really don’t like how sticky it is and how fast it gets sticky after applying. it also pills when i apply products after it if i don’t wait long enough for it to sink in, usually about 3-5 min. maybe i’m just impatient?? it’s not a big deal at night but very annoying when i’m rushing to get ready for work in the morning. i like how affordable it is but the cons outweigh the pros for me. i’ll stick to my tried and true innisfree green tea serum, which is more lightweight, NOT sticky, and keeps my skin just as hydrated.",0.0
"I absolutely love this product! I’ve been using it for the past 1 month and there has been significant improvement in the texture of my skin (I have acne pro skin) - less dark spots and more brightness. I have been also breaking out a lot less lately, but not sure if that’s entirely due to the product. I have noticed that my skin also responds really well if I use an overnight hydrating mask on the days when I don’t use it. | gifted by Sunday Riley",1.0
"I love this facial scrub! I use this scrub to wash my face and then I use a moisturizer right after and it leaves my skin feeling so soft! I also love how it is completely vegan and not tested on animals. The scent is amazing, it smells like fresh lemons. I would definitely recommend this product.",1.0
"I am a university student. When I tell you I have a lot of all nighters and nights where I only sleep 2 hrs a night, you would not believe me. This stuff is good! I also have eczema under my eyes year round and this has helped out a lot with dry patches. At first I thought I would not like the texture because it feels like silicone, but I don’t mind it anymore.",1.0
Not for acne prone skin or oily skin. Very greasy. Made me break out badly,0.0
I loved the texture of this product and the feeling the next morning! It was interesting to use a sleeping mask but it really helped my dry skin for the next day. Was very impressed with the scent and ease of use.,1.0
Love this and it smells sooo good. It leaves my skin soft and supple. I haven’t had dry skin since starting this,1.0
"I have been using this Clinique cleansing balm for around 3 months now.  I love it.  It takes off all of my makeup with ease, and I usually wear heavy makeup--a full face of foundation, powder, eyeshadow etc. I really love the consistency of this balm.  I have the Farmacy cleansing balm as well.  The Farmacy one is just as good for effectively removing makeup. They are as good as one another in the how well they work, but I prefer the consistency of the Clinique one over the Farmacy one.  The Clinique one is slightly thicker and is silkier.  They really are so similar, that it’s really just personal preference which someone prefers. But for me I have rebought this one and always reach for this one first. It’s a great product.",1.0
"I enjoy the fresh, watermelon scent. It feels hydrating and refreshing. I did not notice a change in pores, or the appearance of them, but it helped keep my complexion looking nice, with no irritation.",1.0
Fantastic! I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin after adding this to my daily routine. Definitely worth a try.,1.0
"Wasn’t compatible with my skin, so returned. Warning: contains citrus oils (essential oils)! It smells kind of like citrus sorbet when you open it and the fragrance gets stronger when applying to face. Packaging is of good quality and includes an applicator that is held by the plastic layer under the lid. The texture is like that of the usual cleansing balm, melts and applies smoothly. Sadly, it contains polyethylene, a plastic. #3",0.0

To start off, I have normal to oily skin which is a little acne prone. It feels super smooth when I put it on and leaves my skin glowy. It acted as a nice base to my makeup as well, which is important to me. This moisturizer is very hydrating and has a nice scent to it. I also love the packaging!!",1.0
"Personally not my favorite moisturizer from tatcha. Literally is a “water cream” though. As soon as the moisturizer touched my skin it felt like water, which some people might like but I prefer a thicker consistency and something that doesn’t just soak in right away.",0.0
After a week of using this every morning (under sunscreen,1.0
"A clean and thin application, great formula, and reminds me of the tatcha water cream. Wasn’t really what I was looking for though, as I didn’t love that one either. I feel like it would sit nicely under makeup but I didn’t feel it did much for my skin",1.0
"I have massive pores that tend to get clogged and congested, resulting in closed comedones and this serum is a MIRACLE worker! My pores are barely noticeable, my oil is controlled, and my skin barrier looks and feels super healthy. I don’t get tons of acne when I use this product, and my makeup application looks a THOUSAND times better because of how much it minimizes pores. I didn’t realize how important a serum could be in terms of making my makeup last and look it’s best. This serum ensures that I’m working with a smooth, poreless canvas. Definitely a permanent staple for me!",1.0
"This lotion is ok I guess... it is runny so you can spread a small amount on a large surface and it also works well on top of serums and under makeup. However, my skin didn’t feel moisturized although my forehead got quite oily looking throughout the day. I have dry, sensitive skin and I didn’t feel like I got enough moisture with this cream. Also, it stung every time I applied it, so there are some harsh ingredients in it, for sure. Overall it is an ok cream, probably good for normal non-sensitive skin types. One deluxe sample that lasted me a couple of weeks was enough for me to decide not to purchase the full size.",0.0
Love this moisturizer. Very light weight and creamy,1.0
"I have been anxious to find a great exfoliant for my skin. FOUND it , it meshed well with my skincare routine! I can already see results of adding exfoliant into my skincare routine.

"This is lightweight and sinks into skin quickly. It wears well under both liquid and powder foundations and doesn’t pill. However, after using this for months, I have seen zero change in my pores. I also wish it were more moisturizing. It doesn’t do much to refresh my dry/combo skin.",0.0
Super hydrating! Love the smell & all you need is 10 mins and it keeps your under eye super hydrated. Definitely will recommend. Will buy this again!!!!,1.0
"Not good for acne prone skin. It makes me break out every time I used it. overall is a good product. Is more like a smart foundation, the green color adapts to tour skin tone.",1.0
"Worked great. I received this as a sample so only had one use, but it left my skin soft and smooth. I wish it wasn’t as expensive, but a great product if you can afford it.",1.0
I really like this moisturizer for wearing under makeup. I am not as much of a fan when using it without makeup. I find it doesn’t fully dry down/soak into the skin which is maybe why makeup sticks to it so well. It provides a lovely base for my foundation but I feel sticky if I don’t apply anything overtop.,1.0
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT MADE MY SKIN FEEL SO AMAZING! BEST OF ALL I GOT IT FREE!,1.0
I’ve been using this product for over 2 years now. I love how it’s soft enough that I can use it for my morning and night cleanse yet strong enough to keep my face clean. This works well with my combination/sensitive skin.,1.0

I have pretty oily skin, but this doesn’t get it in the way or cause my skin to overproduce oil!",1.0

"The first time I applied it, the tingling was intense, and the finish a bit sticky... but when I woke up, my skin was so smooth, glowy, and not greasy. This is the first product I have ever used that makes me feel that way when I wake up. The tingling has been mild the next days, and still getting awesome results, just as expected. I  have also tried the T.L.C from DE, but I feel this gives me better results, and of course the price point is much better. Love this and will repurchase.",1.0
Lightweight texture and fast absorption. It nice and hydrating without making my skin feel sticky. It also aided in clearing my acne which is amazing. My skin nice and glowy too,1.0
"The cold plunge pore mask is a very refreshing mask! I have included it in my morning routine at least 2 - 3 times a week.

I have seen a very slight improvement with my redness... I’m still on the fence about buying another bottle of this, I only have 1/4 of the bottle left which seems like I’ve gone through a lot for $56 using this once a day.  While I do like the pump for controlling the amount, the pump is starting to break and stick down. The packaging is super cute, and it smells really fresh.",1.0
"I was so excited to try this product! I did a good amount of research, because I don’t like wasting my money, and for a small jar of this to be $30 I want it to be completely worth it. I gave this two stars because it goes on really nice and feels soft, but lately my skin has been dry (when it’s normally pretty oily), and this product made it worse. I started to get dry patches and little red bumps, which meant that my make- up went on pretty awful as well. Also, after applying I felt that it felt good for just a few minutes and then my skin felt dry again. Overall, I was not impressed and felt that it definitely did nothing for my skin. I will be returning.",0.0
I am obsessed!! I love this product. I mix it in every other day with my face lotion. So far so good on causing any extra break outs. Very impressed.,1.0
"This product was gifted to me by Glow Recipe and Octoly.I will be honest, the thought of an Avocado eye cream did not sound super appealing to me, but thank goodness the scent of this is very light and fresh, nothing too strong or avocado-ey. Now that I’m thinking about it, I’m not sure Avocado really has a distinctive scent to me...hmm...It has been a long time since I have purchased an eye cream, mainly because I wasn’t really seeing a difference, atleast no more of a difference than just using my regular skincare. I also do not set my concealer with powder, so to avoid creasing I do not apply anything to my undereye during the day. However, this eye cream has started to change my mind.It has a very weightless formula that absorbs quickly, so I am able to put concealer over it (atleast with the ones I’ve used recently, which have been more matte). And as for the retinol, that is something that is going to take time to see results but I haven’t notice any sort of dryness that typically comes with retinol/retin-a.The packaging is very beautiful, heavy duty glass jar that comes with a baby spoon (anyone else just fawn over little silverware?). I definitely prefer a product with a pump or that can be squeezed, but I atleast appreciate the spoon...which sadly has already been lost... Overall I have really been enjoying this product, but its too soon so say if its something I would repurchase.",1.0
"Absolutely love. Light pink sheeny tint, very hydrating and not too sticky. Great for everyday and applicator is easy to use/doesn’t dispense too much.",1.0
Amazing texture and good hudration! Love how fast it absorbs. It was the only cream that didn’t burn my skin after using retinol for a few days. It really feels “clean”.,1.0
"Not at all worth the price, heavy on fragrance, and it left me with more of a greasy feel.",0.0
Purchased this after my Perk facial and I’m obsessed. My own boyfriend comments after I apply that I’m glowing!!!,1.0
I absolutely love the Sunday Riley Good Genes All in one lactic acid treatment. I actually received this complimentary from Sunday Riley in return for a review of my honest opinion. At first I wasn’t sure if it would be something that would work for me but I am so beyond pleased with it that it has became part of my daily routine. It’s so easy to use. All I have used is about two pumps of it and it covers my whole face perfectly. I absolutely love the scent of it as it smells really fresh and not to potent to be on your face! It’s great! I have noticed that my face isn’t looking as dull as it was before and it’s really brightened up and my pores are seeming to be smaller and less visible like before. I am so pleased and feel like I look so much better than before I began using it!,1.0
I loved this product it removes my mascara instantly and i’ve always struggled to find a product to really remove my mascara and finally i found it. DEFINITELY BUY THIS,1.0
Love this. It makes my skin feel super hydrated and protected. Almost leaves it feeling like a silicone primer but I follow up with a second cleanse. On the nights I want to slug but feel to lazy then I use this second and it feels sort of similar to me.,1.0
"I received this product a few weeks ago from Influenster for my honest review.  This product claims to give more supple skin, reduce dullness and make skin smoother.  I don’t know if it made my skin smoother but it did take away dullness and my skin felt fresh and renewed.  Idk if my skin is more supple but when I applied moisturizer my skin seemed to absorb it better.  I do like this essence and im glad it doesn’t have an offensive scent I barely smell anything. I’ve only tried one other essence and the scent was too strong for me to like.  I do recommend this essence.",1.0
"Love this, sometimes it’s a little rough, but I add a little water to dial down the sensation. My skin is so smooth after each use. I’m addicted to the results and smell.",1.0
This cream is heavenly. Goes on smoothly and I feel it soaks into my skin. Feels natural as well. A heavier cream. I do notice it helps soften fine lines even after a week! Scent is quite neutral and natural which I appreciate too. I got this gifted by La Mer for my honest feedback.,1.0
"I really wanted to hate this because it is SO expensive. But after trying a tiny sample, I had to order the real thing. I have no regrets. This product is completely worth the hype.I have oily/combo VERY acne-prone skin, and I’ve never found a moisturizer that really works for me. I’ve been using the Effaclar and it’s fine-ish, but still wasn’t really doing what I wanted it to, but it wasn’t breaking me out so I took it. For all of my high school years and much of my college years (I’m 22 now), I didn’t even use moisturizer because I was sick of dealing with the struggle of finding one that didn’t make me oily or break me out. This is perfect. It absorbs right into the skin, moisturizes effectively, doesn’t break me out, and provides a good base for foundation. I noticed immediately when I started using it that my face was significantly less oily throughout the day when I used this moisturizer in the morning. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to turn back.",1.0
"I absolutely love this product! I got this complimentary product from Influenster and it smells so good, I actually wanted to eat it. The product looks amazing as well, I love the pink tone and it turns into a white shade when the product is activated! The PHAT facial was great! It left my skin feeling soft and smooth as well as exfoliated! I did not notice my pores as much as I would with other exfoliates and products so this was perfect.",1.0
I’m all for luxe products but I really didn’t notice a difference using this. It also has a fermented smell to me that I find odd and I usually can tolerate fragrances. It’s refreshing and gentle and evens your skin tone but nothing worth $99 for a MINI size.,0.0
Anything Tatcha is a win! I have combination skin so it’s great for midday when my face starts to look a little dry but it’s also NOT super greasy- just hydrates the skin❤️,1.0
"I received this product for free to try. It has a nice consistency and is lightweight. However, I did not notice any significant difference.... Not sure that it’s worth the price.",0.0
Its a free sample but I’m really thinking about to buy one ♥️ I love how good my skin feels after using it and the effect lasts for hours,1.0
Love this.. I have beautiful full lips but I  getting older and am starting to worry about lines. This feels so luscious without being sticky or tacky. Feels so silky. I love it. My BF also noticed the difference since I started using it at night,1.0
"At first I was hesitant that this pricey lipmask would be worth it, but I am so glad that I tried it. The smell is a delicious berry scent and it glides on like a rich cream. You can use it as a daily lip balm if you want or just the night mask. I both purchased a full sized one from Sephora but also received a free sample size (perfect for travel) to review from Influenster.",1.0
Moisturizes very well. My skin was glowing after using. I definitely would purchase this product again.,1.0
"I received this product as a free sample. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream has literally helped to keep my skin moisturized, soft, and youthful looking during the day to day weather changes that happen in the Midwest.I love how this cream is lightweight but thick. I can feel it working on and beneath my skin. This cream also helps my skin have a nice natural glow to it. There is no noticeable scent (which is perfect). A little goes a long way.",1.0
"I’m a big fan of The Ordinary so thought I’d try the moisturizer. My skin is on the drier side and this lotion was not very hydrating. It is okay given the price tag, but will not buy this again.",0.0
"I’ve been using this toner for almost a year now and it’s absolutely amazing. It’s great for smoothing our textured skin. Also, whenever I have a stubborn breakout that won’t go away, I use this toner every night for a few days and it clears right up. Also you get a giant bottle for less than $10 which is a total steal. The Ordinary products are my little secret for keeping my skin clear (although it’s not much of a secret since I tell everyone about it!).",1.0
"The serum has a milky consistency that feels lightweight and absorbs quickly with no tackiness. The formula is gentle so I don’t have to worry about layering or mixing it with other active serums in the morning and evening. For those who are sensitive to fragrances in their skincare, this does have a strong herbal eucalyptus-esque scent, which I personally find soothing and it has never irritated my sensitive skin. This layers beautifully, and leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated.",1.0
"In search of a great face wash, and will prob keep looking after I’ve used this all up. it’s not terrible by any means, and does give a fresh feeling.  It also doesn’t dry or strip the skin , but leaves it comfortable. It’s a runny gel consistency and doesn’t lather or foam very much.   I also notice a film when rinsing and find myself using a towel afterwards to remove it. My skin does feel pretty good though so a mixed review. Don’t love it and don’t hate it ,was honestly just expecting something more amazing considering the reviews.",1.0
This serum is best for dry skin it’s absorbed quickly and after that your skin feels so soft and glowing,1.0
"The double serum is amazing! I never would’ve tried it before because of how expensive it is but now I’m wondering - maybe it’s worth it! It’s so good!! I love the texture, the scent, the way it makes my face glow & feel moisturized. I only wish this wasn’t only a sample! I need the full size!",1.0
I really loved this product and the way it made my skin feel. I struggle with dry and patchy skin at times and just after one use I really saw a difference in my skin. I will be purchasing this!,1.0
"I absolutely love this product! I use it every night before bed. I also, use it as a lip gloss and even over lipstick. It so moisturizing and makes your lips look full and plump. Such a great product!",1.0
I used this for a week straight and the overall difference in the texture of my skin is so prominent!! I love that the oil is not heavy on my skin especially since I have oily skin. I love it so much!,1.0
"This eye cream is super hydrating and a little goes a long way. It’s very heavy so I would only recommend it for night time use, as it may be too oily to put makeup under. It’s great for hydration and if dry crepey under eyes are an issue for you. I will use this up but I probably won’t be buying again because I prefer eye creams that have anti-aging benefits.I received this item free for my review",1.0
Absolutely 0 complaints. This is my new favorite moisturizer. I pair it with the cleanser and these two are unstoppable. My skin has never looked or felt better thanks to these products. Amazed,1.0
"Great moisturizer, if you use combined with the toner you’ll see the results instantly!",1.0
"I got a trial of this with one of my orders and the results were unbelievable. I have struggled with acne and breakouts my entire life. I’m 27 now and even as an adult it’s rare to not have a single breakout. After using this trial size my skin was glowing and had NO blemishes. It wasn’t until I stopped using it and started to break out again that I made the connection. The price is scary but I’ve always wanted clear skin and I’ve never felt more confident about my skin until using this. I bit the bullet - plus, a little bit does go a long way!",1.0
Just off the first use my skin is super super smooth and is not dried out. And my spots on my face with the worst acne looks better just in color alone. Can’t wait to see the long term affect of this product!,1.0
"I usually don’t write reviews but this product was too incredible not to! I have struggled with beyond dry and flaky skin for several years now. I have went to dermatologists, shaved my face, used every moisturizer and moisturizing product I could find and none really helped. A Sephora employee actually suggested this to help with the flaky skin, and I figured why not. Best decision EVER! It is so gentle but packs a punch. Besides helping solve my dry skin my skin is now glowing, evenly colored, texture is so much nicer and make up application a thousand times easier. This product is now a staple in my skin care. If you’re debating- just give it a try!",1.0
Stocking up on these each time I’m in store/ making an order. I keep a mini pack in each of my make up bags. Refreshing and they leave my face feeling great! Added note: the scent is wonderful too!,1.0
"I freaking love this moisturizer. This moisturizer and Cerave’s are the only ones that don’t break my sensitive, acne prone skin out. I’m very picky on what I use for obvious reasons, but this works and keeps my skin hydrated and soft. Really helps with acne because dryness leads to more pimples. I absolutely love it, would highly recommend to any acne prone/sensitive girlies and guys.",1.0
"After a return trip from the tropics, my face was scaly and very dry (no sunburn). After telling the beauty advisor of my concerns she recommended this. I am on day 4 of consistent use (2x a day) and my skin has seen a huge improvement! I will keep this product in heavy rotation. And what a great price. You literally only need the pea size amount as stated on the bottle.",1.0
Bought this bc Caroline Hirons raves about it. It is meh. Not super moisturizing so it could be good for daytime except that it pulls under makeup. Not moisturizing enough for night. I’m mixing with oil at night to use it up but will not repurchase.,0.0
"Amazing product, I love it . My skin looks so much better. I received this product as a sample and became very obsessed with the product. Highly recommend!!",1.0
"Caffeine for your eyes? Yes please! This product has been awesome for my dark circles and as a momma of two littles, the shadows are definitely there. If you’re looking for something to help with bags or wrinkles, this isn’t the product for you (the Ordinary has other products for that) but if you’re looking to focus on your dark circles I believe this is worth a try for sure. The bottle also lasts forever as you only need a super small amount. It also helps that their products are so affordable! So if it’s not the HG product for you, at least your only out a couple of dollars.... or a cup of coffee if you will.",1.0
"I kind of feel cheated by IT Cosmetics. This is NOT matte, and extremely similar to their original CC cream. The texture is slightly different and the coverage less, so I’m not crazy about the fact that I bought this expecting matte and it’s not matte at all. This is dewey, and compared to the original, the coverage is a bit less and the finish less airbrushed.",0.0
"I used to use this product 6 ish years ago, then I stopped for some reason. I rediscovered it 6 months ago and have used nothing else since. This helped my dry, dehydrated, sensitive skin feel spump and hydrated without breaking me out.",1.0
Absolutely love this! Makes your lips feel so good,1.0
"I have a nice glow with this and it makes my skin look better without any make up. It is glow, so I would keep that in mind if you have oily skin, like I do. I tend to through a little translucent powder on my t-zone (mainly forehead) to tone down the shine a little.",1.0
"My eyes really saw a difference after using the wrinkle correcting eye cream, droopiness seemed to disappear with ease. It did not irritate my eyes either.",1.0
My all time favorite mask! I am on my 3rd jar and each jar last me at least a year. My skin always suffers when I run out so I always repurchase right away. It’s so good!,1.0
"Great moisturizer, definitely helps keep my skin hydrated.",1.0
"Finding a face wash that works for your skin is hard! So happy I found the jelly cleanser, my skin feels clean and fresh! No irritations and keeps most of my blemishes at bay, while not over drying my skin",1.0
This is the best exfoliant you will ever use. I am 59 years old and it makes me feel 40! It is worth the investment.,1.0
"This is my first time using cleansing balm and since this is an oil cleanser, I follow up with a water based cleanser of my choice. I noticed my skin feels super clean and baby soft than when I would only use a water based cleanser.",1.0
"I purchased this product as I was experiencing very dry skin under my eyes.  One of the gals at Sephora suggested it.  I been using faithfully, day and night, for almost 2 weeks and it has worked!  My under eye area is moisturized and looks brighter.  Im very happy I purchased.  However, I only gave it 4 stars as it’s a bit expensive.  If you can afford, I highly recommend.",1.0
"Amazing cleansing balm!  I’ve tried many kinds, and the consistency and effectiveness of this one has them all beat!  I love that it comes with it’s own mini spatula - this keeps everything cleaner, and allows for easy measuring. Just a small scoop is plenty - the balm melts as soon as it hits the skin into a thin, creamy oil, and dissolves all my face and eye makeup quickly and easily. It has a gentle, fresh scent - almost none at all. It doesn’t sting my eyes or make my eyes cloudy afterwards like some other thicker balms do. And it rinses cleanly along with all the makeup!  I personally follow this with a regular foaming cleanser to completely cleanse the skin, but this does the first step of removing my makeup just perfectly - absolutely no complaints here!",1.0
"I am so happy with this purchase. The formula is great and makes my skin glow. Noticed a positive change after a few days using it twice a day. The only thing is it’s not the most pleasant smell, but it’s not too noticeable.",1.0
"J’adore. Le maquillage s’enlève facilement, doux et non irritant pour la peau et même pour les yeux. Moins graisseux que je croyais.",1.0
Love this face wash! Rinses off clean and makes my skin feel fresh and not tight at all,1.0
I received this complimentary from influenster. I have oily skin and this worked really great. Absorbs well into the skin without feeling greasy or leaving any residue. Happy to have this and will continue to use it!,1.0
"I was very excited to get  gifted  by La Mer,  Creme de la Mer because I’ve read great reviews in past. I’m happy I wasn’t let down. The texture was rich and it left my skin moisturized. The scent was nice and subtle which I love. Now I get the hype.",1.0
I am a two step cleanse girl and have been for years.  Tatcha has perfected the process and streamlined it down to one step with the same amazing results!  I am constantly being amazed by the performance of all the products that I have tried thus far from this line.  Total addiction for sure!,1.0
"I have combo skin and it’s so hard to find a good moisturizer to fit for not being too oily or too dry, but this moisturizer is amazing. It gives a soft nice glow but doesn’t make me look greasy. 12/10 recommend.",1.0
"I needed a gentle exfoliation product for  my super sensitive, very temperamental skin,  and a Sephora employee recommended these pads.  So far, so good.  My skin is soft and happy.  Delighted that these seem to have squashed the minor acne I’ve dealt with on and off since my teens.",1.0
"Yes. It is an amazing product, but it has a cheap baby cream smell that I dislike as it reminds me of a cheap product, it also gives me this greasy feeling on my face for the first 15 minutes of application. That goes away, so it’s all good I guess. I researched a lot before I purchased this, as it’s very pricey. A lot of people swore by it, other people said is overpriced for what it is, so I took a chance and I bought the small one (Still $85 dollars!) My boyfriend takes care of his skin a lot and he started to use it as well, he LOVES IT so I guess we are buying the big one next time.",1.0
Yess ! First clay mask that I actually like ! Doesn’t smell weird like the others and is easy to wipe off with water and leaves my skin feeling smooth !,1.0
"Love the packaging, feel, smell. I just wish it was a bit more coarse / exfoliating. Similar in texture to baking soda but less coarse. Probably better suited to sensitive skin. I use retin a and it was not “scrubby” enough to remove all peelies. Great if you’re looking for a gentle cleanse but not a true scrub.",1.0
"Thick consistency that melts like butter onto the skin and slowly seeps in. Leaves the skin dewy but not glowy. I can say by the end of the day my skin still felt hydrated and sis not appear dry at all! Only reason I took off 1 star was because of the rose scent: it’s not a favourite of mine, personal preferences.",1.0
"I really like this, I tend to have dry skin and this added moisture and made my skin really smooth! I did recieve this product for free through influencter for testing but I would def recommend",1.0
This is a great product. It goes on so smooth and leaves the skin soft. The cream is light weight and not heavy nor greasy. It quickly and easily absorbs into the skin. I would recommend this product.  I am ready to see what the long term usage results in. I love this jar.  It looks like a diamond or a piece of jewelry.  I will be keeping the jar when the product is gone.,1.0
"Love, love, love this hyaluronic acid and its price point. I use the product day and night right after washing my face/neck  as a base to lock in the moisture. My skin feels super hydrated and glowy. The product is a bit sticky, but I don’t have an issue with it since most other hyaluronic acids that I’ve tried have similar consistency that acts like a gel. I would definitely recommend storing to product in the fridge for full potential!",1.0
Was super excited for this considering how there were many good reviews . I gave this a try three times and all three times it left my eyes super itchy and dry. It would cause redness around the entire eye area and leave tiny bumps. Going to be returning this. In search for a good eye cream again.,0.0
I love it . It’s a buttery but quick observing and light weight cream which gives u immediate sense of moisture and freshness despite I got it from influenster for free I am totally down to including it in my daily routine,1.0
"I have dry skin that gets really flakey and looks really crusty. This cleanser has never dried out my skin or made it feel tight after use -- it actually makes my skin feel hydrated. It’s very gentle, and I haven’t had major breakouts since incorporating it into my skincare routine. Also, right after I rinse it off, I IMMEDIATELY notice that my skin looks brighter. Never had that happen to me with a cleanser before. It smells super nice (although if you don’t like fragrance, just know that it has fragrance), the consistency is great, and it foams up really nicely. Definitely gonna become a staple in my skincare routine! Also, my boyfriend has normal skin, and he also loves using it, since it works well for his skin type too!",1.0
"This is my second time purchasing this product, if you are looking for a good niacinimide product I highly recommend. It’s good for sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. It’s not sticky when dry eaither.",1.0
Great product even with my sensitive skin! Safe enough to use everyday.,1.0
Love this moisturizer. I have combo skin and lately my skin has been very dry in certain areas. After using this product for one week my skin has been more hydrated and less oily. It also did not break me out. It does have a fragrance but it is a very minimal smell and it smells pretty good. I noticed there is a slight shimmer finish to it after applying it to the skin but I do not mind. This is worth every penny and I will forever be a fan of this product and Tatcha.,1.0
"Bought this serum after doing extensive research on a hydrating serum to incorporate into my skin routine and so happy with this so far. I have sensitive skin and hormonal acne concerns and I have noticed a huge difference in using the serum for a few weeks now in the plumpness, smoothness and even texture my skin now has. It’s safe to use with my glycolic serum and my vitamin C cream, so a great addition to the routine so far. I use it at least once a day and it is working!",1.0
"I have tried HUNDREDS of moisturizers, and no one could seem to recommend one for sensitive, extra dry t zone / dry skin generally but this is AMAZING.I pair this with my ole henriksen vitamin c serum and this moisturizer and i’m set for the day!It has very little smell which I love, but still smells good. It also is thicker and cool so it gives irritated skin a nice chunk of relief.100% recommend, I got it as a sample with drunk elephant and other stuff, but this one truly caters to all dry types, not mature dry skin or anything, JUST EVERYONE ❤️",1.0
I have re purchased these several times- they are great for sensitive skin and smell like a dream.,1.0
"Pros: Went on smooth and easy. Felt light and didn’t make my face feel sticky, even on the hottest summer nights. Was gentle and didn’t irritate my skin. My skin looked pretty good in the morning after wearing this. A little went a long way!Cons: the smell reminded me of pickles, which wasn’t very sexy for a night cream. My wrinkles didn’t seem to improve after two weeks of use.",1.0
I travel a lot for work and this product has been a great add. 4 stars because i find it doesn’t absorb super well but it is great for blending with other products and on really dry skin. I like to use it at night along with another serum,1.0
I love this product it hydrates my skin so much and doesn’t leave a greasy residue!I did receive this complimentary and for testing purposes.,1.0
This toner is great you can definitely tell a difference with your skin when using it over time. My skin looks glowy healthy and bright when I use this!,1.0
"I can’t believe I’m going to say this but,I actually prefer Belif Aqua Bomb over my beloved long-time fave Creme de la Mer or Mario Badescu’s Moisture Magnet. This Aqua Bomb is whipped smooth, so incredibly hydrating and physically cool!! I have dry skin",1.0
I’ve been using this spot remover for about 2 weeks and have noticed a huge difference. Since the pandemic has started my face is breaking out due to the constant mask wearing. (Even with washing my face daily) this has helped tremendously with getting rid of those problem acne spots. Feels great on my skin and not sticky like some products similar to this one I have used before. Would highly recommend!! I received this product for free from BZZAGENT to sample and my opinions are my own.,1.0
Love this cleanser. Feels so silky smooth on my skin and doesn’t strip away moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this has never irritated me at all.,1.0
This product wasn’t even hydrating!!  It sat on top of my lips and DRIED THEM OUT!  Def not what you want in a lip balm!,0.0
"I love this moisturizer. It is the best one I have ever used. It never leaves your face feeling greasy, it just hydrates it. I highly recommend it.",1.0
(complimentary from Peace Out Skin Care) I love the Peace Out Skin Care pimple patches so I was excited to try this retinol eye stick. There is definitely a nice ease to the product and it goes on smoothly! I am not sure if I see any miracle work yet but I am excited to keep using it and see!,1.0
"This oil cleanser is the best. Takes absolutely no time to do this soon care regime. My skin feels soft, and smooth.",1.0
"Ok, this moisturizer is AMAZING!!! I have searched far and wide for a moisturizer that I don’t feel the need to reapply and that truly helps my skin and this is it!!! I have never used Sunday Riley products before and have now had the pleasure of trying out 2, and am thrilled.The Ice ceramide moisturizing cream is super thick, and takes very little to fully cover your face and neck. It absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel. It has a light, but pleasant scent to it. It comes with a small spatula/spoon in the packaging to keep you from having to dip into the jar. The jar packaging is nice, I love the frosted glass.Since using the cream provides all day moisture and makes a smooth base before applying makeup. My skin is much softer since I’ve began using. At 46, I’m starting to notice lots of imperfections on my face, not just fine lines and wrinkles, and this cream has helped dramatically on some of the smaller imperfections. I’m very excited to see what benefits I will see with long term use.This is my new go to for face moisturizer, I will continue using the Ice ceramide cream.",1.0
This mask is THE TRUTH - work up to once or twice a week if you have sensitive skin but it really works.,1.0
"I am giving this a 3 because it does a good job of moisturizing but I hate the smell , it reminds me of Noxzema cream.",0.0
This stuff combined with the Niacinamide has transformed my skin. My skin is so even and radiant: I’ve noticed a reduction in my pores and overall oiliness. This will be a product I will never go without!,1.0
this is really good product and also affordable.....i saw very good results.,1.0
Do not use with suggested toner!You should not mix vitamin c and AHA it changes the ph making it it ineffective I did think my skin looked hydrated in the morning but I found it to be uncomfortable even when using a small amount and I didn’t like the thought of it getting on my pillow.,0.0
"These are my go to face wipes, they leave my skin feeling clean and not oily, and the light scent of coconuts is very nice.",1.0
Love this! Definitely agree it’s more of a candy smell than caramel but I feel like it’s one of the best lip balms. I used to love the Dior creme de Ross. But this one may beat it. Only had it for a week. But it definitely moisturizes!,1.0
Very smooth and easy to use. No harsh scent. Feels good on the skin,1.0
Love this product! I received this from my Sephora rewards a while back and I’m happy I go the full size. It’s hydrating but doesn’t make my skin too oily which is great. Very refreshing and cooling also!,1.0
I received the sample for my honest word opinion. Since it was a smaller size I was able to use for about a week. It is a thick moisturizer that goes on easily my skin was soft after as well as in the morning when I woke up. I would recommend this to a friend and I would also buy this product myself,1.0
"This cleanser is a nice consistency and I appreciate the lack of fragrance. really wanted to like this, but it’s made an entire portion of my chin break out into small, fungal-like pimples after a few weeks of use :(",0.0
Advanced Night Repair is amazing. I have been using it for a week and I can see the difference in my skin. This product provides hydration for my skin and I can see the results. I really like that my skin feels more soft and hydrate. I have been using it right after I clean my face before going to bet. I have received this free product from influenster for testing purposes. I have decided to buy it now!,1.0
I was so excited to try this product but it gave me terrible breakouts all over. If you have sensitive skin I don’t recommend using this product.,0.0
"I was gifted by Glow Recipe to try out their new product. First of all, I love the signature watermelon scent. Secondly, I like the texture itself, which is not too thick or watery. It is a very lightweight serum and absorbs quickly. I layer it before moisturizer in my AM routine. I like how it gives me the glowy hydration. I have problems with acne dark spots so I am loving the niacinamide ingredients which can help to reduce hyperpigmentation and also minimize pores. I definitely will stick with this serum in my skincare routine.",1.0
"This cream was too heavy for my combination skin, and caused me to break out in small bumps. I’m sure it would work great for someone with a ton of dryness or eczema, but it wasn’t for me. I’ve been trying a moisturizer from Belif that is better suited for me I think!",1.0
This sunscreen is very nice. It goes in smooth and I feel moisturized and not greasy. I feel protected from the Sun.,1.0
"Smell is really good. It moisturizes for the moment, however it’s not long lasting",1.0
Not moisturising at all! A 3 dollar pharmacy chapstick does a much better job. What a disappointment and waste of money...,0.0
"I enjoy this cream for night. I was worried that it wouldn’t work out since its geared toward dry skin, and I decided to purchase the full size. My skin is normal but I get slightly oily in between my brows, top of forehead, and center of nose. Despite this, it’s been working great! It gives deep hydration and a very dewy look. And like the water cream I use for daytime, a minimal amount of product goes a long way, and I don’t have to use extra like my previous night cream. In the morning I can tell my skin feels perfectly hydrated and smooth (I still do a gentle cleanse with the camellia oil). I have noticed it takes a while to absorb but that’s not a problem. At night I use makeup remover, then Tatcha deep cleanse, sometimes the classic rice polish, then witch hazel as toner, this cream, eye cream, and finally two drops organic argan oil.",1.0
"Amazing scent, amazing texture, amazing moisturizer. I received this product for free to test from Influenster but have already purchased the full size because I loved it. It’s great to leave on over night but I also use it throughout the day as it’s not overly oily and really soaks into my lips.",1.0
It makes taking off your makeup so much fun. It hasn’t caused me any break outs. Does leave skin a little dry after though.,1.0
Love! I received this complimentary from influenster to sample. I loved this product. It made my lips super soft and hydrated. Easy to use and effective!,1.0
I recieved Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream as a complimentary from skinfix and I fell in love! I love the way the pump keeps it sealed and gives me the right amount each time. The cream itself does not leave a greasy feel yet hydrates my skin and in just a few applications I see a difference. I will be adding it to my routine as winter is right around the corner. Definitely recommend it!,1.0
Too much hype over this brand. This is a regular lip balm....Nothing special. Lips felt the same. There are other brands that really work. And there is nowhere to put the golden ladle....Disappointed..Will not purchase again....,0.0
I am enjoying using the belif True Cream Moisturizing Bomb. I’ve been using it once a day for 1 week and the results are moderate but visible. My face feels much smoother and look a little bit more glowing. I will continue to use the products. I can’t wait to see the results. I received this product free as part of a Influenster campaign VBox.,1.0
"My sensitive skin is a fan! After just a few days I’d use, I could feel and see a difference in my skin!",1.0
"Best high-end sunscreen I’ve tried! Makes me want to wear it every day. Overall, it provides a dewy glow (nothing metallic) and the shine can be easily layered. It’s also great to layer makeup on top of. I think it’s worth the money and is great for sensitive skin as well.",1.0
"I like this resurfacing serum, it does what it says, there is a tingling sensation, but nothing major. My skin is feeling and looking really nice",1.0
I love Fresh products and this one didn’t disappoint. The texture feels more gel like at first but it melts and glides onto your skin. It feels great to use especially at night and it feels luxurious. The scent is super subtle. I enjoy this product a lot. I received this complimentary from Fresh.,1.0
"I have this product as a sample first and I decided to bring it with me to my Aruba trip. Safe to say for a person like me, I only wear minimal makeup, and a little use of this product does remove all my makeup. I like this product enough that I have purchased a full size one.I would repurchase it again.",1.0
"Im in love with this, trying to keep my skincare routine to a minimum, this has cleared my acne scars, and balanced my face tone.",1.0
"This toner is gentle, good for everyday use of necessary skin. My skin is very sensitive despite being oily.  I can’t use a lot of toners because they dry my ski out too much (all the Clinique toners are way too strong for me and we’re actually causing me to break out).  I use at night every other day and my skin has been clearing up and smoothing out.  I had a bunch of small pimples but they are now resolving.  After this toner I use pure Shea butter and coconut oil on my face and neck.  I want to see how my skin does long term, but so far, it’s looking good.  I took pictures of both of my cheeks - pretty clear.  I’m 46 with oily / sensitive skin.",1.0
I was gifted this product and I’m loving it so far! My skin felt so smooth and dewy after a couple of uses!,1.0
This is a really good toner for oily skin. It is a little tacky but it really cleans my pores out. It smells like a watermelon with spice mixed together. I actually really like it. I will keep buying this toner as it really makes my skin look great and has cleared up some dark spots.,1.0
I have been looking for a food moisturizer for a while now and this has won it for me. Absolutely perfect.I have very sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate it but this doesn’t,1.0

"So far, so good.  Definitely brightening up my eyes. I didn’t have much for bags to begin with but any I did or normally get are now nonexistent.  Feels cool to touch.  I like the applicator scoopy-thingy.  My first eye cream and probably last.  Please don’t stop making this lol",1.0
"This product is very luxurious with the beautiful packaging to the silky formula of this cream. I wanted to love this so much considering how expensive it is. It is a very nice moisturizer, not saying its not good. However, I have dry skin and it did not work out very well for me. It didn’t give me the hydration I was looking for and I would also get random pimples which led to me to immediately discontinue this product. I recommend you try a sample before buying the whole thing to see how it works for you. I loved the concept of it though, being a water cream and the smell is also very refreshing but for me, it was not worth the price.",0.0
Holy grail moisturizer!! I have tired super expensive creams and this one is the best!! It really does help to plump my smile lines and fill them in. I have about 6 refills in myCart waiting for the sale,1.0
Don’t know if it’s just me but these did not work at all won’t be buying again. A little painful peeling off. A spot treatment serum works 10 times better,0.0
"I received this sunscreen from Influencer and was so excited to try it as I had heard such good things about Shiseido. Ultimately I liked it, but it’s not my absolute favorite sunscreen and I do not reach for it a lot. The product leaves no white residue which is amazing but it is pretty thick and feels heavy on the skin. I didn’t like wearing it under makeup but I think it would be great for a day at the beach where you aren’t wearing anything else on your face.",1.0
"This is a holy grail product at such an affordable price. Great for people with eczema, and keeps your face super hydrated after. It’s a very creamy cleanser and I love that because it really feels like I’m removing all the dirt and oil off my face.",1.0
"I’ve bought close to 15 jars of this moisturizer. I use the aqua for daytime and the Moisturizing Bomb for night time. I’ve bought really expensive moisturizers and affordable ones, this one always wins. I have super dry/dehydrated and sensitive skin and this never fails me.",1.0
I love this. I use it after my makeup and it makes my face glow. I will buy again.,1.0
"This is without a doubt my favorite sunscreen. The texture of it is really nice -- it’s smooth, it absorbs quickly and evenly, and is -- as advertised -- unseen when you put it on. I add it over my moisturizer and my skin feels great. The sunscreen feels weightless, doesn’t leave any oily residue, and doesn’t make me sweat or breakout. The best part is that it’s perfect to wear when running/sweating outside, especially because the scent is very subtle.",1.0
"I got this product to try for free from Influenster. Big fan! I carry this around in my purse and can use it over makeup throughout the day or in an emergency when I happen to end up spending extra time in the sunshine! It goes on easy, soaks in well and doesn’t leave you feel greasy. It smells good and feels good and I’m a big fan of this product. I would absolutely buy it again.",1.0
"My girlfriend gave this to me because she received it in her Ipsy bag. I’ve been using it for the past week. As someone with dry-ish skin, I was really excited to try this out. It made my skin look dewy and beautiful. A little went a long way, too much and you look greasy. However, after the first use I had deep, painful zits on my chin. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and used it for a few more days, but the acne just got worse. And I’m not an acne-prone person.",0.0
"I got a sample of this and wish I could afford to buy a full size. It’s so great! I started using prescription retin-a (Tretenoin) and my skin has been peeling around my acne. This moisturizer manages to feel thick on my hands, but lightweight on my face. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft. I’ve tried many moisturizers since getting on Tret and this has by far been the best.",1.0
"I am late 30’s with skin that has gone from normal, combination to normal, dry, with some sensitivity.  I received this product as a sample - during the middle of July when my skin is not as dry as the winter months - and it seems to work pretty well for this time of year.  It is light weight and feels good during application.  The true test though would be during the winter months here in the Midwest.  One bug con for me is the price.  There are  couple other products that have worked just as well that are literally 60% less in price.",0.0
"I have very dry lips. They often crack and peel in the winter. I started using this and it has completely transformed my lips. After one night, my lips were soft and smooth. It was like a miracle. If you suffer from dry lips and constantly have to use chapstick, do yourself a favor and give this a try. You will not be disappointed.",1.0
"This mask cleared my skin so quickly. I was having a bad day and a few pimples popped off, 15 minutes with this thing on my skin felt so refreshed and the next day almost all the pimples disappeared!!! I love this so much. I received this product as a free sample",1.0

"This is the perfect gel moisturizer ! I love how it makes my skin feel. I’m very picky when it comes to things making my skin feel sticky and this doesn’t! Absorbed well, I also have sensitive skin and it made it nice.  I’m have to also mention the packaging is so pretty just like all of those other products.",1.0
Noticed a difference overnight! I’ve been using for a few weeks now and it gets better and better. Very lightweight but my skin has never felt smoother or more moisturized.  It is a bit pricey but a small pump goes a long way. Love the packaging. Smells refreshing and clean.,1.0

"My boyfriend walked in yesterday and the first thing he said to me was “WOW your skin is glowing!“I received this product for Christmas and have been using it every night as my first step cleanser. After having multiple dermatologists mistake my dehydrated skin as oily skin, and giving me the wrong products to use I now have a lot of blackheads as well as acne scarring and hyperpigmentation. I have been using exfoliating products for the last year in an effort to get rid of my blackheads and clogged pores. After hearing about this enzyme cleansing balm and reading reviews I decided I wanted to try it and add it to my routine.First off I love the fruity refreshing smell. It does dissipate so if you’re concerned about a strong fragrance I wouldn’t let that deter you. It’s a very creamy balm consistency. I haven’t had any issues with it being runny or needing to be mixed like some other reviews have said so maybe that is a storing issue. It spreads on the skin really nicely and does a good job of removing makeup as my step one cleanser. To be fair I do not use foundation and only do eye makeup and lipstick. It rinses off better than other balm cleansers that I have used and leaves my skin really smooth. My skin feels so nice after I almost don’t want to do my step two cleanser.Being as I have only been using it a couple weeks, it’s hard to tell if it’s impacting my blackheads since they are so old and deep. But it is worth noting that the last pore strip I used seemed to pull out a lot more debris from my skin so maybe that is because of this cleanser.It only takes a small amount of product to cleanse my face so this jar is going to last me quite a while.It’s a bit more expensive than the last balm that I used but smells better, works better and takes less product to cleanse so in the long run I think it will actually be cheaper. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a step one cleanser.",1.0
"This product is AMAZING! It is my current go-to nighttime moisture. My skin is congested with large pores and blackheads (I know, the three un-holy trinity when it comes to skin talk). I’ve been using this product for about a month now and I can definitely say that I AM A FAN. My face cleared up within the first week and my large pores are now barely noticeable. My skin has never looked so good! Definitely recommend this product if you suffer from the three un-holy trinity like I do. Not to mention the ingredients are clean and gentle for every day use. Bonus!",1.0
"I do like this cream, it has helped with my under eyes pigmentation. I don’t have wrinkles yes, I am 24 years old, so I couldn’t say it works for wrinkles but I do feel like it gives you a more fresh look.",1.0
I received this for free from Influenster for my honest review. I love the smell and this leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. there are cheaper options that work as good but it’s a pretty good price for a high end brand.,1.0
"I got a jar of this cream free from influenster,really needed it as had dark circles,along with I sleeping for longer than I was and applying this at night I noticed the dark circles improved considerably,it’s not a thin cream but not thick either consistency inbetween doesn’t feel harsh under the eye I like it",1.0
This toner is amazing. It smells awesome and my skin has definitely improved since using it. It has smoothed my skin which was full of acne scars. I had large pores. Notice I’m saying “had”. This product totally delivers.,1.0
A nice product that is easy to use and apply while also leaving my face feeling soft,1.0
This is a wonderful concert. Feels great on the scan I feel like a deep clean and left but there’s no scent. It leaves my skin feeling rushed and ready for additional products or for the day. The only reason why I’m not giving five stars is because I didn’t do a great job removing all of my make up mascara and under eye concealer. I received this free from Influenster campaign. All thoughts and pinions are my own.,1.0
"I didn’t know a water mist could be so life-changing! You get a lot of product for the price too and honestly, I love it more than the elixir. It’s light and feels cooling on the skin. It’s really helped with any redness or blotches on my skin and brightens my overall complexion.",1.0
NEW FAVORITE! I was previously using dermalogica precleanse but i noticed my face very raw and irritated especially bc I have a tendency to oil cleanse for over 10 minutes. However when i switched to this balm i noticed no irritation. It leaves my skin super soft just make sure to use on dry skin and use water to emulsify it before washing it off completely. I also follow up with a gel cleanser but It is not drying or stripping what so ever!,1.0
Absolutely loved this serum. It made my skin feel amazing. The only other serum i’ve tried that seemed to be better than this was the Genifique.,1.0
This is the best face soap I’ve ever used! I love the whole murad line but this one has proven to be my holy grail. It definitely keeps acne at bay!,1.0
I loved that it grabbed all the make up off my face and so gentle on my eyes too.. never irritated the 4 times I used it. Obsessed with this cleanser. Thanks to @influenster I’m hooked!,1.0
"If you don’t like physical exfoliation then consider this option, I do both not on the same day but go back and forth . You will be impress of how much dead skin will roll of your face. Skin care will sink in better .",1.0
Love this mask! Helps so much with texture and pores.,1.0
AMAZING! the best products out there for any skin type. I am obsessed with using this line.,1.0
I used up most of the bottle when I realized it didn’t do anything for me. My skin looks the same and the product has been pilling. But it did work on my brother so I guess it just depends on your skin.,1.0
I absolutely love this cream! It is the only moisturizer that does not irritate my sensitive skin! I have an extra sensitive dry skin during winter... Only product that has saved me is this! I also use the cleanser and love it! The combo has saved me this past couple of months! Love love love!,1.0
"absolutely adore this liquid silk primer from Tatcha!! Ir made my makeup and especially my eye shadow absolutely pop!! My skin feels so smooth, it was lightweight but luxurious at the same time. I only had to use just a little bit and it spread so evenly across my skin! It’s like your own personal filter. Definitely going to be a staple from now on!!!#Tatcha #MyLiquidSilkCanvas",1.0
"I been using the eye cream on my daily bases and it’s been helping me when I need to use my make up, it could feel the difference only using the product a couple of day.It’s super easy to apply and it’s definitely part of my routine now.",1.0
"I received this sample in my Sephora order that was delivered this afternoon. I love that the scrub was strong because I have acne and love to deep clean my pores. It has a gel consistency. This left my face really soft and hydrated. This didn’t completely mattify my face as I like face cleansers to do. Also the fragrance smelled “chemically“ made. It smelled like a sour strawberry and not as sweet as I would like, for example: a Strawberry Starburst. When rinsing off my face, my mouth accidentally opened (oops!) and I got some on my tongue. It does NOT taste like strawberries, btw. Still, I like the fact that it exfoliated my face and made it softer. I recommend this for people with dry skin and not oily skin like mine.",1.0
"Love this face wash!! Leaves skin feeling soft, smells great, nice texture, and they did well with the face wash packaging (compared to the green bottle which sucks) Definitely get this face wash",1.0

"I used to love Bite beauty’s agave lip mask, but after their reformulation it didn’t work for me. So I tried this out and absolutely love it. It’s pleasantly thick and moisturizing and smells wonderful. I’ve tried the original flavor and vanilla. Both are great but I prefer original just a bit more. One little tub lasts me about six months. It’s so worth it!",1.0
I’ve been using this for six months after receiving it as a gift and my skin has literally never been better. It’s definitely the priciest item in my routine but a little goes a long way.,1.0
Feels like air on my skin. Not sticky or slimy. It visibly reduced pores and fine lines in less than 5 minutes. High quality product!,1.0
Been using this eye cream for several weeks and the area underneath and around my eyes have looked noticeably smoother. I’ve also noticed fewer lines and it looks more glowy. I definitely feel instantly refreshed so I have started to wear a during the day as well to give my eyes a boost.,1.0
I started using this toner about three weeks ago and I’ve noticed my skin looks brighter which I’m happy with especially in the winter. I haven’t noticed a diminishing of dark spots yet but I’ll keep trying it and post an update. I personally like the smell of the toner and it doesn’t make my skin dry out. So far I’m happy with it.,1.0
"This essence feels nice on the skin and is applied just like a toner. I take 2-3 shakes to the hand and pat it all over my face and neck. It feels cool, refreshing and my quenched face immediately feels satisfied and supple. This product is definitely more of a splurge but if you’re really into skincare and want a great light bouncy serum, this is the one to get. The packaging is sleek and would look great in your bathroom cabinet or counter. The only downside of this essence is the price but if you’re willing to pay, you’re definitely getting quality product!",1.0
I received it complimentary from Skinfix in exchange of my honest opinion. It is such a amazing moisturizer for your skin. It gives such a nice youthful appearance to your skin. I loved it that it is fragrance free and other chemicals. It’s so light yet moisturizing and hydrating.,1.0
surprisingly fragrant (the smell is amazing) yet very soft and not harsh on the skin. My skin feels amazing in the morning and I’ve stopped suffering dry patches since I’ve been using this. it may not be for everyone but it worked really well for me!,1.0

Great lightweight moisturizer. I use it 2x a day and I see a huge difference in my skin. It’s perfect for those hot days. I pair it with my summer Fridays sunscreen!,1.0
"This is an excellent solution for redness. It goes on smooth and is slightly refreshing. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of introducing my 89 year old grandma to this when I was Christmas-ing with her in TN, and she stole it from me! It does really well on her age spots and the redness she has from melanoma treatments, so I am happy she has it.",1.0
I loveeeee this product. It really does feel cool on your skin and when you rinse it off it leaves your skin feeling firm and clean! It’s also a super fun color! I received this product as complimentary to test it and I would highly recommend it!,1.0

"I love this lip balm! It is super hydrating and the color it leaves on my lip is super natural and brightening. I can wear this lip balm everyday or use it as a step before I apply my lip gloss for more glam/makeup looks. I have a medium skin tone and more pigmented lips, so this lip balm adds a nice touch of color without being too vibrant or a full lipstick look! This lip balm was gifted by Fresh, but I will be making a trip to Sephora to check out additional colors!",1.0
I wear this every morning. It’s  perfect under makeup since it refreshing and light and doesn’t leave your skin feeing heavy or creasy like other moisturatiZers. I love the energizing scent as well. A huge plus: I’ve been using for about a month and it hasn’t broken me out not even once that’s a huge pro in my book. I will continue to use as my daily morning routine. Thank you influenster for sending me this to test out.,1.0
"Normally, my skin is extremely oily and I have the rather large pores that usually go along with it. I’ve been looking for a night cream to add to my routine, and decided to give this a try before I busted out the big bucks for something else. When I started using this product, my skin was pretty blemish free, and each day for about a week I found myself waking up with breakouts. Eventually it subsided, but with this being the only change to my routine, I chalked it up to this. I decided to keep using it, and like I said, it’s subsided, and my skin is back to normal, but I haven’t noticed any real big changes, good or bad. Skin is pretty well just like I’m not using anything at all. I figure it’s better to use this than nothing at all, and it’s worth it for the price. I’m not necessarily sure if I’d “recommend“ it, I’d say give it a try, but try other options, as well, as I’m still looking for a night cream.",1.0

"Big fan of the Caudalie Elixir face mist! I have purchased  over than 5 times of this face mist. I prefer to use it in the morning, the herbal mint smell really help me to freshen up! This one is suitable for oil and combination skin type. Help to control face oil and hydrate the skin in the same time. Easy to use and great smell! Would recommend it to my friends.",1.0
My absolute new favorite toner! I received this complimentary for review from Octoly and I am so happy I did!  Love that Laniege combined a toner and moisturizer together. I’m always in a hurry in the morning so this saves me so much time in my skincare routine! Love the consistency of it as well since it is a milky formula. Also love that it doesn’t burn my skin since there isn’t any alcohol in it. I get nervous using toners since some irritate my skin. But this one left it so cleaned and moisturized! Love the packaging as well! The bottle seems new from other Laniege products which I LOVE it!! Highly recommend this toner! I promise you will love it!,1.0
"Skin felt extremely refreshed and soft. A little goes a long way with the facial cleanser, which is always a plus. I was extremely surprised at how soft my skin was just after applying the facial toner. Gave did feel a little dry after I applied the Pietra essence but nothing too troublesome, my face did soften back up after I applied the milky lotion. I would definitely recommend and buy again.",1.0
Perfect moisturizer! Leaves my skin so soft and hydrated! My skin loves it!,1.0
I mean it’s basic and essential nothing crazy but it’s my staple,1.0
"I tried out this cleanser and was surprised by how much i enjoyed it. Im really not a fan of any physical exfoliators because they are usually to harsh. However, the sugar crystals in this cleanser melt and so the scrubbing isnt very harsh. if you add more water it becomes much more gentle but if you want more of a scrub then you dont need to add much water. this leaves my skin feeling so nice, soft and clean. i only use this once week but you could probably use it 3 times a week if wanted.",1.0
"The formula is nice. It is moisturizing and non greasy. The skin doesn’t feel like its stretching at all when applied. My only concern is when I wake up in the morning, my face looks like I have put in oil! I probably would not pay $50 for this ever.",0.0
"This stuff is strong and effective, it also cleared my acne and acne scars too.",1.0
"I LOVED this product. I really didn’t know what to expect when I first received this product complimentary through Influenster for testing purposes, but I was so surprised by how much I actually liked it. I’m very particular about what I put on my skin, and not all Tatcha products have ingredients I’ll use. This one was safe though! It didn’t irritate my rosacea at all. It is so nice and hydrating. It absorbs right into my skin and makes it look so healthy and plump. I use to have this weird texture in between my brows. I couldn’t get rid of it no matter what products I used or how many times I exfoliated. After the first use of this product I noticed a difference in the texture and now that I’ve used this regularly for about 2 weeks that texture has completely disappeared! I am so amazed by this product!!",1.0
"This has really helped to target my fine lines! I noticed a pretty visible reduction in my fine lines in my forehead after about a week of using this consistently. My skin looks so much healthier too, very bright and dewy (not greasy, just hydrated!) I love that a little goes a long way, making this a product that might seem pricey initially but it’ll last a long time. Highly recommend!",1.0
"I received the Lip Butter Balm in Vanilla complimentary from Summer Fridays for review. First of all, I love the chic and minimalistic packaging of this lip balm. It is transparent so you can wear this anytime. Lip balm is the must product for me year around and I wear it overnight. The texture of Summer Fridays lip butter balm is not too thick and really easy to apply. It works fast on my dry lips and they feel instantly smooth. There is a hint of vanilla scent but it is very subtle. However, moisturizing effect does not last for a long time. Since it’s called lip balm, I expected to be very nourishing but it feels more like a lip gloss.",0.0
"I love this stuff SO much! I just moved from Texas to Colorado. So my skin went from being in a very humid environment to a very dry one. Within a week of being here I noticed my skin becoming very dry. I started using this product at night before bed. Let me tell ya, this stuff worked wonders! Not only is it very hydrating but it has the most beautiful smell that is not too overwhelming!",1.0
"I love how it suds up, it’s the only face cleanser I’ve used that doesn’t leave even the slightest feeling of irritation or tightness. I took for granted that it is possible to have your face clean but not feel even 1% irritated.

Personally test use by myself and family members, Would like to give my zeal and honest opinions of this product, leave my authentic thoughts and feelings about the product we have tried and this is exchange the product. I received it as a gift, complimentary from Sunday Riley. This is one of the most awesome products I have ever had. I have dark spots on my face and this product is lightning them up. I love this product so much. It works great! I can say it is getting rid of my dark spots.  I have found that is making a difference and I’ve tried everything. However, when  I wake up in the morning my skin feels so soft. They really are doing something right! This is a perfect light serum. The best product ever, all the same serum as that first time I had tried it. My skin, after one use overnight, was incredibly different and smoother and softer. My skin really needed this. Also, a little goes a long way. I highly recommend treating yourself to Sunday Riley’s product, it is so amazing. You will get all the benefits of vitamin c but it’s more gentle. I feel it’s definitely worth and I will keep using this. LOVE!",1.0
"After using the essence from amore pacific, I expected this one to have a similar effect. That one makes your skin feel instantly softer while this one truly feels like just plain water on your face.

"I really love this! Gentle, Clean, and works great!",1.0
"is incredible, from the first moment I applied it I felt a sensation of freshness and when I removed it my skin was incredible, I just love it",1.0
"I’ve never had an issue with acne but with all the added stress in my life lately, my face broke out bad on my cheeks and forehead. But all the cleansers I tried just kept drying out my face! This one was gentle and cleansed while hydrating just slightly and helped my acne to disappear quite quickly!",1.0
Super gentle and creamy non drying. Little goes long way it will last you so long. So worth the price.Would recommend for combo skin👍🏻,1.0
Absolutely love this product it works exceptionally well. I sometimes don’t take my mascara off before bed and it’s always a pain the next day but not with this product,1.0
"If you remove makeup with a multiple step routine- this is a must have!!!! For longwearing, full glam, or even a simple makeup look, this is a game changer! The texture is a balm so I was a bit skeptical, but if you follow the instructions and apply the balm ON YOUR FACE WITH MAKEUP before doing anything else to it, this works magic! It melts into your skin while also dissolving and melting the makeup away! I find that it leaves my skin very very soft yet hydrated which is perfect for me. A little goes a long way, so it’s very cost effective in terms of a multi-step makeup removing routine (this balm to melt makeup first + micellar water + 1 cotton pad/wipes) vs using more of a product (ex: more micellar water + 2-3 cotton pads/2-3makeup wipes) to get the same level of “clean“ we all aim for when taking makeup off. Got this as a sample but I will def be buying the full bigger size. I do wish a spatula or something was included or maybe the packaging could’ve been a squeeze tube for hygienic purposes instead of sticking your finger in the jar, but for the quality of the product; it’s easy to overlook that one little thing :)",1.0
"This is the second time I have repurchased this INNISFREE sunscreen and I will be repurchasing in the future. This doesn’t leave a white cast, sting my eyes, and it works well with my sensitive skin. And you can’t beat the price! I only wish there was a larger size for me to purchase!",1.0
"I want to give this a five, the smell was amazing, but I have sensitive skin and it left my face feeling bumpy after one use so I think if you have sensitive skin, try and do a patch test first.",1.0
I LOVE this! Best money I’ve ever spent at Sephora,1.0
I absolutely love this product. I was using a different moisturizer before I got this one I’m my Influenster box and the one I had would leave my face kind of oily. The Korres one does not. It leave my face moisturized but not oily. I’m planning on buying it when my sample runs out.,1.0
this smells sooo good!! It’s like smelling lemon pound cake a bottle. Exfoliates pretty good with small grains that are not too harsh on the skin.,1.0
Love this!! I do wish it was more cost-friendly but works great. Leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing.,1.0
"I received this moisturizer from Influenster and have been using it daily for the past couple weeks. This is a wonderful product! It has a little bit of a watery gel texture and feels very soothing. It smells great too, like roses and citrus. Since I have combination skin, the idea of a matte moisturizer was really intriguing to me. The matte finish it leaves is not TOO matte, more like just not oily, if that makes sense. It isn’t crazy moisturizing, but it also doesn’t leave my skin dry. The only thing I’ve noticed is sometimes it doesn’t play well with my sunscreen, but usually it’s not an issue if I let the moisturizer sink into my skin for a couple minutes first. Overall, I would recommend this to people with combination or oily skin! Just make sure to get a little spoon or something to apply it with if you’re concerned about sanitation.",1.0
"I bought the sample size to try and I really enjoyed using this product! This is the best toner for me so far and my skin feels a difference right after I use my cleanser, very refreshing.",1.0
"I’ve been using Ordinary skincare products for 3 years now, this is by far the best hyaluronic acid for my mature skin, I also use other products from this line and my skin looks hydrated, youthful and it feels wonderful, best purchase ever I am hooked.",1.0
I love this as a morning moisturizer under my makeup! It sets well on my skin and doesn’t make me look greasy the way some other heavy moisturizers do,1.0
I received a sample of this. It is amazing!!! It’s the most effective exfoliater I have used so far. Other products I have used in the past do not deliver like this one does! I mostly have issues with clogged pores and helped after one use. It was not irritating at all and my skin felt so soft afterwards!!! I also had a nice glow! I used this before bed followed by my usual serums and moisturizer and my face was still so soft in the morning. I will definitely be purchasing this!,1.0
"I’ve been using this cream for some time now, and it has kept my skin very soft, hydrated and healthy looking. I started using it during winter because my skin was getting very damaged. Since the container is pretty big, it will probably last for a long time.",1.0
I have VERY dry skin & sensitivity due to mild rosacea & this just does not do enough for me. It does absorb well & didn’t irritate my skin.,0.0
I have super sensitive skin that is starting to turn dry after being combination leaning to oily in my youth. So many products irritated my skin but this is a lifesaver!,1.0
I could see results after just a few days of using this product. I really like the texture and the fragrance as with all Glow Recipe products. I use this serum every night in my skincare routine and I really enjoy it. Complimentary from Glow Recipe.,1.0
I received this product #complementary to review from #Influinster This is a great natural intelligent company. The use of natural ingredients of the highest quality are used. A plus is the site offers free shipping on all orders. #bossbabevoxbox I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1.0
I really loved this serum! I used it at night before going to bed and in the morning my face was all plump and hydrated. I rarely see a notable difference this fast with other products. I would like to try it for a longer time to see the benefit of anti-aging.,1.0
Left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Absorbed fast and had a light scent. I received a sample but would consider purchasing a full size especially during the dry winter months!,1.0
"Nothing wrong with it, but even after continued use, I didn’t notice any difference!",0.0
I use this almost every morning. I just can’t wake up without it under my eyes! So refreshing and cool!!,1.0
I have been using this for years. Love it,1.0
"Used this months ago, and I’m surprised it has such high ratings. I have very dry skin and this did absolutely nothing for me in terms of moisturizing. Also, the texture was awful.",0.0
"I like this little stick. It is very easy to use. I am a little confused by the “swipe, don’t wipe” meaning. At first it is a solid. When applying to your face it is melted into your skin from its warmth. Applies well! No major smells.",1.0
I was lucky enough to review this as a sample. I loved it so much that I went out and bought a large bottle! My fine lines are disappearing and so are my dark circles. Truly a new part of my nightly ritual.,1.0
Not good for full glam eyes. They’re also not exfoliating which is still great for everyday use which I ❤️ LOVE!,1.0
I have not gone a day without this moisturizer in over a year!,1.0
I received this product free to try in a voxbox with Influenster and I am soooo excited! I have been wanting to try some tatcha stuff for EVER and this dewy serum did not disappoint! It smells amazing and has this great texture that is very soft and moisturizing! Been using it in the middle of the day post workout and rinse to give me back a little moisture! Gonna let some of my current skin care products run out and sprinkle in some additional tatcha to replace them!,1.0
"Absolutely love this product, ever since I started using this it had made my skin feel softer after removing my make up. My face feels more clean and it removes ALL my make up.!",1.0
"I’ve been meaning to try this out for awhile now since I read some great reviews on it, but this product isn’t for me. It’s a nice product that absorbed into my skin really quickly, but it wasn’t hydrating enough for my combination skin so I had to go back to my old moisturizer.",0.0
"Since using this product with my spinning brush, the little white heads I had above my nose are gone, and my skin looks so much clearer. I love this product so much. I am going to have a buy a new one just so I can have a back up when the one I have is done.",1.0
This feels thick and greasy. It sits on top of my skin like an orange greasy layer. The green turns a horrible orange shade on me. Settles into lines and is impossible to put make up on top of.,0.0
"Really helps with my smile lines/nasolabial folds, big fan of this",1.0
I really enjoyed this product. The texture is so smooth and it’s not greasy. I use it at nights and I have combo skin so I think it would be good for everyone! I received this for testing purposes!,1.0
"Ma peau était déshydrater, elle chauffait lorsque j’appliquais de la crème. En deux jours le sérum a restauré ma barrière cutané. Meilleur produit que j’ai utilisé.",1.0
This is my favorite moisturizer ever! It’s not enough for the dryer months but it’s so nice in the warmer days. It’s not greasy and it doesn’t break me out as bad as other moisturizers do. I will keep on buying this as my go to moisturizer.,1.0
they where ok but i did not like them as much a i thought i would.,1.0
"Weird texture, slight burn, no noticeable improvement.",0.0
"This is the perfect lightweight moisturizer for me. A little really does go a long way - just a dab will do! This doesn’t leave me feeling greasy or oily, and keeps my skin hydrated all day! I also really appreciate that this does not have a scent - I am sensitive to fragrance in my skincare. This is fantastic for my dry dry skin!",1.0
My pimple came back a day later. I just put another one on but that kinda of defeats the purpose of Peace’n Out your acne with one dot. I’ll keep you posted on the status of this pimple.,1.0
"This is my second tube of that Cleanser , works for my sensitive skin and I love the creamy texture and nice smell .",1.0
If your looking to give your skin a refreshing look this would be it. The product is not bad but I felt all I benefited was a fresh look. No really deep cleaning.,0.0
"This is lightweight on the skin and has the consistency of a thin lotion or sunscreen. It moderately hydrates and absorbs into my skin. It can be used morning and night, and it’s sufficient enough to skip additional products. However, my skin is oily by mid-day, even during the cold, dry winter. So, I prefer using this only in the PM. It’s noticably fragranced, which I’m not a fan of, but the scent does not linger for long. It also doesn’t flare up my reactive, acne-prone skin, which is very important when I’m trying new skincare products. Overall, this is an average product that I think would play nice with different skin types. I don’t love it, but I also don’t dislike it.",0.0
I never thought I would love a sample size so much! It’s so mouisturizing and felt so rich! No stickiness at all and exceded my expectation. Thank you to influenster for sending this out to me and for letting me test it out.,1.0
"love this so much, it just melts into my skin and doesn’t leave anything. i like the smell of it too because it reminds me of summer.  :)",1.0
I loved this serum! The bottle looks so chic. I love the matte finish to bottle. The serum is a bit thin and runny. It has a silky texture while applying it. Once you apply it you can feel your skin fresh. It does leave it a bit tacky but it absorbs rather well. Over the last 2 months I have seen a fairly change on my skin. I feel it a lot more smooth. It has slightly finished the look of some wrinkles and dry skin around my nose. I love the dewy look it leaves. It gas a nice shine to it.,1.0
This is a great serum for dry skin! Very happy with this product.,1.0
Incredible. I have combination skin and it’s been incredibly difficult to find something that doesn’t make my skin too oily or too dry. It clears my skin completely without causing dry spots.,1.0
Hands down my favorite lip product ever. Invest in one of these and you will not be disappointed. I have the Gummy Bear and Apple Lime and both snell amazing.,1.0
"I have tried so many toners from drugstore to high-end ones. My fav from drugstore is Thayers. I have gone through 2 bottles, it still works good for my skin. But since my skin starts breaking out. Thayers seems like doesn’t hydrate my skin enough when I use it along with acne treatment. So, I decided to give this Fresh Rose deep hydration toner a try and I’m glad I did. It is very refreshing, it smells amazing. When I use acne treatment I tend to use less layers of skincare. I only do toner-> acne treatment-> booster. I don’t even use moisturizer and this toner works like   one for my skin. Definitely recommended. But careful, some skin types might be reacted with ROSES!! (I have 1 friend like that)",1.0
Just get it. Seriously incredible. I’m on my 3rd jar. It lasts forever. So silky. Will forever repurchase.,1.0
"Absorbs quickly into my skin, I love the ingredients, it’s easy to use, and it feels amazing on my skin.",1.0
For years I used the Korres Greek Yoghurt cleanser. One day I got introduced to this cleanser and at first I was unsure. It’s a gel formula and I’ve always been weird with using gels on my dry/dehydrated skin. WELL...I am so happy I got this cleanser! I’ve never loved a cleanser like I love this one. It actually balances my skin so I don’t feel dry afterwards but the best part is that my skin is so healthy because of it. I don’t break out like I use to and my skin generally just feels so much better. I’ve been using it for over 2 months and I could not be happier.,1.0
Would not recommend. Made my acne way worse. Didn’t help get rid of dead skin. Not for sensitive skin. Felt sticky.,0.0
"I loved the consistency (it’s light and absorbs quick which I love because essentially, it feels like  nothing is on your skin). I did not notice a difference, the bottle is pretty small and I ran out pretty quick. I heard that The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid is a bit better so I’ll be trying that out soon. Even though I didn’t notice a change in my skin texture, in the long run, it did keep me moisturized because my skin tends to get dry patches but the hyaluronic acid helped against that.",0.0
I love that it’s safe enough to use daily for an exfoliant. It immediately brightens my skin! I like using this after working out and it just gives me the healthy skin I need! Complimentary from Dermalogica.,1.0
"Loooove this lip balm! Super soothing on the lips + a nice pigment to add a little pop of color at the same time! It’s pretty pigmented so I’d just keep that in mind, but otherwise it’s a great on the go lip care! Gifted by fresh",1.0
I could honestly cry right now. I got a sample size of this in my most recent Sephora order. I am so happy with this. I washed my face for the first time tonight and it didn’t end up being red when I was finished. I just thought my skin was always red after cleansing. But it’s not. I just needed to find the best cleanser and this is absolutely amazing. I will use it forever as my morning cleanser. Thank you FAB. I can’t wait to get the rest of your products.,1.0
"Gifted by farmacy beauty. My new favourite night time moisturizer. I lobe how thick it is but melts into the skin making my skin feel and look plump, hydrated. I love the consistency plus the ceramides. I was my face and leave the skin a little damp to take extra advantage of the ceramides in this moisturizer. Love it.",1.0
"I break out easily and hate the smell of sunscreen but understand the importance of wearing it, especially for my face. I’m extremely picky. This sunscreen is seriously the best I’ve ever tried. No scent, no breakouts, awesome summer glow with a slight tint to it, and does not feel super oily like some of the higher SPF sunscreens. Tried a sample and I was hooked. Even better than Neutrogena Dry Touch. For me, it is worth the price to have something I love to wear when I’m outside so much. (I do not leave reviews as often as I should. When I remember to, it means I really, really love the product!)",1.0
"I must say it’s not too often that I run right out and grab a product after using a sample. This is that time! I didn’t get any stinging, but I get professional treatments done. That said, I still noticed a difference.",1.0
"I really liked this oil. It was very hydrating and wasn’t too much for my oily skin. It has a slight scent to it, but didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this if you’re looking for a quality rosehip face oil.",1.0
This product has been amazing at evening out my skin tone. The tingling sensation passed after a couple of days. I think it has helped my makeup come on flawlessly and My skin texture has improved so much. I wear it at night before bed followed by the buffet or Vit C,1.0
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. I tested this product for at least 2 weeks, applying 2-3 drops every day and night. In my personal opinion, I really enjoyed using Guerlain’s Abeille Royal Advanced Youth Watery Oil. The packaging was very appealing, in particular the watery oil with the beads. Very stunning! I liked that 95% of its ingredients are naturally-derived. It has a really nice, water texture and was easy to apply. A little goes a long way, especially when only needing 2-3 drops per application. The little nourishing beads broke down when rubbing the watery oil in my hands prior to application. It absorbed very well into the skin leaving it very nourished, soft and hydrated afterwards. I did notice that it helped heal a couple of trouble skin areas that I had and wondered if this was due to the watery oil containing several types of powerful honey. Prior to using the product, I thought that it would have had a honey-type scent, but instead it does have a strong perfume smell that lasts and becomes a bit awkward when other products also have a scent. I do wish that it smelled a little less and had a more natural scent to fit with its description. Overall, I really did see positive benefits to my skin after using this product!",1.0
I got this as a free sample ans bought the larger size. It’s so light and refreshing with just a slight tingleon my sensitive skin. I feel it does a great jobCleaning and really helps me get that glow. I love it.,1.0
"This product is great! One of my favorite masks at the moment. I really felt like it shrank my pore size. I received this product for free via Influenster, and am so happy I did! Overall I would recommend it to everyone, great product!",1.0
"First of all, I love the minimalist packaging, and second of all, adaptogens. I feel so Gwyneth Paltrow/Amanda Chantal Bacon when I use this?? Everyone must try. Superb. An 11 out of 10. But honestly, it’s made my skin so soft and you can tell a lot of thought went into the ingredients of this cream. I’m planning on trying out more products from the line!",1.0
Best hydrating spray! I don’t use it as a makeup setting spray -- this is my ’go to’ in the afternoon to put some moisture back into my skin.....with or without makeup on. I take this with me whenever I travel. My boyfriend and daughter use it too!,1.0
