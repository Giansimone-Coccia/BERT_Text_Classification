Muy buena crema para los ojos. La he estado usando en diferentes noches y me encanta la sensación se frescura que deja en la parte de las ojeras.,1.0
I haven’t experienced the pilling that other reviewers have noted - this serum goes on super smooth and feels like it sinks in quickly! I love it under makeup and it doesn’t stay sticky. I received this product as a free sample - but I would purchase again. I do wish the bottle was a bit bigger!,1.0
I wanted to love this so bad but it made my chin/jawline get small bumps and break out in a rash and I typically never break out.,0.0
I received the Clinique Wrinkle Correct Seurm sample from #topboxcircle.  This is not like the product your mom use to use back in the day.  I found it left my skin feeling soft and supple.  I personally used this product prior to bed as I already use a day time serum.  But if you are looking to start a skin routine or looking for something else I would highly recommend giving this a try,1.0
I like the Then I Met You Cleansing black WAAAY better. This one didn’t do a great job of breaking down my makeup. It made it harder for it to come off because it would cling to my foundation and create this weird consistency. It’s always not as solid as I expected. It’s very soft and kind of liquidy. Not sure if I got a bad product that was damaged.... I’m sticking my to my other cleansing balm. I highly recommend The Then I Met You Cleansing Balm. It’s a bit more expensive but I’ve been using it for 6 months and it has never failed me.,0.0
I used the essence everyday for a week and really didn’t notice any positive effects. it felt like it was dehydrating my skin and I ended up breaking out a lot.,0.0
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I have to say I enjoy using this product. The scent is nice it’s reminds me of a natural smell. Plus it has like a light weight gel like texture. It absorbs into my skin quickly and I am loving the results !,1.0
Ah-mazing!  Since I started using this product to take my makeup off prior to cleansing it has changed my life!  I don’t feel like I’m scrubbing harshly to get makeup off now and my face thanks me !,1.0
i will constantly repurchase this! my favourite product ever,1.0
"I have sensitive combinations skin so I was a bit wary of trying this product after reading some reviews of skin breakouts. My skin actually did pretty well with the product! A little truly goes a long way and it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling like most serums. I didn’t really notice a huge difference after the first week of using but I did start noticing my make up going on smoother. By the second week, my skin had a blurred effect which is amazing! If you have sensitive skin, I recommend starting with using only once a day and move up to two times a day. My skin was fine without small bumps or pimples popping up.",1.0
"For reference, I am 18 with sensitive, dry/combination, acne-prone skin. Before giving the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream a shot, I had tried so many moisturizers with no luck. Since using this, my skin is now completely clear! I introduced this product to my mom, aged 50, and my 13-year-old sister; now, they are also in love with it! This moisturizer is truly suitable for all skin types and concerns. Thank you for saving my skin, Kiehl’s!",1.0
I feel like I waste product when dispensing the product. I wish it was a pump instead of a spout. I also feel like it takes a lot of product to cover my face. It does smell good and dies make my skin soft. It may even have helped make my scar on my forehead less noticeable.  I wouldn’t buy it again but would accept it as a gift.,0.0
It was alright. It did moisturized my under eye but that’s pretty much it. Plus it’s expensive for the amount it brings.,0.0
"Since I received the free sample with one of purchases I’ve been obsessed with this face cleanser. The little travel size bottle lasted me about 2-3 weeks (and I used it everyday) as you only need a bit for every use. It’s doesn’t foam up but it gets into a creamy texture. As an exfoliant it’s scary because you’re not sure if it will dry out your face or if the traditional little beads in the exfoliant will be too much, but this exfoliant is perfect it only has a few beads and the smell is great, it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry and I can feel how clean it is. I have very large pores around my nose area and within two weeks of using it *gross part is coming* I squeezed around my large pores and a bunch of black heads just started coming out with almost no pressure so I didn’t damage my skin from squeezing and everything still came out. I have continued this process and I can see that some of the pores are now smaller. I bought the large version and refilled my travel size and I don’t think I will stop using it.",1.0
"This product is definitely the best makeup removing balm I’ve tried. It doesn’t leave an oily residue behind and the makeup does “melt“ away, and it smells super good too!",1.0
"I was looking forward to using this product because of all the good things I’d heard about it but it disappointed me. After the first use it left my skin red, flaky and it burned. The redness continued for three days. The mask also broke me out (I’m don’t have acne prone skin) and it’s been 2 months and I’m still trying to get rid of those break out areas. It left my skin very sensitive especially on my cheeks and around my nose. I do not recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin. I only got to use the mask once and it was a big waste of money. The mask wasn’t soothing and it had a strong smell to it as well.",0.0
"I was super excited to try this essence because it is so hyped up, but was honestly disappointed. It had no noticeable effect on my skin. Thin and watery and not as hydrating as I prefer. Not bad by any means but not special. I received this product complimentary of Influenster for reviewing purposes.",0.0
"Kind of scared to use it, I received it in the mail and right away noticed a ton of white fibers/clumps inside, like almost half the bottle looks that way. Not sure if it’s some kind of mold or if it’s nothing but it definitely makes me nervous to put it on my face. It is pretty cold right now where I live so I’m going to let it sit for a while and see if that goes away.",0.0
"Very underwhelmed by this. I expected a lotion or cream, not a saturated fat. I had to use quite a bit just to get my non-waterproof mascara off.  Eventually I got it off, and eyes are soft, but I see this getting used up pretty quickly.",0.0
"I really love this eye moisturizer. I apply it before I go to bed and skin around my eyes is smooth and fresh in the morning. It works well on my ultra dry, aging skin.",1.0
"I love the texture - so creamy. This is a great moisturizer so if dryness is your biggest concern I wouldn’t hesitate to get this. And after a couple of weeks I definitely noticed the darkness under my eyes has gone down and my skin just looks brighter.HOWEVER this did nothing for my fine lines that have recently appeared (I’m in my late twenties). And unless you put on a good primer every time you wear concealer, I don’t reccommend this product for under makeup. Even after a good concealer and setting powder, the cream just settled into my two littles lines.",1.0
"I really wanted to love this product after hearing a few friends rave about it and seeing their very noticeable results. I have combo/oily skin that is somewhat sensitive, and this product really irritated my skin and made me break out. I thought my skin might get used to it but even after diluting it with moisturizer and using it only once a week or once/2 weeks, I still broke out every time.",0.0
"I have been using this product for over a year now, and I love it. It has cleared my complexion up since using it.",1.0
"Clogged my pores, I tried it 2 separate times.",0.0
"This stuff left me amazed! I wear a full face of makeup that never comes off with just one wash and I tried out a small nickel sized amount of product with water and lathered like directed, and it wiped off EVERYTHING! Even my raccoon mascaras leftover was swiped clean! I’m floored and my face felt like a baby butt after. Tried it alongside the peptide cream and I woke up with fresh, even, plump looking skin. I’m buying the full size of both products",1.0
"Not a fan of this. The smell is nice, and the consistency has a nice feeling when applied but it sucks all the moisture out of my skin, after I apply it my skin is so dry that when I make an expression it itches and stings. Not sure if that’s because it’s silicone free or just not moisturizing enough. For the price I have to pass! My search for the holy grail moisturizer continues.",0.0
I received this product complementary for my honest review. I enjoyed the subtle scent of this product. It is a great gentle exfoliator! I feel that is better than the one I am currently using. Therefore I will be purchasing this in the future. Totally recommend!,1.0
"All I can say about this product is WOW. I will start by stating that am blessed with naturally healthy skin, so it’s rare that I see any significant changes when I use a new skincare product. But let me tell you that this product is my new holy grail - not only is it beautifully packaged, but the texture is lovely. Goes on slightly “slick” (not oily or sticky) and my skin absorbs it well. I wake up with the softest, plumpest, most hydrated skin I’ve ever had. Honestly I’ve started calling it my “botox”. A little goes a long way so in my opinion, although the botte is on the small side it’s most definitely worth the price. It has no scent which I appreciate because I feel a lot of skin products either are too overwhelming scented, or they smell like straight up chemicals. Overall I’m in love and can’t wait to buy this again.",1.0
"I have normal skin for the most part (a little dry, some fine lines), but I still try to use ultra gentle cleansers, just to be safe and avoid irritating it. This was definitely gentle on my skin (no redness, stinging, or breakouts, and it was cooling upon application), and my face felt clean after using it. However, a) it is overpriced. There are other gentle cleansers out there that do the exact same thing and feel the same for like a third of this price; and b) it had a slightly strange smell—I think it’s trying to be cucumber, but it smells more like a cucumber that’s starting to rot. I might finish off the sample bottle I got, but would not purchase.",0.0
"I was really excited to try out this moisturizer because of all the good reviews and how much i like the drunk elephant brand. First time using it made my face sting, get all red and irritated, and i did not feel moisturized at all. I have no idea what caused this reaction!",0.0
"unfortunately this product was far too harsh on my extremely dry skin. I started noticing a bit of a rash as well after use, which may be an allergy to be fair (although I’ve never had a reaction to anything like this before). I will say it felt pretty terrible on my skin regardless.  wouldn’t recommend if youre someone with exceptionally dry skin in the winter.",0.0
"This cream is very hydrating and left my skin very soft. I love how it is a gel formula, works perfectly for my combination skin. Smells amazing and doesn’t feel too greasy like some other moisturizers.",1.0
"I expected a night moisturizer to be more.. moisturizing. I also never break out with products and this cream wrecked my face. Not a fan, really wish I didn’t waste the money.",0.0
"My face feels pretty good after using it. But, I don’t like the texture of the product and it doesn’t spread on the face easily. I’m glad I tried it, but I would not buy it (got a trial size).",0.0
"I recieved this as a sample in the “fantasic four set“ and this is a HOAX. It isn’t your skin that is rolling off, it’s the product clumping because of the friction from rubbing it on you face. I know this because put a pea-sized drop of the product on my countertop and used gloves to rub it on the counter top. It clumped the same way it did on my skin. I wouldn’t waste my money on this SCAM. Please test it for yourself ladies.",0.0
"It’s a great product, I only chose to give it three stars because I don’t agree people with oily skin should use this. Personally I try everything to get rid of the oily-look, only to layer this on as my last step and just. . . Look oily.",0.0
Broke me out so much . I used chemical exfoliants bc they work best for me . But this wrecks my skin every time i use it . I have a break out for 3 days . Not a fan,0.0
My skin feels so hydrated! I have been using this for a week straight. I mix this with my DE vitamin c serum and my skin loves it! It absorbs really quickly. I also love the packaging.,1.0
"Okay. So, I was super skeptical about this stuff. I used to work for Sephora and all my pals that still work for corporate and the stores were raving about this product when it first launched. It took me a while to finally suck it up and try it, and I’m sooooo glad I did. The first time I used it and applied my serum and moisturizer over the top my skin legit felt like a porcelain doll. SOOOOO SMOOTH! I get all the hype now! I’m totally obsessed! Oh and a little goes a long way! Most definitely worth every penny!",1.0
Im african american and i have some undereye darkness and this did absolutely nothing and not moisturizing for my eyes either,0.0
Love love love. I repurchase this every time I run out. Sad they no longer have the 8 oz version which lasted me almost 6 months. My favorite part about this wash is that my skin literally squeaks after I use it-- a feeling I have not gotten with any other face wash and that I am now addicted to.,1.0
"I got the mini size of this as a free sample with my points and I was super excited that someone as broke as me was allowed to touch a Tatcha product. However, that is where my excitement ended. What is with the intense amount of fragrance in here, folks? The first time I used this, I could smell it on my skin for like 2 hours, and I am not a person at all sensitive to smell. It’s a nice smell, I guess, but I really try to stay away fro fragrance and it’s weird to me that this particular product would go so hard with their stank, since it is a “clean“ product and a leave-on cream. Fragrance of all kinds is bad for your skin, even if you don’t notice it now!!! It does a nice job of hydrating the skin, I will say/. Buuuuuut...so do a lot of other products that cost a lot less than this. I will finish my tiny lil cute tub of this (very precious packaging on the mini size) but would absolutely never dream of buy the VERY EXPENSIVE full size version.",0.0
I got this product about 6 months ago and when i first used it I felt the tingle that other reviewers were talking about and it freaked me out because to me it  felt more like burning. I immediately washed it off. I decided after all this time to give it another chance and I don’t know what happened this time that was different from my first initial use but this time it worked great. The tingling sensation was minimal and lasted for a few seconds and it is sticky to the touch but i didn’t feel it while laying down on my pillow. I woke up this morning and my skin looks like i went and gotten a facial. I don’t know what’s going to happen with further use but I’m excited already.,1.0
"Product arrived a dark greenish grey instead of the blue as shown in pictures. Had a strong smell of alcohol and was sort of sour and minty, with a layer of spotted fluid on top and along the sides. Was supremely disappointed, didn’t even bother using it as it was obviously off. Seems like this has happened to a few people over the years and might have something to do with how quickly this formula goes bad.",0.0
"This is so moisturizing! i also have the lip sleeping mask, but this is better for during the day. The applicator makes it so you can easily control how much comes out of the tube. it’s not meant to be super pigmented, which I like because I can wear it all the time that way. I have incredibly dry lips, and this has helped so much.",1.0
The fact that this has such rave reviews is quite puzzling. It literally feels like I splashed water on my face. Nothing more.  Disappointing.,0.0
after blending and blending and blending still left green gray residue? product ended up balling up and messing up my makeup completely 0/5 stars if it was an option,0.0
This product is nice as it’s not to great and doesn’t get all over your sheets. The only downside is that it feels like any other chap steak and ends up drying out by the time I’m awake. I also wish this was in a stick form as you have to rub your finger in the product a few times due to the more solid consistency. I received this item from influencer,1.0
"It did a pretty good job removing my sunscreen and waterproof mascara. I recommend putting it on a dry face, instead of damp like the bottle says. It doesn’t melt super well and sometimes it feels like there’s film on your face.",0.0
I was super excited to try this as I love other Milk Makeup products but this broke me out! I was pretty disappointed to say the least.,0.0
This is the best exfoliator I’ve ever used.  Wish it was sold in larger quantities.,1.0
"Sticky, smells bad. Very very thick. Not what I was expecting at all. Do not purchase if you are looking for a water gel consistency of any kind. This is more of a silicon primer than a moisturizer.",0.0
Alright this is literally my first review. I bought this in 2018 and I really loved it. It was one of my favorite back then and  I became a huge fan of KORRES. I bought it again and I’m pretty sure that they changed the formula because the new generation is the worst. It dries out my eye area skin and it is peeling now. However my forehead and nose are so oily and I feel like I can never truly get this oil screen off my face. The worst experience ever. Never got so disappointed by a skincare product before.,0.0
I received mine from Influenster for an honest review. The consistency is on the thicker side which I like and it doesn’t do a bad job of moisturizing at all. I like the ingredients in it and it helped plump my skin! Great product.,1.0
This product was gifted by Fresh.  This serum has a light weight texture and has been a good addition to my skincare routine. I’m liking how it makes my skin feel thus far. It’s very hydrating and soaks into my skin well.,1.0
"i got this as a sample and i noticed no real difference it just made my face soft. that was it, smells bad too. not for me.",0.0
This product left my face feeling clean and not sticky at all! I loved the products consistency and texture! Definitely recommend!,1.0
"amazing!Love at 1st use..I decided to tryout this brand because I read very good reviews about it and now I totally agree that this product is a miracle, it’s easy to apply.. and rise off; immediately you’ll feel smoother & bringer skin :)",1.0
the size is good the price is good too...if i could rank out this product from five star which 5 is the best and 1 is the least thing...i would defiantly rank it ZERO... by give it a (-1) for the smell its the most bad smell i have ever smaled before ...and cleaning ways giving it almost (1) ... that’s make it out a Zero ... i dont know how i spent a 9.99$ on it i know its a not very much to be mad about ... i literally wouldn’t repurchase it again...   i really hate to say that about any thing but i have a very very very bad experience using it ... am sorry...,0.0
"I love that this product is green, smells good and gel textured. I am so sad this product didn’t work for me. I wanted it to work so bad! Even though this product is marketed for combination / oily skin, it caused my skin to be even more oily. The product wasn’t hydrating enough for me.",0.0
"Wow!  This product delivers.  I’ve had for about a month and I’ve used 5 times, for 10 minutes each time.  My dark spots and old acne scars have dramatically faded.  I am extremely pale and my acne spots were all dark red.  They have gotten smaller as they faded, and I think using this product a few more times and the spots will be gone.  I am thrilled!  I’ve used so many products that have done nothing, and I’m sold on this product (and the price). I will continue using this when my acne flares up.",1.0
"I’ve been using this product for the past 2 weeks sadly I have not seen any significant difference in my skin, however, is it super refreshing and I can see how it absorbs quickly. There is no fragrance which it’s nice. There’s still a little bit left on the container so I will continue to use it until it’s gone. This is a high priced item so I won’t be buying it since it didn’t work for me.",0.0
"This product is extremely light. Unfortunately, it did not hydrate my skin. My skin is dry, but not extremely dry. With this product, I felt like I was putting a very thin layer of lotion, which does not do the trick at all. I like that it’s a clean product, but it fell short of expectations.",0.0
"I didnt like the smell, bit pricey for what it does.",0.0
"Well I noticed I used a lot of product with only one use. Whether using a cotton ball, my fingers, or a cotton round, This product comes out a lot so I didn’t like that at all. While it does feel cool and refreshing on the face I didn’t notice any spectacular long lasting results with this. I received this product free in exchange for my honest review.",0.0
"This has a pleasant, non overpowering scent. I thought it applied evenly and smoothly.  I worried about it making my skin break out but it didn’t! It is a great moisturizer and makes my skin feel smooth.",1.0
"I can’t comment on the effectiveness of this serum because I decided to stop using it after 3 days. Every time i would apply it and follow up with my rose oil, the product would start to pill and give my skin the worst feeling. Overall i did not like which is upsetting because i had high hopes for this product.",0.0
"This is the key to glass skin. Its light, not scented, and I wake up with my skin feeling so hydrated and refreshed. Amazing for people with acne prone skin, better than tatcha in my opinion.",1.0
"It’s a fancy gloss, that’s it. Overhyped and overpriced. Also , Sephora is a terrible place to buy any type of k-beauty because the price is so inflated. When I sleep with this lip mask on it actually makes my dry lips worse and I wake up with cracks. Prefer my bite beauty agave!!!!",0.0
I have tried the mint and lemon so far! Love them both! Mint one was probably better in my mind because of the cooling sensation. If you don’t like that feeling just try a different scent.,1.0
It’s OK it does the job I probably would not recommend or re-purchase,0.0
"I absolutely LOVE the ’Camo Drops’ from this same line, so I decided to try this product to get the added benefit of an SPF. However, I highly prefer and recommend the Camo Drops over this. This product is much harder to spread around the face and absorb into the skin, and the shade of beige it turns into is too dark for my fair skin tone. It also leaves a “film“ on my face - like a cream foundation would. If you have redness in your complexion, I suggest using the Camo Drops.",0.0
This is a great thin eye cream! I have deep creases on my lower lids and concealers sit in them poorly. This helps a lot with making my concealer not sit deeply in them!I did use it with my bite beauty foundation (which is my fave) and it sat poorly on top of the eye cream but it’s the only one I’ve had issues with in the years I’ve been using this cream,1.0
"This is a decent sunscreen but it just didn’t work well for my skin. I have acne prone, combination skin type and this sunscreen felt very heavy and greasy on my skin. It also has a strange texture once its spread on skin, kind of velvety feeling- almost like a primer. I like that this didn’t leave my face with a white cast, but it started to clog my pores. This maybe better suited for dry or very dry skin types that are not acne prone. Also make sure to shake the bottle before using or else the sunscreen is going to come out as pure oil as this product separates easily.",0.0
"I’ve been looking for an oil cleanser that would not aggravate my sensitive skin, acne, and eczema. Found it in this Tatcha product. I double cleanse after using it. It’s a keeper.",1.0
"I used it a few times and didn’t really see any difference. Nothing that would make me want to buy the product as I was gifted a sample size. Smells good and feels good, but I feel like there are better brightening serums.",0.0
"I really wanted these strips to be amazing! I have pretty bad sebum buildup and was hoping that these would help clear those out. I left one on my nose and one on my chin overnight, but when I removed them, nothing happened. I haven’t used them since just because it seems like a waste!",0.0
I’m generally a big fan of Caudalie but this was a miss for me. It worked but I had better results (fading my post acne spots) with Glossier’s super glow for a third of the price.,0.0
smells good and is an okay lip balm (not super moisturizing) but the packaging is absolutely horrible. i can’t even use the product anymore because the tin will not open. i have had multiple people try and open it and it won’t budge,0.0
"I have very dry skin, even in the summer. I have been using this for more than a month now so I think it’s been long enough to give it a fair review. I’m not exaggerating that this has somewhat softened my cheek scarring from acne. It has made my occasional acne flair up diminish quickly and without smoothly. It leaves my face feeling so hydrating but not oily. I have been using this  everyday for a month and have barely noticed from how much is left in the bottle. TOTALLY WORTH IT!",1.0
i have combination skin that’s sensitive and this moisturizer is awesome not oily and absorbs right away!!!!!,1.0
"Feels really good and hydrating , smells really nice too ! Not like an overpowering rose scent either. I got this toner just because I’m doing the tarte night toner and sometimes I wake up feeling a little dry , so to balance out my skin I tried this one out and it will be my go to anytime I get dry .",1.0
"It’s just ok. It’s gritty, medium sized granules, but not enough granules to my liking. The smells is really nice. Someone else wrote that it doesn’t dissolve fast and I agree, so good for in-shower use. A bit hard to rinse off and leaves a bit of a sticky residue. I appreciated getting the sample (the tiny 7ml size with a promo code), but would not buy.",0.0
"I’ve been using this cream for the past 2 months. I noticed a change around the 3 week mark. It has improved the look and texture of my skin overall. I was not impressed by the price, but a little goes a long way. I will be buying this night cream again.",1.0
"my skin is extremely oily. this moisturizer didn’t help. i did like how light it felt on my skin and how it absorbed quickly, but my skin still became oily after. returned the container.",0.0
"didn’t do anything, wasn’t even hydrating. I think it actually irritated my under eyes a little bit. You only use a little product so I guess it will last a long time? only positive I can think of.",0.0
Leaves my face sticky for well over an hour. Can’t apply any product on top of it without it creating a mess.,0.0
I received this product for free through Influenster for review. This is my first ever time trying a cleansing balm and I totally see the hype! It removed my makeup so quickly and made my skin feel so soft and didn’t leave any residue. I will continue to enjoy this product!,1.0
So happy that I got a free sample to try this.  Totally worth purchasing,1.0

"my nightly face wash! i used to use the la roche posay salicylic acid cleanser, but i found this one to be more effective for my skin. it does not contain menthol which can be an irritating ingredient. the price tag for this cleanser is something that stood out. imo, the inkey list is one of my favorite and most effective brand at an amazing price. def love this for acne prone skin ;)",1.0
"I received this as a sample, and disliked almost everything about it. It’s very thin, making it hard to apply without dripping, and the blue color caused some stains. After applying, it just sits on my skin and never absorbs, even overnight. After using it for a week, the only visible difference was my oily hair and pillowcase. And to top it off, it has a very unpleasant smell.",0.0
it works pretty well... but the tube has like hardly any product in it :(( i bought this less than 3 months ago and im already running out,0.0
Oh my gosh this stuff is great! It’s thick and creamy with bits of physical exfoliants that are not harsh at all. I was surprised this worked so well it left my face feeling soft and moisturized. Would highly recommend for those who are interested in a physical and chemical exfoliant. As it works great and is not harsh on the skin.,1.0
I was excited to try this. unfortunately it was underwhelming. the cleaner goes has a nice texture but my skin didn’t feel clean after. not a deep cleanse for me,0.0
"LOVE the feel of this serum, but given the sample size it’s hard to see any results.",1.0
"I originally received this in a sephora play box, and it’s been life changing. I’ve always had acne since I was young, starting around 12/13, some of it cystic. I’m now in my mid 30s and still get it, though not as bad. Since I started using this 2-3 times a week, it’s been life changing. I feel so much more confident in my skin, and while I do still have some acne, the ones I do get are much smaller, less painful and go away much faster without scarring. I couldn’t do without this product!",1.0
This made me breakout. It may be my skin or the AHA’s but I cant say I loved it. I did receive this product complimentary product to review.,0.0
Great product and was very effective and noticed good results after a few days of use.,1.0
"For reference I have combination skin. With the right products, I don’t have any oils break through by the end of a full day of makeup but if i also do enjoy a more natural look where my natural oils can come through. However when I applied a tiny bit of this face base prior to applying makeup my face got oily very quickly. It feels super nice and moisturizing but I would rather use it as a nighttime moisturizer or a base for no makeup makeup days! Under my usual products it is just too intense for my skin type. Overall would recommend for people with normal to dry skin, not combo oily skin.",0.0
I received these complimentary from Peace out skincare to try. These acne patches are game changers! I literally had some hormonal breakouts in the chin area. I applied a patch at night and when I woke up the next day the pimple was literally barely visible anymore and the patch drew everything completely out. It was honestly like magic.,1.0
This didn’t irritate my skin. Pairs great with the glycolic night serum. Not super heavy & very moisturizing- overall can’t complain,1.0
"I love origins’ products... and i was REALLY excited to use this, thankfully I bought the mini sizes, it really did nothing for my face.. just made it greasy, sticky. I used it for over week and a half, I tried to give it a chance but there are far more better moisturizers than this. Also, I have combo skin.",0.0
"I got this to try it out and if I’m being honest, I don’t think it does anything but it does feel nice going on the skin. It has a very nice consistency",0.0
"I liked it, but doesn’t seem worth the hefty price tag. Feels like overpriced Nivea almost. The peppermint oil did slightly irritate my skin. I think there are better hydrating leave-on masks out there!",0.0
"I love how well it blends into my natural skin color and hides the redness. When I’m running late, I’ll use this all over my face and neck. It works great as a sheer cover-up, hiding redness, and it has spf 35. My skin is super sensitive from burns that are still healing; and I can use this daily without irritating my skin. There are a few nitpicky things that could be better. The thing that bothers me the most is the smell. The scent is very wood and herbal forward. Also, the formulation of the product tends to separate. Sometimes it’s more watery in the center of the container and more clay like around the rim of the jar. And the product will stain white or lighter color fabrics, leaving behind a flesh tone color. For example, on hot days, I’ll dab the sweat off my face with a towel. And since my towels are white, I can see the product on the towel. But, it usually comes off in the laundry without any problems.",1.0
"It really makes your face soft, it adds like a nice filter to it. I would definitely get it again down the line",1.0
"I bought this to use as an overnight mask but it always leaves my face feeling super tight and dry in the morning. I then started using it as a wash off mask and the results are not as hydrating as I would have expected from the price. However, I’ve been applying it on my under eye area and it has visibly improved the appearance. In my personal opinion, I do not recommend this product and will not be purchasing it again.",0.0
"It’s a good product and does what it claims. It does keep my face hydrated but I find that I need to apply quite a bit of the product. Considering the price, I am not sure if it is worth for me. I find there are other similar products at a much cheaper price.",0.0
"I’ve used Good Genes for over a year and have repurchased it three times. It is worth every penny to me as my skin is sensitive and have never had an issue with this product. In addition, I’ve used it with Luna oil and Tidal cream. They blend well together and do not cause any reactions. Good Genes has a pleasant light lemon/lemongrass smell and is very light in texture. It has made my skin so plump and soft. It has eliminated dryness and accompanying flakiness. I even use it on my hands during winter when the humidity is super low and my hand stopped cracking.",1.0
"Received #freeproduct in exchange for honest review. This serum is so light weight and easily absorbed that it doesn’t feel like I applied anything. It is not tacky/ oily/ dry after application which I love. It smells like a combination  of grass, ginger, and cleaning products but doesn’t bother me. I notice this serum helps at controlling my oils during the day. It has helped with making pores appear smaller, too. I do not notice any increase or decrease in active breakouts with this product ( I struggle with hormonal acne during that time of month), but it does help with calming the spots I do get. Recommend this serum for those that have acne prone oily skin if you want to splurge and treat yourself to a lovely formulated serum.",1.0
"I think this product is ok, It makes your lips look nice and glossy, makes them hydrated, and has almost no smell/is light. I would not purchase it though as there are cheaper options on the market that work just as well/better.",0.0
"I’m so conflicted. I read all the reviews and really want this to work but it hasn’t yet. Previously, was using a 20% Glycolic Peel once a week and switching off of different masks, peels, and retinols. I always finished with Fresh Age Delay Overnight Mask & Eye Concentrate.. my skin was amazing. I was hoping this Sunday Riley would take it to the next level! Unfortunately, it hasn’t. If anything I feel like my skin has become worse. It’s dull, dry, I’ve broken out, and I’m starting to see lines on my forehead that my old regimen would never allow! I’m giving this two stars because I want it to work so badly. I put all my hope into this product the last few months but will definitely start to incorporate previous regimen products. Hopefully I can find a way to maximum benefits and make these work for me!",0.0
Love the Berry Lip Glow Balm. Glides on easily and feels so good!,1.0
I LOVE this product. It’s very concentrated- a little bit goes a long way. It’s super hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy.,1.0
Does anybody else have a problem with the bottle? I ordered this in the summer but never used it because I realized it said it is not good for sun exposure so when I decided to use it in October the bottle was not functioning properly and they sent me an replacement order but the 2nd bottle also is not functioning.,0.0
LOVE THIS STUFF!! I used to have pretty active acne and acne scarring. I’ve heard so many amazing things about this stuff that I figured I would try it myself. This is the best my face has looked in YEARS!! I will never purchase another face wash again unless it is this stuff!!!!!!!,1.0
I adored the first bottle of this I bought last year and I’m not sure if I got a bad bottle or the formula changed but this pills up everything I use underneath :/ used to be 5/5 but I can’t say that anymore. I’m using the same products I used with the first bottle so I’m not sure what happened.,0.0
"Very hydrating and illuminating moisturizer. Does not make my skin more oily, instead it gives me a glow. I love to use it before going to the gym as a light moisturizer.",1.0
"After using this, my skin felt cleaner and smoother and it drew out the bad stuff from my blemishes, making it easier for my other nightly skincare products to diminish them come morning! The wrinkles and dark spots It smells great, too! My only problems is that I don’t think the packaging stated how much product to apply onto your face, so I ended up putting on too much because a little goes a long way with this product! I would have liked it to have stated something like “1 or 2 pumps.” When I was at the rubbing stage, it still stood pink rather than white because I put so much on. But I will remember this the next time I use it! I was sent this product free to try out.",1.0
Literally the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I have extremely dry skin too. I never leave reviews but I have to with this.,1.0
"This is a sunscreen that you ‘want’ to use. Typically I dread applying sunscreen because of all the effort it takes to blend into my skin. This one is effortless, lightweight and the best part is NO WHITE CAST. Highly recommend giving this a try!",1.0
"I got this as part of the Drunk Elephant The Littles kit. It’s a great cleanser that does what it’s supposed to do, but, for someone that doesn’t wear makeup or have oily skin to begin with, it’s simply not worth the price tag for me.",0.0
LOVEEE this lotion! Feels so luxurious and leaves my face feeling so hydrated even the next morning. It absorbs super quickly into the skin and feels light weight but is so hydrating. Would definitely buy again!,1.0
"When I got this as a sample, I really didn’t quite grasp the idea of a LIP mask, yet alone for nighttime.  I was pleasantly surprised!  My lips in the morning STILL have the product on them and my lips have never been this smooth and soft.  Yes I do a lip scrub, and this goes on right after.  My lipstick has been staying on longer and it may be all in my head, but my lips look a tad fuller.  If you are unsure, just ask for a sample!  It smells good too!  It also comes in vanilla as well!",1.0
"I have extremely dry skin so I thought this would be perfect for me. I used only at night time and it would sit on top of my skin and never sank into my skin even after a couple hours. My husband even asked me why my face looked so greasy and I’ve never had a moisturizer make me greasy being I have dry skin. I need a moisturizer that will sink into my skin and give me hydrating benefits but this just didn’t do it for me. The packaging is adorable and the smell was nice, I wish it worked for me.",0.0
"I have combo skin and find this works well overnight to leave my skin feeling plump and moisturized in the morning. I have not used it as a day cream. While I wouldn’t say this does anything amazing, I do love it.",1.0
"I was really hoping I wouldn’t like this product as much but omg, its amazing. Although its a wash off kind of product, it really leaves my skin feeling amazing and helps it keep acne free. I am definitely going to be repurchasing. It works wonders for my skin type.",1.0
"I have always struggled with chapped lips, until I discovered this holy grail of lip masks! I put it on every night before bed and my lips NEVER peel anymore. I’ve never been so impressed with a product before. If I forget to put it on one night, I can tell my lips are a lot dryer the next day. I’ll never go to bed again without this stuff!",1.0
Love this! Not oily. Light and fast absorbing but super hydrating. Smells good going on but doesn’t leave a scent.  This winter weather isn’t shown in my skin thanks to this wonderful cream.,1.0
"They don’t remove eye makeup that well, and they don’t feel as moist as they should. I had to push hard into my skin for it to really work. Got the sample size though, so I won’t be buying again. I normally use a micellar water so maybe that’s why I don’t like these as much.",0.0
After this I wake up with such moisturizes skin! It feels so smooth during application and absorbs in in just 10 minutes. It has helped reduce the redness induced by dry skin!,1.0
"I wanted to love this, but when they say it turns beige, it really does go that dark. It left a line that looked like a bad makeup line around my whole jaw line. The texture feels like I have a sticky, cheap makeup on my face. It looks like you are wearing makeup as well, it gives your skin that sort of thick texture. As for redness, it did the opposite and made my face go slightly orange as well as darken my skin tone unnaturally. So didn’t work, zero stars and made me skin look worse, another zero stars. I’ve used a lot of skin products over the last 20 years and only several I have hated, this is one of them! Made my skin feel like I hadn’t washed it. Returning!",0.0
"I have oily, acne prone skin however this moisturizer left my skin feeling undernourished and tight.",0.0
This has not helped me with reducing melasma/hyperpigmentation at all which is the main reason I bought it. It does do a decent job of making my skin feel soft afterwards. The pump broke after 2 uses so I’ve been digging product out with a little stick since then. I won’t repurchase.,0.0
I’ve noticed a huge change in my skin it’s so much smoother and my acne scars have died down so much they are almost gone. I will continue to buy this product.,1.0
"I have the worst chapped lips, and always have. They would bleed because they were so chapped. This thing is AMAZING. I’ve used it only 2 nights so far, but my lips are barely chapped now. I can’t wait to see what it does for me after a week of use. Well worth every penny!",1.0
"I was so excited to get this product. I started using it as recommended, every other night at first, then switching to every night. While some have claimed that this helped there acne, it only made mine much worse. I know it was this product, as it is the only part of my routine that I had changed. I returned this to Sephora for a refund, and my acne cleared back up. Disappointing that this didn’t work on my skin type, which is hormonal acne around my jaw area. The packaging is great and it smells wonderful though, which is why I give it two stars.",0.0

"I have the original berry (which I would give 5/5), but recently bought the gummy bear one and I feel the formula is different. I don’t get the same amount of moisture that I did my berry mask. It is still nice, but not outstanding. Not sure if that’s just me- I still like it, but it doesn’t seem to be as stellar as I was expecting. Like others have said, the smell is more an artificial grape scent. It doesn’t last long but it may bother some.",0.0
"I have been using this mask for years! I love the smell, the texture with the rose petals in it and how easy it is to use. This mask makes my skin so soft and I feel it instantly brightens my skin. I love using this before a night out, as it really makes my skin glow.",1.0
"I use this every morning and evening. I have oily to combination skin and it never leaves my face feeling dry or greasy, just perfectly in-between. It has a gel consistency. There’s no exfoliation with this cleanser, so I do a separate exfoliating treatment about twice per week, but I love that this is so gentle yet good enough to remove my makeup. It even removes my eye makeup, but never irritates my eyes. Highly recommend!",1.0
I received a sample as part of a birthday gift. The initial texture feels lovely but once I’ve applied it I found it to be very greasy and thick. Also quite fragrant. I would not consider this moisturizer for oily or combination skin.,0.0
Combination to oily girl here. I found this moisturizer too thick and oily to be used in the morning. HOWEVER I’m using it as a night moisturizer and I’m using Skinfix’s hydrating serum as a morning moisturizer. This moisturizer is great! I saw a difference in my skin immediately and I’ll definitely repurchase. One star off because I would love to see a less thick/oily option from Skinfix for oily girls.,1.0

But no more...After just seven days of using Estée Lauder’s A New Beginning, Even without a vacation, my skin feels like I’ve just had one. Now when I look in the mirror, I see a new me. Younger, glowing, refreshed. Thank you for a new beginning. I will definitely recommend this product to others so that they can have the experience of using this wonderful product.",1.0
"Ok so, I’ve never used a scrub like this because I’ve used more chemical scrubs instead. But trust me, this WORKS. I’ve only been using it for like two weeks and I can already see the acne that I’ve had for years finally disappear. Definitely going to purchase the bigger bottle when I finish mines.",1.0
"I’ve been using this for 2 days, and I’m impressed. It hasn’t done anything miraculous to my crow’s feet yet, but my eyes look so bright and awake! It’s a perceptible improvement. Also, I haven’t experienced irritation, and I used it two days in a row.",1.0
"I have dry/oily skin and this did nothing for me. I really wanted to like this product but even after layering this moisturizer, my face felt extremely dry. I understand that it’s supposed to be matte but my face just feels dry.",0.0
"This is good- but it’s not $58 good. It’s a solid daytime moisturizer sure, but it’s not 10/10. My only complaint is that there is something in this that irritates my eyes- normally products with fragrance give me rhinitis and itchy red eyes. Theres not really too much of a smell and there’s not a fragrant competent that I can see in the ingredients, but there’s something in this that’s slightly irritating. That being said I’m way more sensitive to that than most so for the majority there shouldn’t be a problem. Since I get similar effects with cheaper moisturizers and this gives me slight allergies it’s just not a must for me. I turn to many other moisturizers before this one.",0.0
"I received a sample of this in my Play! box and ended up really liking it and buying the full size.  It brightens, smells good, and leaves my skin feeling fresh.",1.0
"This is good stuff - better than I had expected it to be. The jar comes with its own like silicone spoon that I wipe off after dipping out a little and applying on my lips and around my mouth. The spoon even has its own little case to keep it clean. The cream is really more ointment consistency, but it isn’t greasy. A little goes a very long way - this jar will last forever! It has minimal smell, EXTREMELY moisturizing and clings to your lips as opposed to your pillowcase, as by morning virtually all of the cream has absorbed into your skin. All in all great stuff - lips feel super moisturized in the morning!",1.0
"I use this once a week on my night off from retinol. The texture and smell are very pleasant, and this hasn’t made me break out. But I don’t feel that it has improved my skin more than the less expensive salicylic acid treatments I’ve tried. For this reason I unfortunately don’t think it’s worth the splurge.",0.0
Love this! It did not strip my skin at all as it did for some others.,1.0
Absolutely awful. Tested it on my hand (thankfully) and left a huge orange stain. The directions say to mix 1-12 drops with moisturizer. I only used ONE!,0.0
"I purchased these two days ago because I had a somewhat blind pimple. I put a patch on overnight, and it was dried up in the morning! Which makes it easier and less painful for healing time. Definitely recommend picking up a pack of these. 20 should last a long time for those with occasional breakouts, so they’re great to have in the bathroom vanity whenever a breakout occurs!",1.0
"I was really excited to try this product, especially with the praise surrounding similar items (Good Genes, etc.) Howrver, this serum was just not for me. I don’t have particularly sensitive skin, but after just a few uses of this product, my skin broke out. I thought that I may just be going through a skin “purge” but the breakouts only got worse with time, and I found myself with pimples / blemishes in spots that I normally do not have issues with! Altogether, the packaging was cute and the idea of the product was great, but it just didn’t work for me!Note: received this product complimentary via Influenster, but all opinions are my own!",0.0
"This moisturizer is one of my all time favorites. It’s rich and moisturizing, perfect for keeping the skin hydrated but also works well at repairing my skin when I’ve used too many actives or the weather is just making it feel dry. It is what I am reaching for day and night during this colder weather. It also doesn’t have much of a scent, which I prefer as I don’t have to worry about fragrance irritation. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate or make me breakout. A staple for my routine! This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty.",1.0
I received Peace Out Pore Treatment Strips for free by PINCHme. These were super awesome! I love that I can put it on at night and wake up in the morning and they are still on my face! They actually do what they promise. You can actually SEE the dirt and oil pulled out of my face. My pores are microscopic! My face is smooth and no oil to be found! I LOVE THESE STRIPS! Thank you Peace Out!,1.0
"I don’t really understand what there is to like about this product...I do use this as a first cleanse, so the tremendously greasy residue wouldn’t bother me if it did actually remove all my makeup. But it just doesn’t do the job. I’m always left with mascara residue after I use this. Don’t even think of relying on this for waterproof mascara. I also think the packaging is just a poor choice for this consistency. In theory, I love the idea of a flip-top tube for cleansing balm. But this formula is so thick it is more impractical than helpful. I honestly don’t have anything good to say. I’ve really been wanting to find an affordable cleansing balm, but after much trial and (mostly) error, I will be returning to Farmacy’s Green Clean. 10 dollars is not really a steal if you can’t use the product for its designed purpose.",0.0
"I don’t often write reviews because I’m not usually very passionate about the products I use, but this product has worked wonders on my skin. I had a sample that I’ve been using only a little of because it is so amazing but I finally splurged and purchased the biggest size! This will smooth the skin on your face, and it did not irritate my skin at all, personally. (I have sensitive skin.) I also used this product on dry spots near my elbow that have been a problem, etc. and in minutes it made my skin super soft! (no, not all the stuff that comes off of your skin is dry skin, but in problem areas you will see a lot come off which is satisfying!) Try the product!",1.0
"*I received this product complimentary for review purposes.* I’ve been using this eye cream for over 4 weeks, day and night, and have not noticed any improvement with dark circles or fine lines. There was maybe a little brightening of the area. Included is a before and after image, although the lighting isn’t good in the before picture. The texture is silky and unique to any other eye cream I have tried. It does need some time to sink in before makeup application, but I did not experience any reaction or sensitivity. I wish it worked!",0.0
"Daily Microfoliant comolimentary sample by Dermalogica is one of a kind! It is a powder that when mixed with water, becomes foam. My skin feels like a gentle exfoliation. It is very clarifying and brightening. It also makes my skin soft and smooth. It gives my skin a light glow.",1.0
"This product broke me out and I don’t have break out prone skin. It smells so nice and was pricey so I soldiered through and just used less, eventually just mixing a small amount in with my moisturizer. I used for a month or so, it truthfully did nothing but irritate my skin.",0.0

"I must admit..I did not want to like it. I have a brick wall in my head about goop. Luckily, I received this as a free item via influenster. Turns out...I was wrong. I love it. The formula is probably the lightest, fluffiest exfoliation ever. It exfoliates and does not feel harsh at all. Sadly for my wallet, I’ll buy it.",1.0
"My skin has been oily for my entire life. It’s almost as if it got even oilier s as I got older! Because of this it’s extremely hard to find a night cream that doesn’t end a total mess in the morning. Enter Tatcha Water Cream.

It’s worth the price, and a little goes a long way.",1.0
"The first one I purchased is very bright yellow, like orange color. The second one I purchased is light yellow. Something is wrong with one of the two. The store customer service and the product manufacturer said it is normal to have different color. I ask the manufacturer to make such statement on their website, but was declined. If what they said is true, why they are not willing to clarify for the confusing customer by simply make the statement.",0.0
This is a great facial cream product from Drunk Elephant. I liked the  Lala Retro whipped moisturizer with ceramides especially because it has the ceramides. I’m not sure if the container is the best because it might be hard to get all of the cream out but the cream itself feels nice.,1.0
"Unfortunately the bottle is very poorly designed - the actual pump on the main bottle did not pump, and when I attempted to open the cap, more than half of the product popped out, so very little product remains.

"When I first started using these cotton pads, I didn’t get the hype. When I ran out and tried going back to using regular cotton balls, though, I immediately understood why people are so loyal to this product. Perhaps what I appreciate the most is the square shape and how easy it makes applying toners and essences. This shape comes especially handy if you use them to remove nail polish, as I sometimes do. It’s SO much easier to clear your nails with these cotton pads than it is with cotton balls. I only wish that these weren’t so harmful for the environment.",1.0

"I love the watermelon scent. Feels lightweight. After applying, it feels sticky until skin absorbs it. I love it because it’s oil free, although, I still get oily in my t zone. I bought the sample size to test it on my acne prone skin. I think it helped my skin calmed down a little bit. Packaging is gorgeous.",1.0
"Compared to tatcha’s silk and indigo creams, this product is so thin. I didn’t find it to be adequately hydrating. If you are looking for truly luxurious moisture, reach for their silk cream. That is probably one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever used.",0.0
"A fantastic option for those looking for a no fuss hydrating mositurizer. I like to use serums as my source of active ingredients and use a moisturizer as more of a seal of hydration. The texture is light weight, great if you have combo/oily skin, but still manages to pack a punch in the hydration department. It soaks into the skin relatively quickly and I haven’t had any issues with makeup application after using this moisturizer.",1.0

"DE is supposed to be amazing for your skin, but unfortunately this product didn’t do anything good for me at all. I am oily and acne-prone, and felt like using this nightly - which it says you can do - did awful things to my texture and pores. Instead of making them better, it made them more noticeable, and it took ages after I stopped using the product for things to go back to normal. I also didn’t notice that it did anything at all for my acne. And it’s so very pricey. I plan on finishing up my bottle on my chest and neck during the night, and then will never repurchase it again.",0.0
Fantastic day time moisturizer. Manages to make my skin feel quenched while also being pretty light in texture.,1.0

The texture is soft and smooth and feels so good on my skin. Cleanses without stripping, I never get that tight feeling. I’ve also used it as a mask when my skin is feeling irritated and I love how soothing it is. I am on my second tube and have a backup ready to go. This is a staple in my skincare routine!",1.0

I am new to Belif as a brand and recently purchased a set that included the Moisturizing Eye Bomb. I’ve been using this eye cream two times a day for a while now and I agree that it is quite moisturizing but I have not experienced any reduction in fine lines or puffiness or the darkness I sometimes get when I haven’t had enough sleep. I wouldn’t purchase this product on its own as I believe I can get the same moisturizing properties from a regular moisturizer. When I buy an eye cream I need it to do more than just moisturize. Three stars for the moisturizing effect and for not pilling under or over other products and makeup.,0.0
"I was sent a small sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream from Topbox in exchange for my honest opinion. This product has CL1870 Peptide Complex, Hyaluronic Acid and Soybean Seed Extract and is supposed to reduce wrinkles. The results shown were all self reported and were after a month of using. I can only speak about a few days of use as that’s all the sample gave. I did find this smoothing and hydrating when used on top of ther Serum from the same line. it absorbed quickly and wasn’t greasy. If you do see visibly reduced wrinkles then I think this would be a great cream to use.",1.0
There isn’t enough in the sample for me to form an opinion and I won’t be spending $90 to finalize an opinion. My skin looks hydrated and it’s a thick gel texture. The only drawback is it’s pretty strong cologne scent. I try to use unscented products on my sensitive skin.,0.0
"This is a great lightweight exfoliator. I have dry/sensitive skin and most exfoliators leave my skin pretty red, but this one is very gentle and still works great!

Overall, this is a great product if you’re looking for glowing radiant skin!",1.0

"I’ll get right to the point... I saw no improvement in my skin when adding the Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Miri-Recovery Complex to my night time skin routine. That being said, things I did appreciate about the product include: it is not perfumed and has no strong odors, it feels nice on the skin, and it doesn’t get sticky or tacky feeling. Adding the product into my routine didn’t cause any breakouts or irritations. It just was. I would recommend if you’re interested in trying but would try without high expectations.",0.0
"I really like this oil. I have dry/combo skin and I use this on the days that I don’t use my retinol, it feels so luxurious on my skin and has a really pleasant light scent. I also like to use it with my Dr. Jart CiCipair moisturizer to sort of thin it out. I will say it takes awhile to absorb into the skin completely. About an hour. For the first hour you’ll look super oily but just give it awhile and it will completely soak into your skin. My only complaints: 1. The price, absolutely not worth $72 lol. It’s a great oil don’t get me wrong but that’s so expensive. You can get a travel size on their website + a deluxe sample for $30. 2. Vitamin C shouldn’t be in see through bottles. It causes it to become unstable. The dark green bottle is better but not 100%. So opt for the darker bottle even though it’s not as aesthetically pleasing. In general, I like this oil! I just bought the .5 ounce from their website. The sample I received lasted me more than two weeks and it was even smaller than that. You only need 2 drops.",1.0
"I have dry skin and am constantly needing chapstick all the time so I was really excited about this, hoping it would help my lips stay soft and reduce the need for chapstick. Nope.

"I have typically dry skin and before purchasing this Clinique moisturizer used the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream. Great product by the way, definitely recommend the Ultra Repair Cream over this to those with dry skin! Unfortunately, I thought this moisturizer would be better than the Ultra Repair Cream, but I was wrong. The moment I put it on my face for the first time, I hated it and immediately washed it off. It had a very off-putting smell that I see no one else talk about? It also made my face crazy greasy. I just wouldn’t recommend this product. If you are having issues with dry skin though, you should definitely look into the FAB Ultra Repair Cream!",0.0
it has the most amazing orange scent and soaks into the skin so well ... hydrates perfectly but still lightweight ... i will be rebuying this again and again,1.0
This is like rubbing a Bath and Body Works candle on your lips. It’s is waxy and lacks hydration. Super disappointed as I expected so much more from the brand.,0.0
My absolutely must have always !!,1.0
"I received this eye cream as a free sample. This gel eye cream is really thick and takes a while to sink into my skin. It’s quite tacky while it seeps in but once it does it has a silky feel after. It did help with some of my dark circles, especially after a few late nights but it didn’t completely make them disappear.",1.0
I like that this exfoliator is both a physical and chemical exfoliator. My skin was going through some breakouts and I believe this helped clear it up because of the Glycolic Acid. I use it by rubbing it on my skin and letting it sit for 3 minutes then I wash it off. During those 3 minutes I feel some tingling but nothing too excessive. My face always feels so smooth after using this. I use this 1-2 times a week.,1.0
Hydrate bien mais rien de spécial. Je n’ai pas aimé le contenant.,0.0
"This did NOTHING for my skin. Infact, it made my skin soo dry that I had patches of skin coming off all over my face AND my lips. Although, I always made aure to wear it under a moisturizer. Would have returned it but couldn’t be bothered because it was so cheap. It went to the garbage.",0.0
Did not cleanse well. Definitely not for combination/ oily skin types,0.0
"I didn’t like the how this product felt on my skin after applying it - it felt like it didn’t fully absorb and therefore I felt like I had some sort of residue left on my skin. Even when used underneath a moisturizer, I still felt that same residue feeling after the moisturizer absorbed into the skin.  It did do a good job of moisturizing though. I felt like my skin did not get dry even when used alone.",0.0
My skin has never felt SO clean!! <3I love this exfoliator product because it’s so gentle I can use it every day. I feel like using just a regular cleanser never removes all of my makeup/debris of the day and adding this to my routine has made my skin brighter and smoother. Plus I also find it fun to mix the powder and make a paste; it’s different from other products I’ve used before.,1.0
I really wanted to be able to use this but i can’t get over the smell and it gives my skin a blue tint. I read all the great reviews and purchase. I want this to work but can’t even cover up the smell with a facial mist.,0.0
"The bottle I have received is very tiny but is available to purchase, it would be a good size to buy to try out the product. The larger size is $72, which seems very expensive for a night serum, so it must be very good! At least we will find out if it is worth the price or not!  I used this before bed, applying to my freshly washed face, before applying moisturizer. It did make my face a little oily and greasy but nothing too uncomfortable that I couldn’t fall asleep and I did not have issues with my hair sticking to my face either. I did however find myself very disappointed by this serum. I tested this product out a lot longer than I usually do before writing before because I was waiting to see results, any results. The ONLY results I can give you is that it did give me little whiteheads and thats it. I did not see any changes with my skin, no glowing, no changes in texture or lines by eyes. The way I see it is this serum is a waste of money to anyone who purchases it. I honestly feel bad giving this product such a bad review when it was sent to me for free to test but I have to give my honest opinions and those are it! I’m sorry, but I do not recommend this product at all.",0.0
"These healing dots are worth adding to your skincare routine. I use these only when I feel a pimple coming on or have one. It helps so I won’t pick at the problem areas (which can cause discoloration and scars). For myself, I find putting the patch on at night and sleeping with it is the best option. It will remove any gunk and oil. Worth a try!",1.0
"I received a deluxe sample of this free from Influenster and Clarins for my honest review. The oil wasn’t too heavy and was easily packaged in single use packets which was great so I wouldn’t use too much. Oil wasn’t too heavy and didn’t cause break outs on my sensitive acne prone over 40 skin. I don’t have noticeable lines and wrinkles yet but I did see an improvement on dullness and clarity of my skin after the seven day use. After my experience with this Clarins product, I’m really excited to give more of their products a chance.",1.0
"Great sunscreen! I have oily skin and live in a dry desert climate. I never found a hybrid moisturizer/sunscreen that I like so I’d use both before makeup application. This products replaces both! It works well under makeup and doesn’t leave a white cast. It gives my skin a lit-from-within glow. It feels super light and gives me the perfect amount of moisture. Not sure if it will be enough in the winter months, but now that’s it’s getting warmer it’s perfect. I haven’t experienced any of the pilling the other reviews mentioned, it may be due to my naturally oily skin.",1.0
"I LOVE THIS EYE CREAM. This is perfect for day and night! I love the thick consistency and how you don’t need to apply a lot. Because it is so thick, I take a small amount on my fingers and warm the product up first then apply lightly under my eye and along my orbital bone with my ring finger. I have extremely sensitive and dry undereyes and this product works so well for me!",1.0
I love this cream! I always have problems with moisturizers or anything cream wise on my face drying me out or leaving me irritated but this is amazing. It fills in my fine lines and it keeps my skin from getting flaky like it always does.,1.0
"I wanted to love this SO badly I read all the reviews and couldn’t wait to try it but it did nothing to my lips!! I kept reading how it smells amazing and mine didn’t smell like anything ?! I’m not sure if I got a bad one but I’m very disappointed :( I feel like I wasted my money because my $2 chapstick did more than this, if I did get a bad one then I hope if you buy this that you get a good one!",0.0
My lips are always dry and chapped no matter what chapstick or balm I use. I’ve been using this for a little over 2 weeks now and my lips feel and look amazing! I honestly cant believe how much better they are. The only complaint I have is that I wish it came in different scents. I will definitely repurchase (if I ever run out that is!),1.0
extremely too harsh on my skin. This isn’t a skin product for people with sensitive skin or rosacea.,0.0
"I was so excited about this cleanser but it completely broke me out! My skin is normally pretty clear, and it had never reacted to a product like this in the past. Honestly, the worst my skin has been in a while.",0.0
"Good everyday cleanser. Gentle and cleans well, smell isn’t bad.",1.0
"So far I’m enjoying this product! I have dry/combo skin and I got this product as a sample. I enjoy using this product as a moisturizer, rather than a primer.  For me, I don’t find this “primes“ the skin enough because I prefer a primer that has a sticky texture so my foundation can stick to it. This product absorbs really well; and the scent is amazing! It isn’t over powering at all. I’m glad I got this as a sample and I WILL be buying this in its full size! Overall, its an approval for me!",1.0
"Love this cleanser, leaves my skin really soft and clean. Whenever my face gets “angry“ I use this and it instantly gets better. It works great for calming my skin, will definitely repurchase.",1.0
"It does make my skin a little more radiance, a little more even, and it feels hydrated, but there’s a lot of problems to this for me:- It’s pricey- It smells really bad, kind of metal/chemical smell. My husband complains about it every night.- Not sure if it’s because of my oily skin, but it peels my skin off like a peeling mask a lot of time when I try to apply it. And it’s not because I don’t exfoliate regularly, I exfoliate 3-5 times a week.After a full bottle of trying to make it works, I still cannot understand the hype behind this product.",0.0
Horrible product and horrible brand. I never see or feel any results. This particular serum made me break out. I do not have sensitive skin.,0.0
This does not make your face feel greasy and it absorbs quickly.,1.0
"This serum is pretty basic for the price. I have only had it for a couple weeks, so I can’t tell yet if the redness relief claim is working for me or not. My skin doesn’t get inflamed from this serum but I can’t say it tones down any redness either. It hydrates my skin a little and feels nice but there are so many serums that are the same or better, it’s just nothing extraordinary in my opinion. Smells like watered down cucumber melon scent, which I’m also not a huge fan of. Will finish the bottle but can’t see myself repurchasing.",0.0
It’s moisturizing and definitely helps for a smooth makeup base. It’s a bit pricey so I’m thankful I received it for review. It’s worth it if you have the money to get it. It makes your makeup look good and helps with the appearance of your skin,1.0
This is a mess and my skin care regiment. It helps keep my skin clear and glowing. So I use this at night after cleansing my face. I would recommend starting off by using this product every 3 days and building up to every night if needed. This gives you a baby chemical Exfoliation. I feel like it helps me with fine lines and acne. I am in my mid 30’s and do believe this is helping me keep this fine lines at bay. I love it and the price is “ chefs kiss” also cruelty free beauty is the best kind of beauty.,1.0
"I’ve used self tanner for many years and this is the worst one i have ever tried!!!! the color for the dark drops was so insanely orange and patchy, and impossible to get off. would never recommend to anyone. 2 stars because the smell was actually not bad like other tanners!",0.0
"I am amazed at how much this has made my foundations go on smoother.  I’ve suffered from dry skin for a long time and was always told to exfoliate, but have been doing so with chemicals.  After another bad patch of trying to find foundations that would work with my skin, I decided to try a daily exfoliator- something I could use in the morning, instead of at night- and found this.  I’ve been using it for 5 days now and they have been the best 5 make up days of my life!! This along with the First Aid coconut primer have literally changed my “make-up“ life.  And I love make-up.  This will become a daily product for me forever.",1.0
"I’ve reordered this cleanser a couple of times now. It’s a good staple to have for sure. My skin isn’t completely clear, but it’s good for the most part. Don’t need much product to get a good lather, pump has never broken on me, and my skin feels fresh afterwards. Will continue to use.",1.0
"love its exactly like the lip mask, but in a tube. super convenient for day use. it’s not as messy",1.0
The best hydrate mask i ever use! My skin is super hydrated and glowing.,1.0
"Such a gorgeous face wash! I’ve recently got into incorporating more strawberry products in my skincare routine because they’re a wonderful ingredient for adding brightness and glow. This face wash is absolutely gorgeous, easy to use and leaves my skin feeling soft and radiant after use. Highly recommend. I received this product as a complimentary gift for review.",1.0
This is the perfect exfoliant for my skin. I’ve used it every other day for a week now and it has made a drastic difference in the appearance of my skin. Typically I break out profusely at the end of the month and my skin has remained flawless looking. I’m actually very impressed. Leaves me skin feeling very clean without over stripping and just super soft. It definitely helps with acne and blemishes too. I love it.,1.0
I thought the scent was too strong but otherwise really enjoy this serum. This was my first Tatcha product (full disclaimer: received this as a gift in exchange for an honest review) and I look forward to trying more Tatcha products in the future :),1.0
Didn’t love this. It didn’t feel luxurious and was more like a drug store cream,0.0
I like how it makes my skin feel but it’s not as good as the farmacy as far as totally getting my mascara and eyeliner off,0.0
"I use this about 3 times a week at night, and it never fails to impress. My skin always feels smooth and looks clear when i wake up. I have very sensitive skin, and it does tingle when i apply, but i don’t break out. Highly recommend to integrate in your nightly routine.",1.0
This stuff smells exactly like Banana Split Dippin’ Dots. And I love it.,1.0
"Works wonders for me. I had many blackheads around my nose and forehead area before I started using this mask. I already recommended this to few of my girl friends and they love it too. It does its job well, however, give it two or three applications until you can see results.",1.0
"There is NOTHING luxurious about this cleansing balm as its described. The texture is absolutely awful, the packaging is useless considering how thick the “balm“ is. I could possibly get past all of that if it actually cleansed and removed makeup well, but it doesn’t.",0.0
"Got this product in my FabFitFun box and I was quite excited because I had just run out of my holy grail Drunk Elephant Baby Facial. With the different price points I was hyped to try this one out. After about a half a bottle of usage, I will say I’ll keep splurging for Drunk Elephant. The thickness and smell of the mask is something I can’t get over and it just isn’t as strong as the Baby Facial. I didn’t notice much of a different in my skin as far as texture, plumpness or glow and I can’t stand the tacky/sticking feeling after washing the mask off. This product would be good for those trying to ease themselves into this kind of mask, but it just didn’t hold a candle to the Drunk Elephant Baby Facial.",0.0
"This sunscreen made me break out extremely bad, once I stopped using it my skin recovered, it was a huge disappointment.",0.0
Fantastic. My favorite moisturizer for the last few months. I have combo skin and so hard to find a good one. It’s so brightening too. Staple in my cabinet.,1.0
"I received this for free in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using this one my face, even though there’s no indication that it’s meant for the face. It’s been gentle on my face and doesn’t clog my pores. I like that it’s not greasy and has a high spf. I don’t like that when I add more layers it starts to peel off of my skin, and is no longer effective. I should be able to add more layers as needed. I personally would not purchase this in the future.",0.0
I love these! They smell wonderful and do great at removing excess eye makeup.,1.0
"It doesn’t do too well against waterproof formulas and it leaves a film of some sort on the skin, which doesn’t feel clean at all. I’ve used plenty of balms and oil cleansers that leave my skin clean yet protected and plump, but this isn’t one of them. After about a month of using this, it began to smell off and I saw dark spots (mold possibly?) on the cleanser. I promptly tossed it, and I hadn’t used half the package yet. I was pretty disappointed.",0.0
This serum gave me my first ever chemical burn after only 3 mins of wearing it. My skip was all red and hot to touch for quite a while after that. I do not have a sensitive skin though and I’m surprised that this product is marketed as leave-in serum. It should say to leave it on your skin for 10 mins at most. I received it as a free sample with the rest of my order so at least I didn’t have to spend money on it. I would definitely recommend doing a patch test before applying it on your face. Really bad experience,0.0
Not sure how but I have tried this for 2 days/nights in a row and it makes my skin look even more dry? I typically use drunk elephant moisturizer in the purple or teal container so I will be returning this and going back to that,0.0
"This product was gifted by GoopBeauty in exchange for my honest review. I have used the GOOPGLOW Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliator several times. First a little goes a long way. The smell is very organic and does not have a strong smell. I like to use the product while I am in the shower and find that it leaves my skin feeling very soft. I did notice that if I do not apply a moisturizer after showering that my skin is a little dry.  I have not noticed any drastic result, but enjoy using the product and will continue to be a Goop user.",1.0
"Yikes, this did not work very well for me! I followed the directions and tested the product on my inner elbow first to make sure my skin wouldn’t react. All was well, so I proceeded to use the product on my face, neck, and chest area, as recommended in the instructions. The next morning I awoke to fine my face feeling quite smooth and was pleased...until I looked in the mirror and found bright red splotches all over my chest area! They didn’t hurt or itch, but they did linger the entire day. Maybe test the product elsewhere before using so you don’t have the same issue as me!",0.0
I picked this up on a whim and now I can’t imagine my life without it! I put the mask on almost every night and my lips are fuller and softer than ever before. They also stay soft/hydrated throughout the day more easily. I am in LOVE with this product and will probably be buying a bunch as gifts for my girl friends for the holidays!,1.0
"Love the Inkey List, but this is just not good. So oily and greasy, feels odd and grimy on the skin, it leaks out of the cap and gets everywhere, and I just cannot stand to use it! :( I would pass on this.",0.0
"The product balls up and collects in your creases throughout the day. Not good to wear under makeup. And if you touch your eye area at all during the day, it gets all crumbly and rubs off. Just doesn’t seem to absorb into the skin – it just sits on top of it. This is not a good product.",0.0
"I absolutely loved this daily microfoliant exfoliator.  That being said, I will definitely be purchasing it again.  I had never been able to find an exfoliator that I had actually liked and which I had found worked without tearing up my skin.  After using this product, I will not be using a different one.",1.0
"I love the SK-II sheet mask, so I thought this would be great too, but I’m really sad to say that it wasn’t and I feel like it’s mostly just hype. I used it for about a month before giving up on it. It soaked right into my skin, but I didn’t see or feel any changes. This is way too expensive for it not to produce any results.",0.0
I don’t understand why this stuff is so sought after/high selling honestly. It’s just full of fillers and sticky. It’s fine if all you want is your lips to look good but the actual results are fleeting. I want a moisturizer that feels smooth to run my lips together and this is not it. Smells good though.,0.0
It is so good for deep cleaning and makes your face look so fresh afterwards.,1.0
My mom and I have both been using this moisturizer it is a new favorite for both of us. It is so hydrating and smell is amazing and not overpowering. The texture is also light but exactly what my dry skin needs. This is a great for anyone in their 20s looking to start using anti aging products but is also loved by my mom who is in in her 50sGifted by Fresh,1.0
This product seemed to be just like any face wash. Not anything extraordinary about this product,0.0
"Honestly I’m not sure what the hype is about this lip balm. It smells great and is affordable, but as soon as you apply this to your lips, it glides off. It doesn’t “stick“ at all. I personally prefer the Fresh Sugar Watermelon Hydrating Lip Balm - and it’s also a clean product!",0.0
"I wished this would have helped my spots and blemishes, but frankly, the only thing the peel did was irritate my skin, and I don’t usually have sensitive skin. I’ve used AHA’s in the past, but those products did not irritate my skin the way this peel did. I tried the peel a few times but never saw any results. For me, this was a dud. Very sad.",0.0
"Wasn’t my favorite product. Not bad and would use it again when needed but I never felt like it got all my makeup off. It also took awhile to feel like my face was clean and it left residue. Mascara was also a struggle, I would wake up and still have some flecks left.",0.0
It felt like it just sat on top of my skin. I have dry skin so I like when I can really feel moisturizers working and this one just didn’t do that. It made my face feel very stiff and It didn’t absorb. It didn’t really solve any skin concerns of mine however my face was smooth on the surface after use. For me it’s not worth it for the price point.,0.0
I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster and Estee Lauder. I have very dry skin and found this to be moisturize but very greasy on my skin. It product itself  was nice and is very smooth on the skin. The packaging was fine and I liked that a little goes along way. I didn’t see any change in my fine lines or any texture changes on my face either.,0.0
I have been using this product for a little over a month now and haven’t seen a difference. Really upset cause i’ve seen a lot of other people have a major difference so it may just not work well for me. I am going to give it another couple weeks since “purging” can last anywhere from 4-6 weeks but it hasn’t made a difference in my acne scars at all.,0.0
I guess I’m one of the unlucky few that did not have success with this product. I am 30 years old with hormonal adult acne. This product made me break out even more. I didn’t notice any glowing skin or any improvement at all actually. Much too expensive for zero results.,0.0
Not crazy about this because I don’t feel like it does anything? Its also really strong smelling and leaves green pigment on me. I have to rub a lot to get it to blend in. Not my favorite,0.0
"This product is not worth it even at the low price. The product does not get absorbed into the skin, it just sits on top of the face as an extra layer and ends up flaking and peeling off once dry. Inconvenient and a waste of money. I did not see any difference in my skin after several uses",0.0
"I decided to invest in a good makeup remover and saw some good reviews! I have sensitive/acne prone skin and man, this stung my face SO badly.

I threw the remainder out immediately.Also I will note: Looks and feels EXACTLY like coconut oil.I look forward to these hype things but this- no way, just a money grab for those who actually bought this.Tip: Coconut oil is much cheaper, you can use it for 100 things AND it is beneficial for your skin!Don’t waste your money...",0.0
Was a bit disappointed with cleanser. YYTP has such amazing moisturizers and masks that I guess I expected their cleanser to be of the same caliber but this didn’t quite cut it for me. It is expensive for what it is and actually can be quite drying. Was just meh. Not worth the money.,0.0

"I know some of y’all Tatcha lovers are going to hate me.. but this product is seriously overhyped and underperforming. If the tatcha name wasn’t on it, you’d think this was Neutrogena gel moisturizer. Not that there’s anything wrong with Neutrogena, but why pay 3x as much for the same result. And I’m not even sure why they have pore-minimizing in the name as it literally didn’t do anything to my pores at all lol. Time for a new formula.",0.0
I love this product! It’s great on sensitive and dry skin. I have rosacea and this does not cause any flare ups for me. I love the light texture it has.,1.0

My fourth purchase! its that good! i love the way it slowly melts the makeup off. It softens the skin and its less harsh then the majority of makeup cleansers. its totally worth it!,1.0

"Sadly I’ve returned this item after one use, here are why:smell rancid, doesn’t remove eyeliner and waterproof mascara well, if you live in cold climate you have to have strength as Dwayne Johnson to be able to use this thing.My house heater’s setting at 22C (or 72F) and it’s almost impossible to squeeze it out from the tube (the balm is almost at solidify state.)

"I have really dry skin in the winter and I use this as part of my night routine. I wake up with hydrated and refreshed skin.

Broke me out like crazy! I’ve used it for a week and it broke me out. Let my skin “reset” to make sure it was the sunscreen. Wore it again for a week and it broke me out again.

Not sure if it help s with anti-ageing. One would need to use it over a long period of time. But overall it’s a great product. I received this product complimentary.",1.0

I have tried a lot of different cleansers - some of them pretty expensive ones like tatcha. I love this cleanser because it is so gentle and gets the cleansing job done without ruining barrier. Word of warning - I have found a pump of this product is way too much for me and enough to be drying. A half pump is plenty to get the job done.,1.0

I really wanted to love this but have not noticed a difference. My face feels drier and patchy since using this which is very strange for my skin. I do love the glowy look it gives when you put it on but it never absorbs into your skin. I will unfortunately be returning.,0.0
I received this sunscreen in my influenster voxbox. I love this sunscreen. I like that it is gentle enough to be used on face and body. I wish I had this sunscreen in the summer when there is more beach time. This sunscreen feels really light but also kept my skin moisturised. I have dry sensitive skin and I hate oily sunscreens. I like that is it waterproof which is perfect for swimming and on the beach.,1.0
"I used a sample of this three nights ago, about an hour post application my skin felt sunburned. It was a bit tight, but soft and moisturized...lying on a pillow was uncomfortable. The next morning my regular cleanser and moisturizer tingled uncomfortably. It abated, and I thought “at least I didn’t break out!“, I spoke too soon. Now I’ve got several new spots. Threw away my sample, it’s not for me.",0.0
"I absolutely love this cleanser, it is a gem of a find for sensitive skin. I have been using it for a few years now and I can’t get enough of it. It leaves my face feeling perfectly cleansed without the tight dry feeling after.",1.0
"I bought this one in the summer time , my face breaking out so bad . I stop using it , I will give another try for winter .",0.0
"It smells horrible and doesn’t work on eye make up, the only thing that comes off are my lashes. I’ve used other balms from other brands with no problem and honestly I prefer to pay those extra bucks to ensure the product works. Giving it two stars because it is cheap, and maybe people with very dry skin would benefit from this in a double cleanse routine. But for me, it’s a no.",0.0
"Love this!!! My lips were cracked, flaking, bleeding and basically a desert. I felt like I had a scab for a pair of lips because of all the matte lipsticks I wore. But this completely restored my lips. Within the span of a week they were completely back to normal. I only wish the packaging was more sanitary. Preferably a squeeze tube. But this is my third time buying and I can’t imagine getting anything else for my lips.",1.0
"Smelled great, but did nothing for my skin. Felt like it did not moisturizer my skin. If your skin is drier I would say to stay away from this product.",0.0
I don’t think this serum did much to my face. I have tested it every day for four months now and I don’t see a change. Which sucks because I paid 90 dollars for this.,0.0
"I received this product for free for testing purposes but my opinions are 10000% my own. First, the packaging is beautiful. I love the simple aesthetic of these products. It looks perfect on any shelf. Secondly, who can resist the smell of Tatcha’s products?! LOVEEE IT. And thirdly, my skin is dry year round. It is hard for me to find a face wash that doesn’t make my skin feel like it’s going to rip apart before I can get moisturizer on. It doesn’t feel like it strips my skin at all. I have noticed how bright my face is after using it. It’s a new staple in my routine.",1.0
This product was amazing. I have used it for the last 7 days and have noticed a complete difference in the appearance of my skin. The redness has gone down and the texture is much smoother!,1.0
"Where can I begin? This serum is amazing. Amazing on the skin, amazing fragrance, keeps my super dry skin moisturized and dewy without any greasiness left after. I have super dry skin and it gets even worse in the winter with some dry patches that can be exposed by my foundation but since trying this out it has helped dramatically. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry skin. I apply it before make up and after cleansing.",1.0
I received a complimentary 7 day sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. I liked how hydrating the serum was but I couldn’t handle the scent! It smelled old and wasn’t pleasant. I don’t feel like it’s worth this price! My skin was a little smoother but nothing crazy.,0.0
"My mom has rosacea and I even got her on this stuff. I’ve been using it for over a year...and as someone that grew up using the Lancome, Chanels, Armani, and Laura Merciers of the world (tinted moisturizer and foundation) this is absolutely my simple go to face “cover-up“ for everyday. It looks so natural and lovely. Could not recommend more.",1.0
"This is one of my favorite US-filter sunscreens. Rubs in easily, doesn’t pill or feel heavy after sweating or just going through the day. Price point is amazing, and I prefer it to similarly priced sunscreens at the drugstore. Can’t beat a Korean formulation.",1.0
I’m obsessed with fresh lip balms they look and feel so luxurious. This one has a tint to it and very buildable and pigmented. I did find that it doesn’t smell like peony’s to me it smells more clean. I wanna buy every lip balm from them they are so moisturizing I was gifted by fresh,1.0
"I was given this product for free to give an honest review on. I really like this product, my eyes feel so soft and smooth. I also liked the scent of it, it is very soft and not overpowering.",1.0
Received a sample for my order. This smells like the alcoholic wipes that they give in the plane. I didn’t not notice any difference in my skin.,0.0
"After a couple uses, I felt continuous hydration throughout the entire day. I noticed my skin became more smooth as a result of applying this cream. I started to include this cream in my nightly routine about a week ago.",1.0
"This lip balm goes on very smooth on the lips. It’s very long lasting. It’s very nourishing and has really helped soothed my dry and cracked lips. It smells so good, wish I could eat it. I would definitely buy this again in other scents.",1.0
"I used this every day for 4 months until it ran out, hoping for something to happen but I can honestly say that say it did absolutely nothing for me - no brightening, no improvement, no impact. It smells like juice and left my skin sticky as if I were putting Capri Sun on my skin. Used with Tatcha Essence and Water Cream.",0.0
Didn’t do anything. Felt like I just placed a sticker on my face.,0.0
"It caused my skin to burn, I think because of the fragrance.",0.0
"I have very dry/sensitive skin, and credit where credit is due, I can use this here-and-there. My face isn’t handling 2x a day too well with it as it’s drying it out a bit much.  The scent is also a little offputting, but it goes away quickly.  A solid product for skin types like mine—just not  all day every day.",1.0
"I’m so happy I gave this serum a try. It was gifted by Glow Recipe, and I couldn’t be happier. It absorbs great into the skin great. I use it over my make up, but I love the fact that can be used under as well. The texture is perfect. My skin feels and looks great after using glow recipe.",1.0
I got this free to #try with topbox# .I used it at night only it moisturized my dry skin pretty well .My eyes looked hydrated in the morning .I used it for 4 days .can’t say much about my wrinkles .It’s was nice to try .,1.0
"I love this Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream! I found it very easy to add into my skincare routine. It absorbs well into the skin so you don’t feel it there shortly after application.  I am 42 years old and starting to show some wrinkles around my eyes. This cream helped smooth those out. I look and feel younger.  The cream really doesn’t have much of a fragrance to it, so perfect for those that prefer unscented items. Overall I think this item is great for your anti-aging skincare routine.",1.0
"I was gifted this product by  Dermalogica sampling. This product is in powder form. So it’s easy to carry and great for traveling. I was scared to use it if my skin would feel sensitive. Surprisingly, it’s gentle compared to other exfoliate cleansers. My skin felt clearer and refreshed.",1.0
"Not for dry skin, specially when you already have good skin. The description said it could be used on dry skin but my skin is now so flaky and patchy after two days of use. I wish I had never used it...I want my smooth skin back.",0.0
It was really hard to get out of the bottle and really didn’t do anything for my skin,0.0
"These tanning drops are the best! I am very fair so I don’t tan (real or fake) very well. These drops give me a nice glow. I love that I can mix it with my own moisturizer (face or body) and put as little or as much as I want. There is a bit of a scent but it doesn’t bother me. Overall, this product is awesome!",1.0
"I use a lot of Drunk Elephant products, and this is the only one I really didn’t like. I felt like it left my lips more dry and chapped than other drug store products. Oh well!",0.0
"I wanted to like this since I like most things from the Inkey List. No matter how hard I shook the item, the balm and oil components never quite mixed. I had do squeeze really hard to get much balm, especially after a few uses. As a make-up removing product, it’s fine. I was using a drug store one before and will go back to that after finishing this product. At least the drugstore one was easier to use and cheaper for the same result.",0.0
There is nothing watery about this moisturizer and true essence it is indeed a cream! Richer and best suited for dry skin! If you have combination or oil skin like myself - I will refrain. I have gone through two samples of these and will not give it another try.,0.0
"This is so fragrant, I was honestly disappointed it did not smell of honey. It did not moisture, and actually stung some irritation I had on my cheek. That’s because alcohol is 5th in the ingredient lineup. For the cost I would expect more. Yes it massaged in nicely but with combo skin, I’d wake up greasy in the morning. Not for me.",0.0
"I haven’t been using I cream for about a month so when I first started using this I did notice a difference most likely due to the lack of hydration. At first, it made my under eyes look and feel so hydrated, even when I wore concealer. Never looked better. After a few days my eyes did start to get irritated most likely due to the retinoid. Scaling back on how many days in a row. Drunk elephant C Tango is the best I have ever used, literally life changing. Going back to that.",0.0
"I received this from Influenster to review. Although I love the idea, I’m not sure I would purchase this on the regular. I have used more healing lip balms, but a night mask is convenient because it doesn’t get in the way of food and such. No scent or flavor is good as well if you like lip balms to be simple.",1.0
I have received this as a product for free from Influenster and I really enjoyed it. The only downfall is that it smells a little weird.,1.0
"Now, I don’t exactly like this oil for my entire face, but I do seriously adore this for my eyelids! The skin around my eyes can get extremely painfully dry and damaged, but ever since I started using this about a year ago, I have never had that problem since! I have used many eye creams, and almost all of them don’t help the problem, in fact many make it worse.  This oil however, I used the tinest little droplet rub it between two fingers and apply to my eyes, and my eyes are so hydrated and healthy and not irritated and not dry! It isn’t greasy either which is the best part because I really love doing makeup and bright eyeshadows and such, and this does not effect my eye makeup at all. I’ve been using the same bottle for a year now, with still TONS of product left with twice a day use. I highly recommend this. Its the best bang for my buck and just works wonders on my skin! I highly recommend especially if you have any possible dry patches anywhere or just a very dry face overall.",1.0
It’s nice but the smell is v strong and the balm isn’t long lasting.  Also I’ve realized I don’t like having to dig my fingers into pots soooo there’s that.  Mistake on my part.,0.0
I don’t think I’d say I’ve noticed any major changes as a result of using this product however my skin feels softer and has what I would call an overall more even texture. I like how it feels when I apply it even though the scent is a little too perfume-y to me. I would call this product a nice to have but not an essential part of my routine.,1.0
Wouldn’t recommend this product to anybody who is allergic to sensitive to fragrance. I haven’t seen any difference in my skin. Rather irritation. Disclaimer: If you still want to give it a try go ahead. Everyone’s skin is different.,0.0
"This little lip sleeping mask is awesome. I love the feel on my lips, the cute packaging, and the scent of the the product. I used to just wear regular chapstick at night but this is a nice alternative. I’ve been wearing it at night - not sure if it has improved my lips, but definitely hasn’t changed them for the worse at all. Received this for testing purposes on Influenster.",1.0
"I sweat...A LOT...I also get hot very easily.  This means I have a very difficult time finding a moisturizer that actually moisturizes but doesn’t make my face sweat even more.  This finally did the trick!  I got it first as sample in my Play box & immediately went out to buy the full size.  It does a great job at keeping my skin smooth & moisturized without feeling heavy on my face.  Not sticky, no residue, & it doesn’t make me break out even though I have sensitive skin.  THANK YOU BELIF!!!",1.0
"i heard so many great reviews, but this dried my skin out so badly! i have really oily skin, and this just made it do a full 180!",0.0
"I love that this serum doesn’t have a fragrance but also doesn’t smell terrible (like some unscented skin care). It’s a thick enough consistency to apply easily and absorbs quickly. However, I think that you can obtain the same results from a lower priced alternative.",0.0
This has been a staple in my routine for months as I started using it in the dry winter months because my skin was dehydrated and this is very hydrating. I like to use this as my final step in my nightime routine and then I wake up with my face feeling nice and plump.,1.0
Would have liked a bit more moisture but it is pretty nice and hydrating! Used about a weeks worth and I found out they weren’t cruelty free :( they test on animals in China so I’m going to drop this and switch to something else,0.0
I received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. I was pleasantly surprised by it. It’s hydrating and absorbs into the skin quickly. It’s more of a toner consistency so it feels nice and refreshing. I would definitely recommend for all skin types.,1.0
I received a free sample with my last order and thought I would just give it a try. As soon as it touched my face it felt like a dozen papercuts burning all over. I have sensitive skin but I have been building up my usage of actives over the past year with Dr. Gross AHA/BHA wipes so I thought I would be OK. If you have sensitive skin this is a HARD pass!,0.0
"Nothing special, regular wash... Does nothing to my skin.",0.0
"Very nice formula with just enough sting so that you know it’s working. If you’re choosing between this and a pricier competitor product, I recommend this one ;). I don’t get a glow but I do have nice resurfacing with this product.",1.0
Tasty and smells great. Waking up to nice soft lips.,1.0
I have used this product many times before and always find myself coming back to it. I have combination and very sensitive skin. It t have a lightweight and fragrance free formula which does not  clog my pores. I really cant recommend this product more than I do to family. Definitely give it a try.,1.0
"I purchased this in the end of June and I’ve worn it most days since then.  I’m not sure what skincare benefits it has had, but it’s looked lovely on my skin, so I didn’t care.  I’ve mixed it with Protini, C-Firma, and Umbra.But today, after under 3 weeks of using it, I noticed that it stained the side of my glasses.  My glasses are baby blue and there is a distinct stain from where my glasses touch my face.  NOTHING cleaned it off my glasses.I would be concerned about using this if you wore clear glasses as it could stain them, and that would be visible.I will be returning this because it concerns me that there’s an ingredient that is staining my glasses.  I have never experienced this with ANY product in my life, and I’ve been wearing glasses for over 15 years.",0.0
I got this for my mom to try and she really loves it.,1.0
"I had high hopes for this moisturizer, but I didn’t like it at all. It didn’t absorb into my skin. It just kinda sat on top and dried feeling tacky. It also made me breakout. Not a fan.",0.0
This product was wonderful and gentle on my skin left my skin feeling super clean and helped with my nose area which is my trouble area of my face. Happy I received this product complimentary from innisfree.,1.0
This product is FANTASTIC. It makes my combination skin soft and supple when I use it regularly. It helps my husband’s oily skin stay balanced and even my pre-teen’s very irritated skin feels so much better when she uses it regularly. Truly impressed with the versatility AND it smells amazing so it helps soothe my senses as well as my skin. I’ve upgraded to the bigger size since the whole family is basically using it now.,1.0
"I am allergic to adhesives (and latex) like medical tape and bandaids so I was a little worried about if I’d have a reaction to these, especially since you need to wear them 4-6 hours, but six hours later: MAGIC! No reaction redness or peeling skin! And the zit was noticeably smaller!These are one of my favorite products and even though they are a little pricy, I think they are worth it when I have a Zit Volcano growing.",1.0
I received this complimentary from GOOPGLOW. And I love it.  Simple and easy to use and feels great while it is on. Leave it on over night while you sleep and washed if off when I woke up.  My skin is feeling so soft and my face looks so radiant. It has a nice smell that is not to strong which is a plus since anything with strong smells is hard to keep on my face as I have the need to wash it off before it works. My face never felt and look as good as it does right now.,1.0
"I typically don’t use eye creams so was super excited to be able to try this product out! I used this in the PM and when I’d wake up my eyes would feel moisturized. I also noticed it improved my concealer application, my under eyes creased a lot less than usual. I’d definitely recommend this product if you feel like splurging on something a bit more pricey.",1.0
The product itself feels a little bit too much like play doe its kind of hard wash off it. It doesn’t really feel like my skin is being washed however it is good at taking off sunscreen. Micellar water is better for makeup removal.I would give this 3 stars however the packaging is just absolutely horrible. I can’t even squeeze the product out of the tube it doesn’t come out and it hardens way to easily. I love the inky list but I dont really like this cleanser. It would be a lot better if they packaged this product into a jar instead of a tube.,0.0
It’s okay lotion but for the price u could get better .,0.0
Omg. I thought this was a perfume I had to double check the label. This strong of a fragrance does not belong on the face.,0.0
This is a great facial sun screen! Not greasy at all and works well under makeup!,1.0
"I really wanted to like this since so many Instagram influencers raves about it but I feel like I wasted my money after buying it... to be honest it did nothing for my face. When I first used it, I thought my face was glowing in the morning but it’s only because there is the jet lag mask’s residue still on my face after washing my face. It also broke me out in random places, but I do have sensitive skin. Overall, it ended up going in the trash..",0.0
This feels like washing your face with grease. absolutely awful. Didn’t even get the rest of my mascara off.,0.0
returning today. The very nice young man working face products that day told me this and another Riley product would help with bags under my eyes due to drastic weight loss. Didn’t work at all. He told me to wait 2 weeks to see results 3 weeks later no difference.,0.0
"I had been wanting to try this product for a long time after hearing such great things about it. Maybe it’s because I don’t typically wear any foundation or color-correcting product other than a tinted moisturizer, but this seemed to settle in all the lines and textures of my face. I do typically have dry skin so that most likely made it look worse. Very odd texture, almost like clay. It did do it’s job neutralizing some of the redness of my skin but I couldn’t get past how it looked up close.",0.0
This really works! I had this product put on me while I was having a service done and honestly it worked instantly. The balm just melted into my dry chapped lips and became so soft. I use it every night. Worth every dollar.,1.0
"I’ve seen it mentioned in other reviews, and I understand everyone’s frustrations now. With washing my face like I normally have done for years, this one always got in mouth and tasted horrible. I’ve never had this experience with any other cleanser! I tried avoiding the mouth area and it still happened and I’d have to spit it out. I also wasn’t impressed with its ability to remove eye makeup, which was my main reason for buying an oil cleanser. My makeup was waterproof liner and regular mascara, all it did was smudge it around and not help rinse it all off. I wasn’t a fan of the citrus fragrance, though that might be a plus for some. I’ll be returning this unfortunately",0.0
This eye serum is so nice. I am very picky about eye serums and creams. This one seems to really work and feels so nicely when applied. So far I really like it.,1.0
I wanted to love these products so badly but I would not recommend if you have Rosacea. These products caused a really bad flare up for me. Love the smell and packaging though.,0.0
"Nope do not do not. Because i always love every product from sephora but this oh no its just an oil under your eyes thats about it, with no cooling affect whatsoever.I just wasted my money",0.0

Absolutely love this exfoliant! I have been using derma Logica for many years now I know I can always trust them for high-quality products that are suitable for my sensitive acne prone skin! This is a unique product that makes your skin feel amazing afterwards smoother and brighter and more clear!,1.0
"Originally got this as a free sample, was not looking for a makeup remover at all (I just used concealer), but I LOVED this! So easy and effective, I am converted.",1.0
"Alright so I’ve wanted this product for a while. I’ve read both good and bad reviews but was remaining optimistic. When I opened I noticed that the plastic seal on top had a bunch of spots on it. The colour is darker than green. The smell, is rancid. It smells like heavy floral perfume/mold/chemicals. Even after all that I gave it a shot. I don’t have sensitive skin so I was at the 13 minute mark and the smell was giving me a headache and my skin was feeling hot. I immediately washed it off and my skin was red where the mask was. I’m positive something is wrong with this mask. Maybe not all of them, but this one for sure.",0.0
"Love this stuff, stumbled across this years ago at my local Sephora store, was given a sample and was in love. I use this cream, the cleanser, and the goji oil perfect for my older skin. That said I know this lotion would not have worked for my younger skin",1.0
I put this on after washing my face around 11 am and by the time it was 4 pm I have to wipe it off because it turned SO greasy. It does feel like whenever you put it on at first but gets so gross after a few hours. I have combo skin but even my forehead which is super dry was slick with greasy. I was definitely worried it would clog my pores.,0.0
I love the smell and texture and outcome of this!  My gripe though is this lasted me only a coupleOf months!!  I used it often but defenitley not so much that it should be gone so quickly!,0.0
"Believe the hype. This smells great and actually works! Definitely gooey which is fine because you’re using it before bed. Comes with an adorable little spatula for application that I expect to lose, but I’m sure a Q-Tip will work just fine.",1.0
"Loving Confidence in a Cream!!! I started using this after getting a little too much sun and am so thankful that I’ve had it to rescue my skin this summer!  It’s super moisturizing, goes on evenly and absorbs quickly.  I love that it doesn’t have a scent and a little goes a long way because it’s very hydrating.  Definitely going to make sure I have plenty stocked up for the cooler months when that dry winter skin hits and totally sharing with my family and friends so we can all be hydrated and glowy!",1.0
"I can’t believe I waited so long to try this! It feels great, doesn’t have any weird taste, doesn’t give me a sore throat, works well. This is exactly what I’ve been looking for. I keep it by my bed and use it every night. I wake up every morning w/ my lips not dry.",1.0
"Buying a matte moisturizer for someone with dry skin is probably not the best idea, but it says it’s for all skin types. It leaves me constantly needing to reapply moisturizer several times a day, which is a shame because this stuff isn’t cheap and you only get a tiny amount.  Also it has essential oils in it, which are bad for sensitive skin. This stuff makes my skin sting. The smell is very strong. I would advise anyone with dry or sensitive skin to stay away from this product.",0.0
"Disappointed as this cream makes my skin break out, oddly. I do like the texture, and that it’s unscented/mildly scented but it’s not worth my using since it doesn’t agree with my skin.",0.0
"Since I purchased the Tatcha skincare, I have been doing some extensive research. I purchased the Deep Cleanse, The Dewy Skin Cream and the Pure One Step Camellia Oil. I really enjoy doing a double cleanse at night, so I use the One Step Camellia Oil and then the Deep Cleanse. The Oil takes off all my make up and I feel hydrated and the Deep Cleanse feels like a luxury facial cleanser, my face feels clean and I am enjoying it. I then follow the cleanse with some additional products and then the face cream. I intended on using the face cream during the day, although, for me, it is a bit too “dewy“ for daytime. Will I be spending the money again on either of these products? No.Almost any cleansing balm or oil will do the trick and I can’t see myself paying more than $20 next time I buy it. The Tatcha does only require one pump, so I don’t think it’s that pricey, although, I think that there are better, cleaner products out there. Tatcha uses fragrance in their products, which is not good in your skincare.Previously I was using Farmacy’s Green Clean Balm and Dr. Brandt’s Cream Cleanser. My cleansing experience didn’t feel as luxurious, although, I believe that my skin was absolutely in the same state that it is in now.",0.0
i didnt notice a difference in my skin since trying it. maybe my eyes are just decieving me.,1.0
This stuff is amazingg! It’s smells good and it leaves the skin feeling great once applied! I have combination skin and lately it’s been dry and this has definitely helped!,1.0
it was good at first. legt a nice glowing look but it dies go away within the hour and for how much you get for the price i wouldnt say its worth it,0.0
I have never used an essence before and didn’t realize the value that it would add to my skincare routine. I have very oily skin but it is also very dry in the winter and this essence added some much needed hydration. I am not sure if it really affects the efficacy of my actives but it does feel really nice and seems to plump my skin. I will continue to use this until it runs out as I love the way it makes my skin feel. I received this complimentary to try and I am so thankful that I did as I have fallen in love with it!,1.0
"Feels like an oily wax and cleans heavy makeup well. However, it doesn’t really get deep into the skin, so I would recommend using a facial wash after this. It’s nice, but not quite a full cleanser",1.0

"I’ve been using this exfoliator during my pm skincare routine for about a week now and honestly don’t see what all the rave reviews are about. I think it works as well as any exfoliator should and is very natural (smells like rice), but I haven’t seen a noticeable change to my skins texture that I would expect from such an expensive product. Would probably be really good for sensitive skin. I have previously used the Kate Somerville Exfoliator and loved it and probably will end up going back to it. Debating returning this one as I don’t think it’s worth the price.",0.0
"I put this eye cream around my left eye and put SK2 eye cream around my right eye for two days. It was obvious, my right eye bag looked much better than left. My skin around left eye even had wrinkles and it was very dry compared to the right side. It is affordable price, however it doesn’t work at all.",0.0
"I don’t understand how this product is so hyped. I love how it feels and the 40 SPF. The big downfall is that I have very dry skin, I get eczema on my body and face. This sunscreen converted my face Into the most oilest land field out there. I started setting it with powder and within two hours I was so oily. Let’s not even talk about it under foundation. It became embarrassing when my family and friends started asking me if I was okay because I looked so “sweaty”. I would only use a pea size. Never again",0.0

So gentle and I love the smell. It works like any other cleansing oil (if you’re familiar with them) but this one smells wonderful and actually foams up a bit with water! I follow with Tatcha’s rice enzyme powder or recently switched to Amore Pacific enzyme peel. I liked Amore’s powder better.,1.0
"I had high hopes, but from my experience, it was just okay.. I was given a week sample but a little does go a long way! I was able to use it nightly for about 2 weeks. Sadly, during this time I noticed no difference... Maybe after a month or more, but from what I got I didn’t see any change at all... My skin still was smooth when I woke up so I guess that could be a plus?",0.0
Really enjoying this moisturizer for my winter face cream. Is is rich and rather thick which my dry skin is really enjoying in the cold winter months. It smells slightly like lemon to me but the scent doesn’t seem to irritate my skin at all. Really like this under makeup or at night before bed! Also enjoy the packaing!,1.0
"DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL left my skin feeling smooth. It mostly just cleaned my face. I’m 29 and for some reason it didn’t do much other than make my face smooth. When applying the product it does have a little sting to it, but not enough to irritate your skin. If you have any blemishes it also with help clear your skin. Overall it’s not worth the money, maybe I just didn’t receive enough free samples to get the entire effect?",0.0
I received this product for free with Influenster and I’m so happy with it. The smell is so nostalgic for me. It exfoliates enough for my sensitive skin so I like that it’s not too rough. You can literally feel you dead skin ball up from using it so you know it’s working. I will definitely buy this when I run out. Would absolutely recommend for someone that has sensitive skin,1.0
This product gave me tiny little bumps. Terrible.,0.0
"In love with this stuff! I also got it for my birthday in sample size and it’s amazing. I just apply while I’m in the shower to clean my face because I usually use a make up wipe to get majority of my make up off first. Sadly, I never have really had a good skin care regimen and this was the perfect time to start. It makes my face feel so clean & soft & the protini polypeptide cream paired with it makes the results even better! I will definitely be purchasing this cleanser once  I run out of the sample tube! Would recommend this 100x over!",1.0
Honestly it feels good on the lips but doesn’t last overnight. Vaseline does the same thing without the pretty packaging and scent. Overpriced lipgloss,0.0
"I have SUPER oily skin. Though the cream makes my skin softer and more hydrated the next morning, it does sit on my face and makes me shinier the same time. I don’t see the de-stressing effect as much as I had expected. Just not for me but must be perfect for dry/normal skin!!",0.0
"I wanted to like this for the price point and clinical ingredients, but it pills with the Ordinary Vitamin C and doesn’t absorb immediately. Eventually it will absorb, but my dry skin still feels dry afterwards. I don’t think there is enough moisturizer for me in this formula.",0.0
"This product is simply spectacular! It melts so easily on the face and removes makeup in SECONDS. It smells very earthy and refreshing. A little goes a long way. I used to use the Drunk Elephant makeup removing balm, but this is a step-up (and cheaper)! A hundred percent recommend.",1.0
Love Tatcha!! will definitely purchase again.,1.0
Received as a gift from a wish list. It’s overpriced and overrated. Not worth it,0.0
"I don’t know why people are raving, maybe I didn’t do something just right? The color stays green and sure my skin doesn’t look red anymore but now it looks oddly green/grey? I think the formula is very streaky and hard to blend too which doesn’t help the strange appearance.",0.0
"Wish I loved it :( Got three bottles as a gift for Christmas. Used for a few days morning and night and felt it dried my skin, woke and my face looked dull, no glow or shine. I guess everyone’s skins type is different. I think you can achieve the same results using a not so expensive product. There are so many wonderful moisturizers out there that won’t cost you as much and do the same maybe even better.",0.0
"I bought thinking it was a face wash, should have read better. I ended up keeping it an i don’t care for it in gets the makeup in my contact and I never had this problem using ponds cream makeup remover and cerave face wash. It also doesn’t do great at getting makeup all off around my eyes. Just buy ponds that stuffs great.",0.0
"We use this to take off competition make up. It melts everything right off. It is pretty oily, so you need to be able to wash your face right afterwards. But, it definitely gets the hard to get matte lip sticks and eye make up off.",1.0
I’ve been using this for a little under a week from a sample I got and I love it! It absorbs really quickly without making my face feel sticky. My skin feels so soft and looks a bit more even now,1.0
"It’s taken me almost two years to actually use all of this product. It leaves you feeling like a greasy mess after washing it off. My family literally feels like I’ve slept in makeup in 100° weather and I can feel my pores start to clog up. I’ve told myself i can’t buy a new one until i use this up because it was so bloody expensive, and i dread washing my face at night to take my spf and makeup off.",0.0
Result from this scrub is amazing! You see how the smooth get smoother and most of all it looks so much brighter! The scrub grain is so fine it is even great for those with sensitive skin. Most exfoliators break me out due to its super rough texture that do more harm on my sensitive than good. I am so happy I finally found effective exfoliator from clean beauty!⁣⁣ I recorded live result on my IG @emilie_life_edited as a reel.,1.0
Love this face oil. Keeps me hydrated without looking greasy!,1.0
"The sunscreen stick is amazing for the summer time! I love using it for times I won’t be using makeup: going to the beach, outdoor activities, hiking. It provides great coverage and is super easy to reapply.",1.0

Trust me you will love this lip sleep sleeping mask! Your lips will be plump and soft next day. I apply a generous amount and I love the way my lips feel and look that morning. A definite must have!,1.0
"I wanted to love this product. Pros- It definitely hydrates and you get a ton of product, even though the jar looks small. Con- I have used it off and on for 8 months and my skin breaks out when I use this product. When I stop using the product my skin stops breaking out. Maybe it’s just me?? I’ll be buying tried and true DE products from now on.",0.0
"Since starting early menopause, my lips dry out SO badly once a month when hormones dip. I have literally tried over 50 different balms and salves to try and get rid of the scaly, flaky mess. This has been the ONLY thing that has worked - and it works beautifully! I use it during the day time as a balm, and load up on it at night time. SO in love with this.",1.0
love this stuff. it works great! I feel like it hydrates my skin with out leaving it greasy. and it also has like a cooling sensation that feels amazing on the skin. I highly recommend,0.0
"I don’t really write reviews but I have to say I’m happy with this moisturizer!I’m 38 yrs old and hard to find a good one for my oily AND dry areas on my face,but this works well under make-up or no make-up.I see a difference within 2-3 days and really happy how my skin looks when i wake up! So glad it doesn’t break out my skin!",1.0
"This moisturizer sucks! I have acne prone, combination skin and it made me break out, oily and it doesn’t keep skin moisturized for a long time. It’s also not blendable.  I have tried kiehls and it’s a lot better than this. onlthing I like",0.0
"i LOVE this stuff! aside from it smelling delicious and feeling great on your skin, its super moisturizing!",1.0
"I got this a couple weeks after buying the Ole dark spot toner because I wanted to use that one at night and this one in the mornings. I love this one so, so much! It smells so good and makes my skin feel and look better. If I have a blemish, I take a cotton pad and put some of the toner on it and let it sit on my face for 10 minutes. The next morning, my blemish looks way better and usually reduces size! 11/10 recommend this toner, especially to people who have more oily skin. It has helped with my oil tremendously.",1.0
it has a nice orange/citrus scent. I use it twice a week and have noticed my pores look smaller,1.0
Not effective at all and also too big that they’ve to be cut down to fit problem areas. The nose strip caused a breakout for me as it was too heavy and tight on my skin causing a pimple right around its contours.,0.0
"This is such a great product! Not too heavy, but definitely very moisturizing. I love the natural vibe of this brand!",1.0
This product was just all right. Nothing too special about it. I normally use a light hydrating gel moisturizer and this one is more of a thicker consistency. I have oily skin and my normal moisturizer doesn’t make me oilier but this left me feeling greasy. It also broke me out is weird little bumps after using it once. I received this complimentary for reviewing purposes.,0.0
I was really struggling with acne scars and uneven skin tone and this toner was literally a miracle worker. I love it so much and don’t think I’ll ever let go. I will say that it does make your skin sensitive so be sure to buy sunscreen if you’re thinking about getting this toner! Also noticed that I had to use every other day in the beginning so my skin didn’t feel stripped. I use it nightly now and my scars are almost little to none!,1.0
This product came in such beautiful packaging.  The feel and texture of the product was really nice.  There was no skin irritation and I’m able to use every day this is a huge difference from other over the counter or prescription products,1.0
"The product packaging looks nice and bright. The scent of the product smells lovely. Does it work? I do not believe it’s a great exfoliant, but it tries. My skin feels a little smoother. To feel it working, I let product sit on my dry and clean face for like a 1 1/2 min and then I proceed to follow the instructions.",0.0
"So when I first got the product and was reading about it, I thought it was going to have a really fresh citrus-y pineapple smell. I was wrong. It is scented but it’s not too strong and it doesn’t smell like pineapple. It’s different than other exfoliators I’ve used. It almost makes the dead skin roll off your face. I will say my face did feel super soft and bright afterwards. I’m not sure I’d buy it once released because it is pricey and I’ve used other exfoliators that are cleaner and more effective for cheaper. I did get this free to try through influencer and voxbox",1.0
"I received this as a free sample from Influenster. I tried it and by the third night, my skin around my mouth got red and flaky. Very dry. I stopped using it and everything cleared up in about a week.",0.0
#belifbff #complimentary @belifusa @InfluensterI received this sample for review from Influenster. While I wish I could give it a positive review I simply cannot. I discontinued my other night lip mask and used just this for 2 weeks and my lips have never been more chapped. I simply do not think that this does anything. And on the lips when it has been on the lips for some time it begins to ball up in little sections instead of sinking into the lips. I have since stopped using for the past week using my Aquaphor along and my lips are back to normal.,0.0
Really wanted to love this but it almost was too dark for my pale skin.,0.0
I received a sample size of this product for review. I used it! for about a week and my skin felt more hydrated and radiant while using it. I didn’t notice any other benefits and I feel it’s because I need to use if for a longer period of time in order to experience a significant change.,1.0
Not impressed for the money I get very oily shortly after I had better results with Peter Thomas Roth cloud cream,0.0

I love fresh products and I was super excited to try it out but the first thing I saw on the ingredients was fragrance. I only use fragrance free on my face so I let my sister use it and she liked it. Not her staple face wash but it’s okay. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,0.0
"I heard lot good about this product but for me, it doesn’t work, not even 5%, very expensive, I expected but Unfortunately not worth for me",0.0
"I gave it 1 star for the package, the press to dispense flat top is really convenience. The cream itself felt nice at application. I have dry skin, and this cream made my face feel cracking, and itchy, and it get worse everytime I used it. I didn’t save the receipt and couldn’t return it.",0.0
"The product itself works very well, but ugh it smells really strong... I don’t think I would repurchase it based on the smell, maybe it’s just me though",0.0
"One of the best cleansers I’ve ever used. Gel to foam. Nice scent, light, doesn’t dry out skin. Good for everyday cleanser! Bought mini size and bought full size shortly after trying it!",1.0
"I received the Original Skin Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. The moisturizer is light but not greasy or slimy feeling. It has a light, almost citrusy scent that was nice. Not too sweet or overbearing. It absorbed well into my skin and didn’t take a long time to dry. My skin almost felt powdery smooth after applying. It didn’t make me break out either which is good. All in all, I would recommend this product.",1.0
This felt soft and all but I think I was having a reaction to it. I know it isn’t my other skincare products because they work well but I think this cleanser made my face kinda red and made my cheeks feel hot a little bit. I have sensitive kin btw.,0.0
I was recently gifted by GoopGlow this Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliater for my honest opinion. I can honestly say that I love it! It is easy to use and leaves your skin feeling so moisturized. The exfoliation is really fine and gentle on the skin.  The texture is very goopy and it feels amazing on and once it’s rinsed also! I definitely recommend it!,1.0
"Instantly dissolved makeup, no longer will I have to scrub away at stuck on mascara.",1.0
"Overall this is an ok cleanser. I have only used this in the summer when my skin is more normal. It does not leave the skin feeling overly stripped but does get it clean. However, the beads really do not add much for me. There are too few for them to be really exfoliating and they are huge. The packaging is also horrible. It is very difficult to get the last bit out and squeezing the bottle gives you limited control over how much comes out. They should really put this in a pump.",0.0
"I have lips that constantly need moisture.  I don’t go anywhere without lip balm.  I was excited to try this.  It is just OK.  For the price, it is definitely NOT worth it.  I find my self reapplying often.  I usually use bobby brown lip tin but didn’t want a product I have to dip my finger in to use, so I switched to this.  I honestly think chapstick is better!",0.0
This is a really great product. I like it quite a lot and would recommend it to all,1.0
Used this product as a facemask. Left my skin feeling softer but not sure if it is something I would use again,0.0
I got this gift by Fresh. This cream will moisturize effectively for 72 hours with strengthening damask rose extract . I can’t agree more，My nose peels easily，It does not peel and is very moisturizing,1.0
"Great product, after consistent use my skin was plumper and more moisturized. This did not cause breakouts and it’s lightly dented.  It’s a good value for the price.  I highly recommend it.",1.0
One of the best chapsticks I’ve ever tried. The price is totally worth it. It doesn’t make them more chapped like other do & a little goes a long way! It’s a must!,1.0
I love the texture of this mask and that it is a multitasking product. It can be left on overnight as a sleeping mask or washed off after 15 to 20 minutes. It left my face with a noticeable glow and smoothness. I would purchase this product again,1.0
"This advertises as a primer as well as a sunblack, so I thought this would be good for someone with oily skin.  However, everytime I have put on, I feel extremely oily by the end of the day versus when I put other sunscreens or no sunscreen on. I bought in the summer and thought it was due to my skin being more oily in the heat but I have recntl tried using it again and found it still makes my skin very oily.   I do not recommend this, it you have oily skin.",0.0
I have tried many different skincare products and creams and was very impressed with this one. A Sephora cast member recommended it to me during the VIB sale as I was looking for clean moisturizer product with added anti age benefits. I have normal skin - not prone to breakouts and not dry or oily in the summer months. It has a beautiful light texture with interesting jar to not let the air damage the ingredients in the package. I’ve only been using it a few weeks but although I like this feature it will make it hard to know when I’m getting low. The product goes on nicely and is very refreshing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and glowing. I start to see lines on my forehead and smile lines so also bought this cream to reduce the appearance which in immediate application works!  My first Drunk Elephant purchase but will intrigued to try out some others now!,1.0
"I gave this 3 stars because it isn’t a bad product but did not work for my skin type for whatever reason. After using it my skin felt very clean and nice, I enjoyed the smell but it made me break out. Not like an allergic reaction but in random pimples and I know sometimes your skin goes through a purge but I used the product for 2 weeks and my skin never cleared up. I have dry to normal skin and a product that works well for me is the cerave hydrating facial cleanser. I wanted to like this but it just didn’t work sadly.",0.0
"This cleanser promises soft skin and it delivers. Although I am not a fan of its texture upon application, it always leave my skin feeling smooth and supple. I have been using this product a little over a month now, replacing my usual cleanser. I have seen a real difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. If you’re looking for a luxurious experience with a powerful cleanser, this product is for you.",1.0
"When I use this face base before I apply my foundation, I can always tell a big difference. My skin feels very moisturized (but not oily), which makes a huge difference). My foundation looks so much better when I apply the face base. I love that it also has vitamin B, C and E which adds essential nourishments to the skin.",1.0

"Thank you Top box for the #freeproductI recieved a good size sample to try this serum. Sample lasted me for a week. I had to apply little extra as I have dry skin. This serum leaves my skin soft, smooth and silky. No greasy feeling as it absorbs right into the skin. I used this serum during my nightly routine after face wash. I will be buying the full size as I like Clinique product line.",1.0

"Great moisturizer for dry skin, usually use it at night for the last step in my night time routine.",1.0
"This cleanser was okay. Even when I washed it off, my skin was left oily. On the other hand, it did not break me out and calmed my acne.",1.0
"I absolutely love this product. I use it daily and pair it with the Farmacy night serum every other night and within a week, my skin has almost completely cleared. My dull winter skin is bright and evenly textured again. I cannot recommend this product enough - the all natural ingredients smell amazing and have completely balanced my previous dry and oily combo skin.",1.0
"It’s worth the hype. I’m in my 40’s and hate when I wake up with dry lips. With this, I was up with plump, soft lips every time. It’s worth the cost & I’ve tried so many other options. I got a sample size and use that for travel. The Sweet Candy scent is light & gives me a natural, rosey-pink tone.",1.0
"I like it but, it’s been marketed as a scrub that scrubs off the dead skin. The crumbs that I get are not my dead skin. It’s the product itself. It’s too expensive or what much of a product. I ordered 100ml one yet I thought I ordered the small size when I received it. That’s much much I was disappointed.",0.0
"I started using the cleanser earlier this week and have enjoyed using it. It smells very refreshing, and the smell makes me feel like I’m at a spa (which sounds so nice right about now)! It has left my skin feeling great, but I don’t know how hydrating the cleanser is. I think it’s a great product at a fair price and would recommend it to friends/family.",1.0
This is not a new product to me. I’ve tried this essence before about 1-2 years ago and my feelings haven’t changed. It’s a really good essence. The consistency is closer to water allowing for deeper penetration and faster absorption. I find it really hydrating and not irritating to my sensitive skin. But it has a hefty price tag and I don’t consider the product to be worth quite that much. There are other really nice essences out there for a less painful price.,1.0
"I was a loyal fan of the old formula for years and years. This new formula is terrible! So oily! Not hydrating, just oily. It just leaves the skin looking oily and feeling oily! And I have dry skin, so imagine that! Please bring back the old formula!",0.0
"I was very skeptical at first, of using an oil to cleanse my face. BUT it is very light and gentle, completely removed all of my makeup and left no residue. The pre-cleansing oil has a wonderful scent as well! I will definitely be keeping this in my daily face routine!!!",1.0
"I really like this essence. It is a bit “thicker” than water so go easy on it. I find that one little splash covers my whole face. I’ve noticed my skin is less red, more hydrated, and softer since using this. It is pricey but it will last 6-7 months at the least, it goes a long long way!",1.0
"After application, this product felt way too sticky and nasty on my face.  I hated the feeling.  I didn’t really see any significant changes to my skin that would justify the gross feeling on my face and the $90 price.",0.0
This product was way to harsh for my sensitive skin. My face felt tight and dry after using this cleansing gel. It felt stripped of all moisture. I developed dry patches and itchiness. I only had the sample sized one and I gave it away.This may work for you if you have oily skin.,0.0
"I had really high hopes for this product, however I wasn’t able to get to see the full 7 day results because the formula was a little too oily for my skin.  I would say that my face is not dry, and more of a combo than oily.  I do not have a very oily complexion, however this felt like i was just placing oil on my face and I did not enjoy the way it felt.  I can see this being great for someone who has dry skin, but it was hard to apply makeup even the next day because my skin felt oily and shiny.  Otherwise the product had a good scent!",1.0
"I really love the smell and consistency of this sunscreen. There is no white cast and it goes on well - as long as you shake before use. Like many others, I prefer this sunscreen for my body as it is pretty oily on my face and has run into my eyes quite a few times and was not pleasant. I received this product complimentary but I look forward to continuing to use this product for applying sunscreen all summer long!",1.0

"I’m so glad I was able to try this product complimentary from La Mer after hearing all the hype around the brand! It is lovely and hydrating, and I enjoy using it. I’m glad a little goes a long way so it will last a while! However, the price is just hard for me to justify, even as a skincare junkie! I’m saving it for special occasions!",1.0
"I had to return this product. Not only is it in effective for the price point, it smells so much like cat urine that I had to wash it off my face the first few times I used it!",0.0
"I really like this moisturizer. It feels super lightweight, but not AS lightweight as a gel moisturizer. It’s a teeny tiny bit thicker, so I really love to use this at night. It leaves my skin immediately looking and feeling so glowy and soft. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I can’t use it under makeup. The first time I had tried, my tinted moisturizer that I’ve used everyday for a couple years wouldn’t sit on my skin like it normally does. It was super patchy and unhappy. That’s totally ok for me though because it’s super normal for people to use different day/night moisturizers anyways! Also, I thought the smell was interesting. It’s not bad at all I don’t think — it smells exactly like the Kate Somerville EradiKate serum! I received this product free or complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0
$18 for 2 weeks worth of product... just NO! Yucky taste too.,0.0
"Beautiful design and color of the bottle for the toner that helps hydrate skin and minimizes the appearance of pores, gentle for daily use.",1.0

"I have been using this at least once a day for about 2 weeks now. I haven’t noticed a visible difference in my skin yet; however, I still like it and will finish the product. A little goes a long way, it is very moisturizing and has no noticeable scent. I love hyaluronic acid and squalane and that this is vegan.",1.0
"This has singlehandedly changed my skin! Dark spots from pimples have all but completely faded, and what is left of them is hardly noticeable. My skin is SO SOFT, and looks visibly less textured. I don’t wear makeup up at all anymore. Definite recommend!!",1.0
"I have extremely sensitive skin. But after going on accutane, my skin is immaculate. I thought this product would be a great introduction to starting a more involved skin care routine. Upon using this and the other products given by voxbox, my skin freaked the heck out. I have tiny under the skin pimples on my forehead (which I never got even before accutane), chin, and jawline. It was so visible and made feel the discomfort I had when I was younger. Everyone is different and I’m sure it’s a cult favorite but it didn’t work for me. I don’t recommend for people with prominent acne or a history of it.",0.0

This has been a bit of a game changer for my excessively oily skin.  Helped regulate and works to make my oil free moisturizer really work to regulate the oil production.,1.0
"I have combo skin and this cream made my skin a little oilier than other creams I have used. It has a nice consistency but it’s not very thick. It’s a good moisturizer, I guess, I haven’t bem given enough time to review it. I can’t say its potent either in terms of fighting wrinkles. It layers well under makeup.",0.0
It’s good on my dry skin just nothing special. I don’t like the packaging it gets messy trying to get it out. I don’t notice any exploiting going on. It does have small beads or whatever but not a whole lot to really exfoliate.,0.0
"Very good cleansing balm! It doesn’t leave residue you need to wipe off after you use it, unlike some makeup removers.",1.0
"This will look great IF AND ONLY IF your skin is already smooth and blemish free. This works and I would love to be able to use this daily to cover up the redness on my cheeks however this will grab onto any imperfection whether it’s dryness, bumps, or lines. I was able to make it work with lots of blending but found that I stopped reaching for this after a 2-3 weeks. Unfortunately my skin just doesn’t agree with this product so I stopped using it.",0.0
"This was a gift from a friend, and a good thing too because I would never have spent so much in so little! The unnecessarily wide stick and soft texture meant I went through it super quickly. 2 months instead of the usual 4  months of other lip balms I use. Also, the packaging is ridiculous! The balm itself is only as deep/tall as the yellow lidded portion, the rest of it is empty! Super wasteful, obviously trying to make you feel like you’re getting more product when in fact it’s only 0.13oz. Not worth the cost!",0.0
"I love this lip mask sooo much!! I put the on at night right before I go to sleep and I’ll wake up with super soft, moisturized lips. A lot of lip balms I’ve tried can’t do that. I like this more than the Bite Agave lip mask because it’s not as thick and sticky but still provides amazing hydration to the lips. This is also great in the day underneath my lipstick. Only downside is I don’t like to bring it out with me during the day because it wouldn’t be very sanitary to reapply when I’m out and about.",1.0
"I really wanted to love this but it did not work out for my skin type. I have dry,sensitive, ezcema prone skin. I used this product three separate times and each time it gave me inflammation and dry flaky skin around my eyes and jaw line. This product was the only new item I added to my nightly routine, so I know it’s the culprit for my flare up.",0.0
"The powder is a little hard to work with but once it’s foamed up, the texture is really lovely on skin. Not too scratchy, not too aggressive - it’s a nice smooth lather with some exfoliating pieces. Overall a nice product, just a little hard to use. It is also REALLY expensive. *gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for honest review",0.0
"I wanted to like this product after reading through all the positive reviews but after a week of using the product, I noticed that I developed small red bumps/pimples on my forehead. I thought it was a hormonal breakout leading up to my period, so I continued to use this toner. The bumps got worse and I switched back to my regular toner (Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, which I’m not in love with since it dries my skin out despite clearing out my acne) for about a week and the bumps went away. After my period, I tried out the REN toner again to see if I’d break out, putting it on in the morning. Later that evening, I noticed the small forehead pimples came back. I will likely exchange what’s left of the product for another toner that is more gentle on my skin.",0.0

"This mask is so good, and the perfect pick-me-up for tired skin. I had surgery last week and ever since I’ve been getting no sleep, and I’ve been too tired to do my regular skincare routine... as you can imagine, my skin was looking pretty rough as a result. I received this mask from Influenster, and honestly after 2 uses my skin is right back to normal, if not better! My eye bags are gone, my colour is back, and I have the nicest, dewiest glow happening. I’m SO happy with how well this mask works. Also, I adore the pump bottle; I’m so used to masks in tubs or squeeze bottles, and they’re always so messy. The pump on this totally eliminates mess. Overall, I think this product is fantastic, especially if your skin is looking a little dull. I received this product free for testing purposes.",1.0
The best I have ever used… seriously. I did not break out. It has the perfect rich consistency.,1.0
"I originally tried this product as a free sample and noticed a smoother appearance to my skin in one use. I was very disappointed when purchasing the 1oz size as the bottle came half empty. It’s also difficult to get the product out with the applicator. With daily now for over two weeks, I have yet to see a difference in my skin. Overall, mixed review.",0.0

"I suffered really badly with cystic acne, but I finally went to the dermatologist and was put on medications to clear up my skin. Thankfully my skin cleared but I was left with a bit of acne scars on my cheeks. I started using this product about two weeks ago and already I notice a huge different in the redness of my scars. It also has evened out my skin tone and brightened my skin. Totally worth the splurge.",1.0

"This mask is really great! I’ve used it a few times since receiving it and I really feel as though it made my skin softer, more supple and more radiant. It also helped me with some texture I was experiencing after having traveled a lot over the past few weeks! Initially the mask was tingling my face, but it’s really nothing bothersome. I also really love the scent! It’s not too strong and really pleasant. I’m happy to have a mask that acts as a chemical exfoliant as I am no longer using physical exfoliators! I’m excited to continue using this product and seeing what it does for my skin. Disclaimer: I received this product for free for testing purposes.",1.0

"I received this product complimentary through Influenster and while i haven’t tried it yet on my face because i have another moisturizer i want to finish first, i did try it on my dry cracked hands before bed. I really liked the texture and feel of it. Not too heavy or greasy at all! Does have a light scent but i did not find it overbearing. Did not cause any irritation and i did notice some relief of my dryness but if my skin on my face was as dry as my hands then i would definitely need something heavier. I look forward to trying on my face soon!",1.0

There is nothing like it!  I have it with me wherever I go.  It’s pure comfort and joy.,1.0
I really like this serum. I use it morning and night.  It really makes my skin smooth and more even. A little goes a long way too. It is expensive but worth it. I tried it as a free sample then after that was gone purchased the 2 pack.,1.0
This felt like rubbing beeswax on my face. It would not spread and did not clean anything off my face.

"this works amazing on my skin, keeps me hydrated all day and my face has a natural glow after using this. I typically use this face cream once in the morning as my final step in my skincare routine and then once in the evening as my final step in my skincare routine ..... I wish there were clearer instructions on the refill though. when I unscrewed the top to remove the empty white tub, I didn’t know I was supposed to also remove the clear plastic part that was attached to the top .... after placing the new tub into the blue holder, I struggled to screw the top back on and it resulted in a waste/loss of A LOT of product. it would be super helpful to include clearer instructions to advise that we ensure the clear plastic piece is also removed when switching out the white tub ... this is my first time using this type of face cream pump so I had no idea I was supposed to remove the clear plastic part. it’s a shame I lost so much of the product because it’s not cheap but it does work amazingly well with my skin.",1.0
This product felt like it coated with lips without hydrating or moisturizing them. This is probably my least favorite product out of the time. Its surely not worth the price tag. My lips were left feeling chapped and greasy without. I was extremely disappointed by this product. This item was sent to me for my consideration from Influester in exchange for my honest review,0.0

I do like the fresh, light citrusy scent and how glowy this makes my skin look immediately! It makes a great base as it’s slightly tacky bio your makeup sticks well.",1.0
"Got this as a gift from my love one and I have tried this for almost two weeks. The main reason he bought me is due to my dry hands caused by the weather. I use this only at night on daily basis and noticed the tremendous improvement just within days. This can be used for many skincare issues and when i noticed that it can be used as a moisturizer, I was thrilled to try it on my face. My face used to have some pimple problems from time to time but recently, my skin around my nose flaked. It seems to be moist enough for my face but I am still observing the result. However, after I applied the oil on my husband’s face (he has flaking issue as well), we could see good result.",1.0

"This pre-cleanse is a great at removing makeup. It is just oily enough (feels like a serum) and it melts thick layers of face makeup away really well. The packaging also helps dispense the product in the best possible way. I will say that it did burn my eyes a little bit when I took off my eye makeup, but maybe with time I will be able to figure out a way around that.",1.0
Love it! It does a great job at removing all of my makeup and it’s soothing to my sensitive skin.,1.0
I really liked this cream. I definitely felt it was more moisturizing than the gel moisturizer from the same line. I have always battled dry skin but I noticed a change after using this cream.  I received this product for free for testing purposes.,1.0
"I’m so disappointed to share that this sadly did not live up to the hype. I bought it due to the rave reviews but upon further inspection most 5 star reviews were from those receiving free samples, not people who purchased this cream. It is moisturizing, but it’s extremely greasy, so I don’t recommend it any time other than immediately before bed, should you forget and touch your face then a screen or book or tv remote etc it’ll leave greasy residue. I’ll be exchanging it for a less greasy lotion. Very disappointed but luckily there are many alternatives out there.",0.0
"I love love love this product. It takes my makeup off like a dream. It’s soothing and calming and gentle enough but works aggressively to get all products off my face.

Bummed I used my $20 off on this. As another reviewer mentioned - doesn’t seem to have any cumulative effect. I bought the day it was released and have been using it for almost a month now. It helps brighten when you first put it on but doesn’t look any different after an hour or so. I use RMS Un Cover-Up and it won’t really apply over this unless I apply it when I get to work an hour or two after.,0.0
love love love! I tried a complimentary tube of this wash and I was blown away! I was skeptical at first because I had never heard of this brand let alone using rice water besides on hair. my skin was super soft afterwards and it seemed like the oil just magically disappeared as well. i love that a little went a long way!,1.0
Feels like it never sinks into the skin. It goes on very creamy. But if you rub your face after about 20 minutes it peels off like it’s a film on the skin that never sunk in. I tried waiting longer. Same thing happened. I have a roller that I use over my skin too. And it would take it off in small pieces and looked like my skin was peeling off. But it was this product !!,0.0

The cold weather has done a number on my lips and regular wasn’t helping. This product is great if you have severe chapped lips. It’s thick and not greasy. I wore it overnight like the box suggested and when I woke up I noticed my lips were soft and the dry skin had come off.,1.0

"This does the trick and does remove most or almost all the makeup. The eye area can be a little tricky, I still prefer eye make up remover to get rid of what was not removed with this balm.The downside is that this formula is just so drying. I’ve used it on trips due to the convenice of not having to worry about liquids in my carry on, but when you remove it, the next day my skin felt so flaky and dry.

After the first few uses my skin did break out. Not sure if it was from the products or my skin was just having one of my occasional break outs. But I wanted to to keep using all the products (I also tested out the serum & mask from this line) so could have a honest review. After a couple of days my skin cleared up. The moisturizer worked well with my primer and makeup. One of my friends were over and tried it and also loved this. I like the smell, it’s a light rose scent. It’s also not thick, kind of a gel like texture.",1.0
I don’t hate the moisturizer but I definitely don’t like it. The scent is SO strong. I am allergic to most fragrances and my skin definitely did not like this on my face. I’m not sure why they would put so much perfume in a face product.. I probably won’t use again because I’m scared my face might break out. If you are okay with fragrances then you’ll like this product!,0.0

I have tried a lot of different products and treatments to try to reduce my scarring and very little has worked, the only other product that comes close is Maracuja Oil. It is heavier so I use a very small amount on my problem areas at night, and so far I’ve seen a noticeable difference in my redness and scarring.",1.0
"I have oily skin with occasional acne. I also own some Tatcha products that I swear by. Unfortunately, this didn’t become one of those. This isn’t (inherently) a “bad“ product. This is a cream-gel that has a bit of fibers mixed in that gives a gentle exfoliation. But, for oily skin, I would prefer a charcoal based cleanser, such as the GLAMGLOW SUPERCLEANSE, which completely strips all sebum and mattifies the face, leaving it feeling squeaky. This is more of an oil balancer, that does decrease some oil on your face, but still leaves a little bit. I suppose that is fine for people who still want a slight glow, but I still don’t think it was deep cleansing enough. The first steps of my routine for my acne prone skin is the GLAMGLOW SUPERCLEANSE then I use the Tatcha “The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder“ in the green Deep formulation. I left a 5 STAR review (with a picture) of it on 20 Aug 2020. That is one of the Tatcha products that I swear by and that I will continue to repurchase.

This was my least favorite product I tested from the set. Mainly because it was too much for my face. It had cool packaging and a great smell but even in small amounts left my skin very oily and oversaturated. I have some deep pores and acne and it did nothing for my skin type. My teen daughter LOVED it! Overall with a dry skin type or used with a more harsh refinisher it may be a better fit.,0.0

It’s okay at best. It’s super watery and I feel like it doesn’t do much to benefit my skins texture or complexion at all. It’s essentially just expensive sticky water.

Defeats the purpose of using it as a moisturizer. So I need to use much more, which obviously isn’t economical as this cream is crazy expensive, I flew through it so quickly. It also has gold in it which (contrary to popular belief) has no effect on the skin other than possibly irritating it, which is exactly what it did to me. After I put this on, my skin would get quite red and irritated for a while, and I got a couple of breakouts on my forehead from this over the course of using it, which never happens to me. Overall, I didn’t hate it enough to not finish it, but I’d definitely never buy it again or recommend anyone else do so either.",0.0
"Not for me! I was really excited to try this moisturizer, but my skin HATED it. I didn’t mind the texture- it’s pretty fluffy- but wasn’t a fan of the scent, or how it made my skin feel oily. Sure enough, I ended up with a huge breakout, and considering I haven’t had any breakouts since last summer(it’s now end of January), I will not be purchasing this.",0.0
"I’m a very fair Scandinavian who wears broad-spectrum spf50 all year round. This means that I’m dreadfully white, especially on my neck. I actually think I look a bit better with a subtle tan which was why I bought this on the recommendation of a Sephora employee I trust. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and add only 1 drop to my night-time face, neck, and arm moisturizer every other day. Thus far I’m very pleased with the result. It doesn’t stain fabric (not sheets nor the white clothes I wear often, nor my white towels) and has given me a subtle, diffuse bronze type effect that also took care of the color disparity between my neck and face (my neck is otherwise much whiter than my face, due of course to the fact that it gets far less sun exposure). The color seems very natural and lasts through my exfoliation/peels, at least with the every-other-night application schedule. I would recommend this to other friends with similar coloring.",1.0
I like this product but it isn’t worth the price tag IMO. It works well for dry skin and doesn’t feel heavy. I also like that it doesn’t have a noticeable scent like other YTTP products. Overall I feel like my CeraVe moisturizer does an equal (if not better) job for a third of the cost.,0.0
Just perfect! I don’t need to try anything else as this is the best cream I have ever tried!,1.0
"I had to buy this because I already love the watermelon glow sleeping mask. I loved it even more!!! This does exactly what it says, leaves my skin plump, hydrated, and glowing! I have dry skin, so I definitely recommend if you do too, putting a thicker moisturizer overtop of this. But even if it’s just left alone, it does the trick for sure! Not to mention, it smells like heaven!!",1.0
I received this product for testing purposes. I have used it twice so far. I love that it has a light beautiful citrus scent! The exfoliant is really nice and felt good massaging it into my skin. The jar in particular is a heavy plastic and feels expensive. I am going to keep using this product as I feel it is a nice addition to my skincare routine!,1.0
"The best way to say it is that I have repurchased this ever since I started using around 2 years ago. I went through multiples of this cream. I use twice a day and it keeps my skin in a normal level and keeps dry spots away in the summer alone. In the winter I need to add oils serums at night or use a heavier cream. I feel this tightens my pores, doesn’t break me out and is amazing base under makeup although I still like to used primer since I love combining products together. It keeps my skin from getting tight at the end or the day or too oily so it is simply perfect for my skin!",1.0

"This stuff is great! It feels amazing and works. I live in a very dry area so I’m always looking for the most moisturizing things and this is one of them. I feel like people complain about the smell, or should I say lack of fragrance but I think most people don’t understand that you do not want to put any scented product on your face! I think the natural smell is great!",1.0
I received a sample of this cream and I love how creamy it is. I feel like it leaves my skin hydrated. I will keep using to see if there are any more improvements to fine lines.,1.0
I love this product so much! I had a sample and HAD to buy the full size! It really does not feel like sub screen at all! It feels great on the skin and it gives me a matte/ natural look that sets a good base for my skin,1.0

Every product from this brand is amazing! What I like about this product is it makes your skin feel soft. It doesn’t feel oily and it’s perfect for almost every skin type.,1.0
"First of all, I want to start off by saying that I enjoyed the formula of this cream, the consistency is perfect, I love that it felt like it was on my skin, even hours later, I’ve used this for about a week now and my skin has not reacted badly, I enjoy using it every morning but I don’t see any difference. It might be that I have to use it more than a week but I don’t have a fulls months worth of product to try it out and give my full opinion on it, based on what I’ve tried I like it",1.0
"I like that it isn’t heavily scented or thick. It is very lightweight and goes on smoothly, however my face feels a bit sticky after applying.  I live in a humid area, so that is definitely something to consider. The cream wasn’t oily at all, but I definitely felt like I needed to wash my hands after applying to my face. I don’t generally have that issue with my main moisturizers/creams/serums. I do take issue that the product has no SPF in it, meaning I have to wear sunscreen on top of it. I also poked around and saw that the company is not cruelty-free, so I’m inclined not to support by buying product. I don’t notice any difference with this face cream from my current skincare products. I won’t be switching to this, but it was nice to try something new. (I received this product for FREE in exchange for reviews)",0.0
"I read the reviews here and wonder if some are DE haters just hating. This cleansing balm does what it says it will do: melt makeup. And it does a really good job of it. I have combo skin, but have been using the DE routine for a couple of months now, so my skin is actually more like normal at this point. I have used cleansing oil before (Josie Maran) but never a balm. The biggest issue I’ve had with this is figuring out how much to apply. I used way too much the first time I tried it, and too little the next time. I’ve got my “Goldilocks“ amount now and I’m very happy with it. I don’t wear a lot of makeup so I mostly wanted to use this to really melt away sunblock and pollution from the day. I love that it does not leave my skin feeling tight in any way after I rise it away. I can opt to skip additional moisturizer and just apply my retinol or glycolic after using it. With the DE Beste jelly, I always need to moisturize right after I cleanse. I really think I will appreciate this even more next winter and maybe use it less frequently as the weather gets more humid, but either way it’s a great tool to have in the toolbox depending on what my skin needs.",1.0
"Got this as a sample, and it broke me out on my checks and my chin area. Once I stopped using it my face started to clear up almost immediately. Maybe works for others but definitely not for my sensitive skin type.",0.0
"After taking the plunge a few years ago, I never looked back. This is in my everyday, twice a day routine. My skin feels and looks great. It evens out tone and prevents breakouts. Highly recommended.",1.0
I’ve been trying this for 2 weeks now and I’ve been having mixed feelings about it. My skin has cleared up quite a bit but my skin has been insanely dry feeling ever since. I’m not sure if it’s suppose to do that but I hate how dry my skin looks and feels. It feels amazing when applying the product and skin feels soft immediately after.,0.0

"This product didn’t do anything the first few weeks. Then after about the 3rd week of using it, my lips had some sort of a reaction to it and became extremely dry.

I was really looking forward to using this and am disappointed that it didn’t work as great as the majority of reviews stated.",0.0

"I do not recommend for anyone who intends to use this sunscreen without a foundation on top. I bought for daily use, and do not wear foundation on a daily basis. This product has a serious shimmer that looks too intense without anything on top to tone it down. I was expecting the glow to come from a dewy finish, but rather the product is so shimmery it’s basically unusable for daily use. Leaving 2 starts because I do see the potential for using the product as a base layer to provide glow to a full face of makeup.",0.0
"These are AMAZING!! Anytime I had a little blemish starting, I pop one of these bad boys on overnight and it is a lot less in the AM.

My pimples are relatively small, so I actually cut these in half to make them last longer.",1.0
"I’m a Sephora Community Ambassador and received this product as a part of the National Lipstick Day gratis in exchange for my honest opinion. While I was initially surprised at how small it was, I have to say it’s lasted me quite a bit! The smallest amount goes a long way to keep your lips feeling hydrated. I wish there was a way to keep the applicator within the product so as not to lose it, but it’s a beautiful set.",1.0
"I bought this thinking that it would be great for the days I don’t want to wear makeup, but this ended up to be a total disappointment. This product is pore clogging, I always breakout at the end of the day when I use it. The texture is very heavy, and it just sits on the skin. On top of that, it didn’t do a great job in covering the redness either.",0.0
worth the buy! very hydrating and great texture! I have very dry skin and it didn’t make it more dry,1.0
I got a sample of this for by birthday from sephora and i was so excited to use it. i put it on washed my face with it then washed it off with water. then i went to continue on with my skincare routine. as soon as i put one of my serums on i realized that all the prouduct hadn’t come off. so i washed off the serum and tried to wash the rest of the cleanser off. once again the water got clear and stopped making foam so i assumed i got it off again. tried my cleanser again but again got foam and bubbles. i’ve tried it time and time again and still can’t get all the product off. i’ve officially given up. i do not recommend,0.0

"I’m a big fan of Dr. Jart’s Tiger Grass Cream because it always seems to help my skin out when it’s feeling angry, so I was happy to use 100 reward points on this. Unfortunately, I don’t think it really does much to correct redness in any meaningful way, even when I use more than the suggested “moderate“ amount. I also found that the green color didn’t transition to beige entirely successfully and I wound up having to add some concealer or light foundation on top to correct the color correction (and any lingering redness that didn’t get much help from the product).",0.0
"amazing!!!!!! I recently have suffered from eczema on my face (I’ve never had eczema before and truly didn’t know what was happening) and this helped so much.

"Jurlique rose water balancing mist is one of my fav, since my skin seems like rose, I figured I can give this a try. Drier part of my skin is very sensitive, some toner can make it feels very tight, red and itchy. This dosen’t do that at all, which is good. It is what it said, very hydrating, feels like a very-- very-- watery serum. It leaves my skin extra soft. Seems it balance my skin a little, but I’m not sure. It smells exactly like rose to me, smells like real rose being processed into the product, doesn’t smell like a adding frequent. Although it doesn’t smell as good as jurlique rosewater, my sensitive skin reacts nice to it and I like the scent.",1.0

I was excited to try this serum.  While I did enjoy it a lot the effects were great. My skin looks and feels amazing. It does however take awhile to absorb into the skin. Not a dealbreaker I just adjusted my routine to account for that,1.0
Lovely mild slightly citrusy scent. It’s not too thick and has a light tingle after applying but it’s very pleasant which makes me think it’s working. I received a trial size but I think it has brightened my skin a little.,1.0

So I was kinda iffy on purchasing this one but I am glad that I did. I love the feeling and texture so far. I am not a fan of sticky liquids and I find they do not allow my moisturizer to glide/absorb into my skin well however this is more on the watery side which I am usually a fan of. With the VIB sale going on I am glad I picked up another one. Might consider grabbing a few more.,1.0
Loved this product. I have sensitive skin and had no issues with this product. Would recommend.,1.0
"I have constantly dry lips so I decided to try this lip balm because I already use the LaNeige Lip Sleeping Mask ( which I really enjoy using at night ).

Love it, I even have a backup!",1.0
I received this product free for testing. I don’t mind the product for a moisturizer but I have yet to notice a difference in wrinkles or lines. It did cause a few bumps on my skin at first as well but that could just be my sensitive skin. The bumps went away and my face got used to the product. I am still giving it a 4 star because it’s a good product as long as you don’t expect it to work miracles on your face.,0.0
"I’ve been using this product for about three years now. While I was impressed with its effectiveness in the beginning, especially as far as eliminating existing acne/breakouts, over time I’ve become disappointed in its ability to prevent new breakouts altogether. I keep my face clean, drink plenty of water, etc. in addition to religiously using this wash daily, but looking at my face at this moment you wouldn’t think I used an acne control cleanser. It’s definitely not as drying or irritating as other washes I’ve tried in the past which is a big reason I liked it (I have sensitive/combo skin). That’s why it’s such a bummer to realize that I will have to once again search for a new, more effective cleanser.",0.0

I will stick with my Biossance omega cream that smells bad but doesn’t clog my pores.  I have to say I did react the same with the Drunk Elephant peptide cream last year. I will stay away from these types of cream. I’m glad I got a big sample and not a regular size.",0.0

I’m sorry but this does absolutely nothing but apply a layer of grease and shift around some makeup. I wanted to love this.

I love this cleansing balm. I’ve used so many cleansing balms and this is the one that checks everything off my list. It wipes away every trace of makeup. It smells so fresh and natural. It doesn’t irritate my eczema patches. It calms the skin. It cleans the skin so well. I know some people like to wash again after using the balm and that’s fine!

I’m absolutely in awe of this moisturizer. I have previously used face scrubs and face wash from Ole Henriksen but this was my first time trying their face creme. Firstly I want to mention that I received this complimentary for sampling but I used it for week to allow me to put forward an honest feedback. My first impression of the product was I just love how it smells! The light yet sweet citrusy smell just awakens me and feels like a treat during application. The texture of this feels whipped rather then gel and a little sure goes a long way. I avoided using my regular serums/oils in conjunction to it and honestly this is amazingly hydrating by itself. I even went to bed couple of nights without re-applying because that’s how hydrated my skin felt. I noticed my face looked more radiant and plump but there was no drastic brightening effect. Also one week maybe too less to get that kind of an effect. One thing I would have appreciated more is if it soaked into my skin faster. It takes about 15 minutes for the creaminess to go so I kind of avoid wearing it before makeup if I’m in a rush. I did not take a star out for this because I use my regular moisturizer underneath makeup and I enjoy the C-rush nonetheless.,1.0
"Hard pass for me. For this price point, I expected so much more from this product. It is slimy, greasy, and impossible to wash off your skin. It left a filmy coating on my loofah, and I had to use 2-3 rounds of body wash just to cut through the grease. Ugh. The product was all separated when I first went to use it and took a LOT of shaking just to become usable - not a great start. I’d rather use banana boat or Hawaiian tropic. Honestly the only positive thing I can say about this product is that I didn’t get a suburn.",0.0
I loved the idea of this high end product but in the end stopped using it. I noticed that I started to develop static acne...the painful deep acne. I used this product for a month. I never had this problem before. As soon as I stopped using it the acne went away. Might affect someone else differently but for me it was a huge waste of $100.,0.0
Summer Fridays gifted me this Jet Lag Mask. I really love how it’s kept my skin hydrated throughout the night and into the morning. Definitely getting that glow skin vibes using this and I love it! Would definitely buy again!,1.0
"This sunscreen works as any sunscreen should- it protected my tattoo and my face, the main places I put sunscreen on. The problem with it came with applying it to my colored tattoo, where I could see it start flaking when directly applied to my tattoo. It wasn’t a great look! I did however, like it better on my face and liked how there isn’t any apparent sunscreen ’smell’ to it.",1.0
This stuff does nothing to my skin. Used it for a month and saw no type of result at all.,0.0
I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few weeks and I love it! It has a pleasant smell and is very thick. I learned a little goes a long way. Does not sit on my skin and feels like it really soaks in.,1.0
"Love this gentle cleanser, light scent & makes my skin feel so soft and supple. Would definitely repurchase",1.0
"I really had hope for this product.  I did not find much value here.  The 3 prong approach that this product states is hydrating to plump fine dry lines, Resurface to minimize the look for wrinkles and to support the natural collagen.  After several weeks of use I am not sure I see a difference.  I want to believe this works though since it’s Clinique.  I did let a friend try it who does not have an extensive skin care regimen and she thinks she got some results.  Would I recommend, probably not but it did work for my friend so it’s worth testing for your self.",0.0
"This product was sent to me in an Influencer VoxBox, and I was excited to try it. I’ve been using it for about two weeks. It’s an ok moisturizer. It isn’t greasy, but it also isn’t especially hydrating. I feel like it was clarifying for the pores on my forehead and checks, but not so much on my nose. The smell is a little funky, but not terribly overbearing.",1.0
"I do like this product, however the price for the size of the bottle is a little ridiculous.",0.0
"Let me tell you how I use this mask... I apply the mask after my nighttime routine, right before bed. Be fairly generous. Then just go to sleep and when you wake up, wipe it off before you brush your teeth and shower. The key here is the shower... if you like hot or warm showers just do you thing and then you’re ready take your fingers and gently rub your lips. All that dry, cracked or peely skin from the night before will come right off. This mask preps the lips for an easy removal of any gross skin on your lips. At first I didn’t think it did anything, but then I figured out how to use it. While I can’t say it does anything for my lips moisture wise (hence 4 stars), it’s great for treating my dry peeling lips.",1.0
"I love this brand, and this product so much this is my third or fourth bottle of this mask and it is perfect for summertime masking. It helps hydrate my skin without making it irritated or breaking it out. Gifted by summer Fridays",1.0
I received this product free from Influenster for reviewing purposes and so far I love it. I have dry skin but I don’t like anything to heavy in the daytime under makeup so I’m usually really picky but this stuff works great. It’s lightweight with a wonderful smell. It helps keep me hydrated throughout the day. I don’t think I’ve used a bad product from OleHenriksen. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any of their products and this is no exception.,1.0
"I was pleasantly surprised with this face wash. It was very gentle and smells like a cup of mint tea. As the name indicates, it works up a nice soft lather. I am acne prone and it didn’t make me break out and it didn’t feel like my face was stripped of oils either.",1.0
"I really wanted to like this product since I spent so much money on it. But I switched from the fresh rose moisturizer, which I like infinitely better. The dewy skin cream is only ok. It makes my skin super soft, but it also makes it burn a little. It also takes forever to absorb and can leave my skin greasy. I’m hoping it works better for my winter skin.",0.0
It’s a really nice moisturizer. It’s not too heavy but you definitely feel like something is there. Doesn’t leave a weird feeling/film. I wake up and my skin looks exactly how I left it. I used only at night for a while because I got a very small container. Thinking of restocking with the bigger size so I can use morning and night.,1.0
"I was actually wanting to get the oil and water cleaner because I have dry skin, not really acne prone skin. But this was a pleasant surprise. It’s gel consistency removes my make up and leaves my skin smooth not dry. It’s fragrance free and comes in a good size bottle. I would keep using it in my nightly routine. I just don’t like the amount that comes out no matter how lightly I squeeze. You only really need a dime size but a quarter square skin comes out.",1.0
I used a sample and it made my skin burn so bad...,0.0
"i bought berry, pear and peach because i love the lip sleeping mask so much and i am so glad i got 3 of these. they feel so nice on my lips and leave my lips feeling moisturized more than most balms i have used. the scents are amazing and i like the packaging too. i didnt get grapefruit because i dont like that scent otherwise i would have all 4 of these. you cant go wrong with any of them and they are a must have for your purse, next to your bed and anywhere else. seriously my new fave.",1.0
I like how my skin feels after it clears but every time I use it it breaks me out like crazy. Not even when I was a teen I would break out that much. After it goes away my skin looks awesome but OMG not worth it.,0.0
"The oil’s vitamin A and linoleic acids regulate sebum production, which prevents blackheads and whiteheads from forming. Rose Seed Oil really works. I put it on whenever I can hours after my usual skincare regimen, so they don’t mix.I put it on the sides of my eyes on the crow’s feet. I use it to prevent acne and to help with fine lines.  So far, so good!The cost, well, you can’t beat it!",1.0
I got the small size of this as part of my birthday gift. It’s definitely not moisturizing...I mean it’s winter now so I don’t expect it to be my go to for hydration but it’s a little annoying to have to go over my face with another moisturizer every morning and night. Skin feels a little firmer but doubt I’d purchase this since it’s expensive for the amount of product.,0.0
"you can feel the granules of oats in this. kind of a dealbreaker for me, it just doesn’t feel nice to use/put on your skin. It also separates quickly (imagine ketchup bottle without shaking it). but since this is thick balm in a tube you canf shake the separation out.",0.0

"I’m 24 with combo skin but I never had an issue with acne until about age 19. I’ve tried EVERYTHING and I mean everything and no product cleared up blemishes faster than this. This product doesn’t do what many spot treatments do by making blemishes worse before they get better. I often sleep with a bit on an affected area and in the morning it’ll be gone. You only need a little, too. Trust me, this is beyond worth the splurge!!!!",1.0

"The Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream is a 24-hour, daily lightweight hydrating cream.  It claims it is a fast-absorbing cream that provides water replenishment throughout the day by absorbing moisture from the air for continuous comfort and moisture-balanced skin.  It contains Squalane and Antarcticine, which are highly effective at moisturizing the skin.  I was excited to try out this rpdouct because it is a known, popular product from the Kiehl’s brand.  I also have very normal-to-dry skin.  So anything that is highly effective at moisturizing the skin, I am excited to test out.  I have been using this product everyday since receiving, and I can tell a difference in the moisturize levels of my skin.  My skins is moisturized and looks radiant/glowy.  I use this product immediately after washing my face to lock in the moisture.   I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends",1.0

"I am someone with very sensitized skin & I avoid fragrance & alcohol ingredients at all costs & use products with not too many ingredients or powerful chemicals. I needed something to exfoliate my face only every once in a while. I used this one time- it did exactly what I needed & I really enjoyed the experience, but my face was SO stripped immediately after I used it :( Sadly, I had to return. If my face wasn’t so stripped afterwards, this would of been my new go to exfoliator.",0.0
"This product has changed my skin game!! I have oily skin and have a lot of mini blackheads in my nose and chin area. This product clears up my skin and keeps disasters at bay. Whenever I pop my pimples and mask, I always apply this after and feel like it really gets deep in my pores and unclogs them and removed toxins. It reduces pimple sizes and keeps my skin clear. The color completely dissolves into the skin and the scent doesn’t bother me too much. This is my first product from Sunday Riley and I will repurchase!! My next item will be the Luna Oil!!",1.0
wanted to love this product. the first few days I used it I really liked how smooth my skin felt! after the first few uses though I broke out in little pimples all over :( it took me back to the days of apricot scrub. sadly this had to be thrown out,0.0
Overall very happy with this oil! I heard someone say that to prevent aging it’s good to apply oil as much as possible so I’ve been on the hunt for a good one. I tried a bunch of travel sizes of various oils and settled on buying the full size of this one. I am 32 and have dry/combo skin. It’s been working well and hasn’t broken me out. I use Tretinoin cream a few nights a week so it’s helped prevent drying/peeling. I gave 4 stars because it is expensive! I’d recommend trying it in one of the mini sizes if you are on the fence the tiny bottle lasted me about 3 months so I’m pretty sure the big one will last at least a year and I’m applying it up to 3-4 times a day!,1.0
"The best, freshest toner I have ever used!  Other toners feel like alcohol on the skin. This is light, and makes my skin feel absolutely alive!  No strong smell, and not thick. I am late 30s with mixed skin, sun sensitive, and acne prone. This helps keep the acne down.",1.0

"One of the only times I really disliked a product.  This stick is full of moisture, the problem is that it sits on the skin and it doesn’t feel like it is able to get in to nourish the skin.  Also, it prevented my skin from breathing and caused me to break out.  An unfortunate purchase for sure.",0.0
Smells nice but it makes my pores stiff and large. Seems to be causing some sort of scarring or reaction on my face. Moisture is too superficial.,0.0

"I received this for free for testing purposes. This has definitely done wonders for my skin. Especially since I’m on retinol now I definitely needed a hydrating moisturizer to protect my skin barrier.

"When I first received Goops Overnight Glow peep I thought it was a full face mask so it was refreshing to know it was a circle pad soaked in product. It was very easy to apply. It did have a little burn but to me, it meant it was working. When I woke up the next morning I noticed my face did have a glow and it was also very soft. I think this is a product you have to continue on using to see full results. I believe I will purchase this product because I really liked how it made my skin feel the next morning. Also, it’s important to wear sunblock the next morning so your face won’t get burned.",1.0

Thanks to Topbox Circle I received a free Clinique sample of the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting  Eye Cream. Unfortunately the sample is so tiny that I find impossible to rate properly this eye cream except for the fell and texture of it.  What I liked is that the cream is not too thick. It feels nice and is hydrating. But with only a few days of use no noticeable result was observed.  #freeproduct  #trywithtopbox,1.0

Started using again just to be sure and the pimples came back.  Guess my skin is just too sensitive for oil based products like this.",0.0
I wanted to like this cleanser based on reviews and it’s ingredient content. However after a couple months of use I didn’t really see it doing much. It almost feels like putting on really mild soap. I know that a cleanser is just to help cleanse your face but I often felt it leaving my skin drier after using it :( it does have a mild scent to it (hence the name) but nothing too nasty or overbearing.,0.0
"This is the perfect consistency: not too heavy, not too light, absorbs quickly so can be used at night or during the day under makeup. Feels nice and cool on application and helps my eye area look brighter and more hydrated basically right away. Wish it was in a tube but no real complaints.",1.0
I love my skincare regimen to the point that it almost feels like a daily spa day! I was so excited to try this but after only one use I will be discontinuing this product. The scent is just way too offensive and I can’t get beyond it. It’s unfortunate because I really wanted to like this.,0.0

First time I used it I thought the texture and consistency would be awful but I couldn’t have been more wrong. It gets all the makeup gone, on the first try, and it does it without irritating my skin or leaving any kind of residue. Plus, it smells good and doesn’t burn if you accidentally get some in your eye.",1.0

I agree with one of the recent reviews I bought this at a pretty high price point. The bottle is way too small and I felt I needed to wash my face a few times to really feel my makeup come off. I resorted to getting a makeup remover to make sure after I use this my face has no foundation residue. I’m probably considering to return this considering how much it has for the 5.1 oz,0.0

"I received this product complimentary from  Innisfree. I love this brand because of the good quality of their products and how affordable they are. This sunscreen is supposed to be lightweight, with aloe vera to hydrate the skin, centella asiatica (cica) to avoid skin irritation, and sunflower oil to moisturize, so every skin type could use it.  The scent of it it’s subtle wich I didn’t mind, I applied a small amount like advised and spread it on my face. The consistency it’s a little heavy, leaving a dewy finish. No white cast because it’s a chemical sunscreen. I had to set my face with setting powder to mattify my skin. I am acne prone and most sunscreens break my face, but with this one so far I haven’t had any new blemishes. I would recommend this to everyone who’s looking for an everyday sun protector wich can be used under makeup but for oily skin people I advise to prepare and set the skin after.",1.0
"This is the most potent retinol I’ve ever tried (I switch off days with The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2%) and no signs of irritation, no breakouts - nothing. Ive only been using it a couple weeks so I can’t say about longer term effects but my fine lines & wrinkles are definitely not worse, maybe even a little less noticeable! So, so far so good. High price point is the only drawback but if you dont have sensitive skin I’d recommend it. Unlike some DE products it seems like it should last a decent amount of time too!",1.0
"I have been using it for about a week now. My lips are just as dry if not worse. I’m not surprised though, I use there eye sleeping mask and have been for 2 months now, ZERO difference. Don’t waste your money I don’t understand why believe there products are so special",0.0
"I usually love Origins products but this scrub disappointed. It does a poor exfoliation job and does not leave the skin refreshed. Its a heavy citrus scent and is comparable to drug store face washes. I would say this is a pricier version of the Clean and Clear Morning Burst facewash. If that is something you are looking for, then I’d suggest to go with the Clean and Clear.",0.0
I got this with my points but oh my gosh is it the best thing I’ve received in the mail recently. It really is the best and easiest makeup remover in my arsenal and it has really has encouraged me to wear more makeup even during the pandemic because I don’t dread taking my makeup off anymore. Taking off my makeup used to be a multi-step process but now I just use this product. It melts off even my waterproof eyeliner and mascara although you need be a little bit more liberal with the product for mascara. Highly considering getting more.,1.0

But I hate that funky layer of gunk feeling most lotions leave you with. it’s Confidence in a Cream does not! Glides on smooth and really gives my makeup a great foundation to build on.

But definitely healthier and happier!",1.0
"Love the product itself but the pump sucks it up when not in use and just slowly leaks it out of the pump spout. Unfortunately I didn’t realize that is what was happening until it was too late to return to Sephora and contacting Youth to the People has gotten me nowhere, such a shame because this is NOT a cheap cleanser yet so much of it is being completely wasted by poor packaging. I guess you could transfer is to a new bottle but you shouldn’t have to do that when you are paying 40 bucks for a face wash. At least one other person has commented about this and there is a reddit thread from like a year ago where people are having this issue, so it’s a long term issue YTTP aren’t solving.",0.0

"I was SO excited to try this but it was definitely a swing and a miss. Unlike other reviewers, I did really enjoy the smell—it’s almost medicinal and for whatever reason that soothes me. I have light, cool toned skin with a lot of redness. Was really hoping this would help even out my skin tone but all it did was leave a super ashy almost ghostly veil on my skin. I tried patting it in with my fingers, rubbing it on like lotion, using a beauty blender, even a brush but it just doesn’t work for me. It also feels SO cakey and tacky on my skin—it never seems to completely dry for me—and both my full coverage foundation and light coverage foundations did not look good over top. I really tried to give it a chance because there were so many positive reviews but this is a no for me. I’m really glad I got the mini before going for the full size and recommend others do the same.",0.0

This is a no for me personally. This product may be for someone who’s a beginner. But if you want some legit skin care check out ole henrickson or Tula. This stuff is so sticky and the scent is over powering. Did nothing for my skin and seems a little gimmicky.,0.0
"I have used this product for several months now. I love it and highly recommend it to others. I don’t however, recommend the refill. I was excited to have less plastic waste but the refill cartridge does not fit in the original case such that the pump is capable of functioning nor the upper screw on component capable of sitting over the new cartridge. I have wasted a lot of product to try and get the refill to fit and that is pretty disappointing given the cost. At this point I’m going to literally scoop the components of the new cartridge into the old so that I don’t waste what’s left. Great idea in theory but poor execution.",0.0
Was not as amazing as I thought. It took a bit to completely turn color and fade. I had to apply something on top whereas I thought I could put it on to mask flaws and go about my day. But you will need to apply a touch of makeup to make it blend and not draw attention to the imperfections it is supposed to mask.,1.0
"Had to try since everyone is going gaga for it on social media. It instantly irritated my skin and I saw no difference, no tint, no help with my discoloration. Two thumbs down.",0.0
"Finally - a face cream that doesn’t make react to my sensitive eyes and feels wonderful. For years I’ve struggled to find a face cream that doesn’t make my eyes burn all day - they are so sensitive it’s ridiculous. I’m clearly very sensitive to something commonly used in skin care products that are not clean and green.  My skin feels hydrated, happy and I have a healthy glow! At first I was putting too much on and it was pilling, so I lightened up on the amount and it’s perfect now. I’m in love with this company!",1.0
"I received the mini to test the product, and although i received this, these are my own opinion on testing the product.The consistency of the product, I like quite a bit, but the smell of it reminds me of a mosquito/bug candle. It does feel moisturizing, but once the product settles/ absorbs into the skin, my skin feels and looks the same as if I didn’t put anything on, but on some days, my skin looks and feel more hydrated. I’ve tried this over a few days, hit or miss on my skin. Maybe it’ll work better for others? I do have normal skin.",0.0
"I bought this product in the spring around March. It’s almost October and I’m not at the halfway mark in the bottle yet. its super moisturizing and I bought it to not only test it out, but I wanted a moisturizer that’s long lasting. It makes your skin feel soft. Use a good facial oil underneath for a dewy look all day round. It’s pretty lightweight and very creamy. Be careful with how you pour it into your hands!! About 5 to 7 drops should be enough for anyone’s face (go off if you want to add more, who cares, just not all at once). It can drip down your arm or onto the floor/ counter. Make sure to check the rim of the bottle because theres usually a lot of product there. Although this is a 2 in 1, I still use Toner. I’m hoping this works when it gets colder out but I’m not sure. I don’t think I’ll have any problems though. My other moisturizer is from First Aid Beauty, and putting a little of that on top of this will definitely work. Try this out!",1.0
"I ended up retuning this product, but it just wasn’t for my skin sadly!",0.0
Wow. This product has totally changed my skin. I was suffering from tiny little hard breakouts and cystic acne and they are gone after a week of using this cleanser. I will say that I don’t like the packaging and wish it was a pump or at least that the cap was attached. It’s just clumsy. However it’s totally worth it because it is life changing.,1.0
This irritated my eyes so bad. I actually had to go to the eye doctor and had multiple scratches on my eye. I would give zero stars if I could.,0.0
Made my skin super sticky. But smelled nice. Loved the packaging.,0.0
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. I have dry and sensitive, acne prone skin and this does not irritate my skin at all. It’s a thicker consistency, but it feels so lightweight when it’s on. When I wake in the morning my face feels so hydrated and refreshed. Definitely a product that is worth the splurge. Even got my boyfriend addicted to using it. He has combination skin, but more towards the oily side. It is definitely our holy grail product!",1.0

"Complimentary from Glow Recipe. This cream leaves my skin feeling so refreshed, hydrated and smooth I love it! Love that this jar is refillable and it smells amazing too! Isn’t too heavy on my skin and I can see how it brightens my skin and leaves it glowing.",1.0
"I’ve used it for about 8 months now, and I think it does what it claims. I do feel my lips are soft and hydrated the morning after. But I do find that I needed to use it every night for the effects to last. Recently I’m starting to find that my lips are dry even after using this, though. This jar lasts a long time, I still have more than 1/3 left!",1.0
"bought the mini during quarantine because I can’t sample it in store. the hydration and nourishment felt pretty average, however you HAVE to use it as a night cream because the shine it leaves is RIDONKULOUS. my cheek looked like a whole mirror. Like I know it says “dewy skin cream“, but I thought it meant my skin was gonna have that dewy glow of moisture, not vegetable oil on my countertop. You could probably fix it with a bit of translucent powder, but the price point for me isn’t worth it. Great product if you’re into the glass skin look, just def not for me and my baby seal bod <3",0.0

Beautiful packaging and product delivers. I noticed  softer skin after a few days. My pores seemed smaller as well.,1.0
"Yes, this product removes makeup well, but is chock full of sensitizing ingredients (essential oils). I also noticed after using my eyes, which are not typically sensitive, were watering a lot. With so many good cleansing balms that don’t have problematic ingredients, this is a pass for me. For reference, I have combo, acne-prone skin with mild rosacea.",0.0
"Great 2 in 1 product. Goes on light and doesn’t make your skin feel heavy or greasy. I didn’t love the smell, but it wasn’t bad!",1.0
This eye cream is lightweight with a smooth texture. It really did feel and look like it moisturized my under eyes. I noticed my fine line were less noticeable and that my concealer went on nicely. Going to continue to keep using and hopefully I notice even greater benefits!,1.0
"I was definitely surprised that it blurred out my little fine lines.  No bad skin reactions,  not too oily and left my face soft. It does seem to wear off before my day is over. That’s  a little disappointing considering the price.",1.0
I got this in the Sephora Bday gift and I was so excited to try it. After a fee days of using it little bumps appear in my forehead and chin. I stop using it and it went away after a few days. This week I tried it again to make sure it was this product and unfortunately it was. I have the tiny bumps again!!!! Hope my face clears soon,0.0

I received this product for free in return of my honest review. I have to say this isn’t the best lip mask I have ever used. I didn’t tell much of a difference after using for a week straight and nightly.

"It is a gorgeous cleanser, but it gets points off for the packaging and for the grit. I assume the gentle grit is for physical exfoliation, but personally I use enough chemical exfoliates like AHA’s and BHA’s that this doesn’t suit me. I also like a cleanser with no physical exfoliation so I can wash my eye makeup off as part of my second cleanse and this won’t do. The packaging does seem fun and luxurious, but it won’t let you get all the product out and have fun cutting it open because it is thiccc.",0.0
Been using this line for over 8 months and I absolutely love it. My skin has never felt so balanced! :),1.0
I really like the balm as a first step to remove makeup and dirt. It may be a little too greasy for some but it works great for my drier skin. But I would definitely use a double cleanse with this product,1.0
"This serum was truly nothing special. It didn’t  cause any negative harm, however after using it religiously every day I didn’t notice any real difference. The anti-aging properties that the ingredients possess are supposed to emulate botox - they have a freezing effect on your facial muscles that would eventually lead to less wrinkles. I felt this slightly while using the product, but it was nothing life changing. I wouldn’t repurchase this product.",0.0

"I got this as a sample and really liked this we my regular moisturizer. This really is liquid moisturizer, has a thin consistency. Applies nice and absorbs in quickly.

"✨Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Primer✨I literally felt like I was scooping up soft butter, the texture was so creamy and dreamy! It was very rich but not greasy, I have never felt anything like it. It hydrates, softens and smoothes your skin.  It’s is perfect for those with dry/combo skin and makes your makeup look flawless! The formula is created with Hyaluronic Acid, Squalane, and Shea Butter helps instantly hydrate, plump, and prep skin (also has vitamins B, C & E). Lightly scented (scent reminds me of a spa)",1.0
"I was really disappointed in this product. I heard great things about it and the reviews were all positive, but when I finally tried it it didn’t work for me at all. My lips have been dry lately and this product hasn’t helped at all. If anything I feel like my lips are even more dry than they were before I started using it. I definitely wouldn’t waste the money on it!",0.0

"I wish I liked this product more than I did! This product was overall a little ‘blah’ for me. Fortunately it didn’t break me out or cause any serious skin issues for me, which can be an issue as I have very sensitive dry skin. But I don’t think it made a significance either, and for the price tag I would expect my skin to feel radiant and rejuvenated. Overall it wasn’t bad, but I don’t think I would repurchase either.",0.0
"I REALLY wanted to love this product after seeing all of the reviews, but it lived up to be far less than my expectations. I have dry/combination skin, sometimes I am a bit dry in areas and other places are very oily. That being said, this product dried my skin out so much that my face feels like actual sandpaper. I have tried exfoliating but even after a few days my skin has yet to recover. The next problem was the color, I mixed it with my favorite moisturizer (Cera Ve) and I woke up to an incredible blotchy and uneven skin tone that was VERY orange, especially in areas that are more dry (around the nose, cheeks). My skin was not dry before I used this product but it dried my skin out so much and was noticeably more orange in the areas it dried out. While this product may work for some people, I would strongly advise anyone with sensitive/dry skin to STAY AWAY as you will not get promising results.",0.0
"Could work for someone with very little dark circles as a cosmetic temporary measure. However, not helpful in any way for concealing dark circles or puffiness.I got it when it was first available on sephora.com and was using since. Absolutely no improvement. I’d not recommend it. Also none of my regular concealers worked on top of that cream.",0.0
These are great. I usually use nexcare or ones from Korea once I pop pimples but these even work on zits deep under the skin. One night sleeping with one of these dots makes the a painful deep-under-the-skin blemish not hurt and a few nights reduces the size.,1.0

"I bought this because I am looking for a new not expensive cleanser that could work for my boyfriend too. We HATE it. It leaves a weird film on your skin that can only be taken off by a double cleanse with a different cleanser. It smells weird too. I will definitely not repurchase. That being said, it does what it’s supposed to. It takes off my make up well. It feels great while it’s on your skin (before you TRY to rinse it off). It did not break me out (and that happens easily). It could work great for someone who uses it as a first cleanse, but not alone. That’s why I gave it 3 stars.",0.0
"love this moisturizer. It is light weight, not greasy, and actually feels like it is doing its job. I have been buying this for the last 4 years and adore it. Granted I only use this during the winter since I don’t need moisturizer during the summer but if I did this would be enough moisture without weighing you down.",1.0
I had high hopes for this one since Dermalogica has some great products which I’ve tried in the past but this is one I would not recommend for sensitive skin. The abrasion felt too rough for my skin which resulted in redness as well as gave me an itch which is rare for me. I really did not see any amazing results either which would make me want to continue using it.  Daily Microfoliant was gifted by Dermalogica for my honest review.,0.0
"I put this on in the morning as I prep my face and get ready. Makes my lips so soft and smooths over my dry lips. It has a nice subtle peach scent that is very pleasant if you like the smell of peach.  This seems less viscous than the sleep mask, but once it melts in you can get the same results. I like that it’s in a tube vs having to dip my spatula into a pot from a cleanliness perspective. There is no color added with this just a shine. Goes away if you wipe your lips. The softness stays. The best thing is this is not sticky and my long hair doesn’t stick to it.",1.0
"This is a very hydrating toner. It feels soooo nice on my skin, but didn’t do anything for my pores which left me really disappointed. I have oily, acne-prone skin. It might be suitable for dry and sensitive skin.",0.0
oily skin gal here! i’ve been using this mask one to two times a week for over a month now (maybe even two months) and i hate to say it but i found this mask barely did anything to my skin. i find it more refreshing than anything else. i’m still going to use it until i finish the bottle but i will not be repurchasing.,0.0
I was little hesitant to try this brand because I have seen mix reviews previously. But what I can conclude now is that is now going to be part of my new skin routine. I was in shock of how good my skin felt Everytime I follow the Sky-II skin routine process I saw results right away. I felt my skin refresh and brighter and felt my skin really different from other products i have seen in the past. You start to feel that it burn a little at first and saw little redness but it did change my skin by the second time i tried it. It erased my skin dark spots that no other product i have used in the past did. It really change my skin to brighter and my wrinkles are disappearing by everyday use. Thank you so much for Influenster for this wonderfully sample. I will recommend to all my friend and family members and I will buy the full size products now and it will be part of my new skin routine. love the packaging and love how easy is to use.,1.0

"I really wanted to like this product, unfortunately it did pill no matter how I prepped before putting it on, irritating to my eyes, left a slight but noticeable white cast, and left my face dry.

Yes it is very glossy and yes it smells amazing but it completely dried out my lips. The lip mask is 10xs better. With the mask you get glossy plump lips. Had to return it.,0.0
I received this product as a free sample. So I had not heard of this brand prior to receiving the items but when I looked around I heard great things about the product line. The balm is honestly okay it’s not revolutionary as I had thought it will be. It’s a simple balm and the ones that are medicated off the shelf do better in my opinion during winters than this but it’s good to use as a base underneath liquid lipsticks.,1.0
"This product is unique! I have never used a powder exfoliator & it worked well on my sensitive skin. I’m so glad it did not strip my skin dry & can be used daily! I wanted to love this item with 5 stars but I have one con: It’s sloppy and can be a bit messy rubbing it onto your face. The texture feels weird but other than that it does it’s job. My face felt fresh, softer and smoother just after first time use.",1.0
My lips are always dry and I’ve tried so many products.  This is the absolute best!  It’s so moisturizing and has staying power without being sticky.  It feels luxe and creamy.  I got a sample as part of my birthday gift and will be purchasing the full size.,1.0

Not worth the cost. I got this essence because I heard great reviews on how hyrdrating it is but let me tell you it’s overpriced water. Nothing special. I have been using this for 2 weeks and I no longer will be using it because the cosrx essence is 10x more hydrating for a fraction of the price. This was so dissapointing.,0.0
"This is an alright cleanser, especially for acne prone or oily skin. It was very cleansing and my skin felt good after using it. However the smell of the product really bothered me.

Please keep in mind this is so tiny! This is more like a sample size. You can only get one or 2 miles out of this little tube. One star for that reason alone. As far as results I do like this mask but I was genuinely disappointed a company would sell this one else for eight dollars.,0.0
"I love this product, first time buying it. For the 15ml if you use it properly as they say it will last about three months of using it every night which I do. My skin glows what more can I say, if you can afford this or you’re willing to spend the money then you should.",1.0
"I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few months now. It feels fine, goes on smooth, and absorbs nicely, and that’s about it. I see no reduction in any fine lines or wrinkles, no true changes in my skin in any way. While that is fine, this product is quite expensive, for the price, I would honestly expect it to do a little more than a product that I can pick up at target for a fraction of the price. Also, this packaging is absolutely horrible. I know I’m going to be getting low soon and you bet your butt I’m breaking this thing open to see what’s inside. The packaging is honestly overkill wasteful, and the fact it can’t be opened is an insult considering how much this costs. Maybe it’s made for people who just like expensive products that look nice. Anyways, like I said, it’s a fine moisturizer, but that’s all it is. It’s nothing special, and you can find better options at lower prices.",0.0
"Wanted to love this product after seeing all of the other positive reviews but it has broken me out after 2-3 days of use every time I try to use it. The texture is nice and light on the skin, there is no particular scent, and it is relatively moisturizing, but my skin does not like it. Just for the sake of comparison for others, I have oily skin but don’t usually experience break outs. Rating three stars for formula.",0.0
"This product has CHANGED THE GAME for me. I am new to the skincare game as of the last year and I have always had oily but very dry and flaky skin! It was awful and no amount of scrubbing with face scrubs or wash cloths was helping anything.

This has improved my skin more than I could’ve ever imagined! 11/10!",1.0
"Really love this product. It has a buttery and light texture, and feels rich.I have oily skin so for the first few days of testing this product, I used it every night with the liquid collagen, and in the morning I would apply my regular moisturizer and did notice that my face felt extremely moisturized, but oily throughout the day. So I will scale back and use this every other night just to keep my face from becoming too oily. My skin did feel refreshed and very hydrated, and a little goes a long way for me.Perfect for my dry skin ladies! I did received this product complimentary, but my opinions are my own.",1.0
"I recieved this product to review from Influenster. Through reading all of the reviews and clinical trials on this product I was sure it was going to be amazing. However, for the price that they offer it at the package seems cheap and it’s an odd texture. It looks exactly like water but when you put it on your face it’s sticky at first then helps your face get mousturized. I personally enjoy my drugstore moisturizer better than the essence because it seems like it is actually doing work, verses feeling like this product should be doing work.",0.0
"Ok moisturizer, but not very hydrating. I found it as a great day moisturizer that my sensitive skin didn’t react to. But I actually didn’t find it very hydrating so I’d have to reapply a few times through the day especially during the Winter.",0.0
I would say this is more of a primer than an eye cream. The overall texture is nice and is OK under makeup (makeup ends up creasing over time) but it did not have any benefits - felt like my wrinkles ended up getting more dry as well as the under-eye area.,0.0

Not impressed. I have combination skin and it kind of makes my face feel dry or tight after? Also very strong smell... I was hoping because it was in the “clean section“ it would be less fragrant but it gives me a headache actually.For me not worth the price at all.,0.0
"I have tried to like marula oil in the past...I just wasn’t sure it was for my skin until I used Drunk Elephant’s Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil. It’s fantastic as a stand-alone or an addition to the other DE products. As a stand-alone, it has moisturized and firmed my skin; adding it to other Drunk Elephant products or using immediately after those products increases the moisture-retention my face has. It isn’t a cheap oil and now that I have experienced the difference for myself it’s not hard to see why. Worth every cent!",1.0
Used a few times now and I must say I am impressed! leaves a soft bronzed glow and not orange! I only use 2 drops in the evening so I’m not sure how orange it would get if you used more than that (it says you can use up to 13 drops!) but just with two I’ve noticed a healthy glow. smells kinda funny though,1.0

Based on other reviews I thought I would love this product. Unfortunately it has caused one of the worse breakouts I’ve ever had. I am pretty sensitive to fragrance and this product seems to have a pretty strong scent so I’m assuming that’s why it doesn’t work for me. Will be returning.,0.0
I love all the products I have from Inkey List! This one fell a little flat for me. I will say i love how smooth it goes on and it’s not at all greasy which is a huge plus.

Overall not impressed but I still have lots of products from this brand that I want to try!,0.0
I was hoping this mask would help my skin while my area went through the windy season. After reading all the great reviews I decided to try it out. It was the biggest waste of money.

"If your someone who is sensitive to breakouts with products, you must try this!! For 4 years I’ve been searching for a moisturizer that doesn’t make me breakout and I have FINALLY found this cream!!! I love how quickly it absorbs into your skin.

I live in the northeast of the US and it’s getting very cold and windy and this cream does help a lot keeping my skin moisturized. I will definitely be purchasing again.",1.0

"Using this serum is a real pleasure. It has a lovely delicate fragrance and the serum has a lightweight texture that just sinks into my skin so nicely without leaving my skin greasy or sticky. I love the bottle, it’s quite unique looking and looks lovely on my dresser. The serum helps to make the skin so soft and smooth and also helps plump the skin. After using the serum for the last few weeks I’ve noticed that my dull, winter skin is looking glowing and radiant. I suffer with uneven skin tone and I’ve noticed this has really helped even out my skin tone. It has really given my skin confidence a boost.",1.0

I really wish this worked for me but sadly, did not",0.0
"I bought this to brighten up the winter blahs. It is very concentrated so you need only a quarter or half a pump mixed in with your regular moisturizer. I smooshed it all together before I applied it otherwise you get too much in one spot. I used both hands to evenly apply everywhere including my neck and up into the hairline(barely). It gave a bronzey glow to my skin and then I just needed blush and to do my eyes and brows.

Noticed no change to my skin after using this product regularly for a few weeks solid. This is more expensive than other vitamin c serums I’ve used and the lack of results was disappointing. Also worth noting I bought this per sephora employee recommendation and after reading so many glowing reviews in store. Not happy at all.,0.0
They changed these wipes. They used to be a really good exfoliant and now it’s all soft and barely does anything. Really upset they changed them.,0.0
I was really excited to receive this product . Redness has always been a big issue for me . The only problem I have is that it is way too light for my skin and makes me look dead and dull. It would be great if you made a color for darker skin tones. As a woman of color I would love to also be able to cover my redness. Thanks.,0.0

Amazing product! Really helped with my rosacea which I wasn’t expecting. I can wear this during the day underneath makeup with no issues. This stuff really changed my skin. Even my husband noticed a difference!,1.0
"I wanted to love this product because I really like the brand but unfortunately it made me break out on the corners of my lips and cupid’s bow. once I stopped using it they slowly disappeared. I decided to try it again because I thought maybe it was something else that made me break out, it happened again!  I have given it several tries but it’s no use, pimples are annoying and hard to hide specially on that area",0.0
I suffer from cystic acne and this product does exactly what is necessary. It helps clear up cystic and surface level blemishes. I am currently using it with Drunk Elephants Retinol and the peeling and overturn of skin cells is helping my skin heal. I would recommend using the smooth side of the pad if your skin is sensitive. I’ve been using tit twice a day for over a week and have already noticed a change!,1.0

"I have tried many different versions of Hyaluronic Acid serum. Some are thick, some are sticky & some are unpleasant. The Inkey List’s version is so light & feels clean when you apply it to your skin. It feels like a cool drink of water for your complexion. It is not sticky & it does not leave a residue. I recommend this product & I believe it is good for all skin types.",1.0
I got this as a sample and it was for me but my mom ended up falling in love with it so it looks like i’ll be getting us the full size one lol this smells incredible and it makes your skin feel nice and soft and smooth and hydrated. Its literally like water but turns into cream. Its incredible! I highly recommend this for dry and/or combo skin.,1.0
"Let me start by saying this product is incredibly luxurious. It smells incredible (like real cucumbers and not the artificial, head-aching inducing cucumber scent) applies beautifully, is soft and silky and thick without being sticky or uncomfortable, and skin looks incredible right after application. In the morning, my face is definitely more “plump”, but that goes down about an hour or two afterwards. I’m about 3/4’s into the bottle, and I can’t say I’ve noticed improvements in my overall texture or fine lines. This is one of those products that makes you FEEL good, but doesn’t really offer much else. I want to love it because I spent a lot on it, but it didn’t do as much as I’d hoped it would.",0.0
La mer cream is the best cream I have used. This time I gifted by La Mer. I always stock a lot of when i catch a good price. Because it can recover my sensitive face skin. Every time I use it I put a little bit face oil and use my warm hand softer the La mer cream. When the color become transparent I can put on my face. It smells really light and joy. I will keep buying it.,1.0

"I was very excited to see this was an rewards option, since I’ve wanted to try it for some time.

"I love this product! It makes my skin super soft and hydrated my skin throughout the day. I normally have dry and oily skin. I use it as a primer and makes my makeup look matte.

I sometimes wear it by itself and makes my skin look beautifully. I love it!",1.0
"I have recently decided to go all in on drunk elephant, and this was the last addition to the collection. I’ve used cleansing oils and balms before so I basically knew what to expect. Pros: - takes of your makeup. Like a champ. Even waterproof.  - I love using the including physical exfoliant with it. Leaves my skin feeling very smooth. Cons: - smells like cooking oil gone rancid. Maybe a fresh batch would be odorless and mine had been sitting in a warehouse for a while? - feels like rubbing crisco on my face. There’s nothing light about it.  - it doesn’t emulsify or “turn to milk” when you rinse with water. It just stays oily.  - this is more like a triple cleanse than double cleanse product, because it can sometimes take two additional washes to get this stuff off. Less is more.  - initially had an increase in breakouts but it has subsided so I can’t say whether it was due to this product or not. I’m pretty sure when this is gone I’ll switch to Clinique or farmacy, or maybe go one-step with Tatcha. But I guess I’ll finish it. It’s good enough. I guess.",0.0
"I recently purchased this and have used it 3 times. I am leaning towards it not being something that I would order again. I don’t feel that it actually helps reduce the size or redness of blemishes. It has a very strong chemical/medicinal smell and it almost just causes me a headache every time I go to use this. The smell does go away after applying but in the mean time it’s strong. Also, the smell lingers around on my finger, even AFTER I was my hands! I know many of my friends swear by this product- I think it’s something that just wasn’t a hit for me but could very well work for others.",0.0
It makes your skin dry and causes breakouts.  I don’t know why ppl rave about this cleanser.,0.0
"For starters - if you are debating buying this, go in and get a sample! I did and received enough to use the product for about a week before ultimately deciding It’s not for me. First try, I made the mistake of using the drops alone and that was a mess. They are very concentrated! I followed instructions after that and mixed with different serums and moisturizers. That did definitely cut the concentration down and have a nice even glow. However, regardless of what I mixed it with, it still was sticky and made my face oily all day. (To the point my hair was sticking to my face around the hairline. Gross.)At the end of the day, it is what it is...this is a bronzer and it acts exactly like you’d expect a bronzer to.",0.0
"Works immediately to really soften lips, even perpetually dry and cracked ones like mine. The rose scent can be a bit strong at first but it’s not completely unbearable and I’ve gotten used it, and I’ve become sensitive to smells since I started getting migraines. It definitely is an oily gloss though.",1.0
"Very moisturizing, quite thick so more of a night eye cream. Lasted me three months and honestly didn’t do much for fine lines and wrinkles. Overall decent by not totally worth the price imo....",0.0
I received this product for free from Influenster to test and review. I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I feel like my skin is definitely more glowy and radiant. The ingredients in this product are also amazing hence the price. I also really enjoyed the way this product felt and applied on the skin. If you want to splurge on this I definitely recommend!,1.0
Love this serum. I love that it’s clean and free of garbage ingredients that can harm you. I love the fresh scent it has and it leaves my skin looking great. I have noticed my skin seems more healthy when I use this product. I suffer from dry skin and this stuff really packs a hydration punch.,1.0
"I purchased this item a few days ago. My lips have always been chapped and it seemed as though no lip balm purchased from the drug store could ever cure it. This salve does! The smell is very pleasant. It is not to overpowering but you can still smell it. I do not smell it when it is on my lips. My lips actually feel moisturized, and the salve is not just sitting on top of my lips like other balms have done. I apply it about 5 times a day just because I like it so much. It’s cheap too. The only problem is that the container is hard to open which is why I gave four stars instead of five. When I purchased I thought the lid twisted off but instead it’s just a regular lid where you need to pull it off. When fully closed it takes me about 3 mins to open and it hurts my fingers to do so. I only half-way push down the lid when I close it now so it is easier to open.",1.0
"It’s ok, I guess. It feels borderline greasy, and the moisture doesn’t really last for my dry-ish skin. It does have a smell, but the texture bothered me more.  I much prefer the Drunk Elephant Protini moisturizer. It might work for you if you like a heavy-feeling moisturizer, but your skin isn’t terribly dry.",0.0
Not a moisturizer for me... it doesn’t really absorb very fast on my skin. I’ll prefer Tatcha water cream than this in terms of absorption. Two stars for nice packaging and pleasant fresh smell. Won’t buy this again.,0.0

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. To be honest, I wasn’t really expecting much just because I’ve tried essences in the past and haven’t noticed much difference. But I have to say, I’m impressed! The built-in spout thing that dispenses the product is really nice and you can even shake the bottle and only a few drops come out, which is perfect for applying to the entire face and gives me a feeling that this bottle will last me a long time!! When I wake up, my skin feels SO soft and smooth and looks so calm, I’m not sure if it’s because of this essence itself or because the essence helps my other skincare work better, but I’m IN LOVE! Redness is reduced and my skin also feels less oily in the morning, which is something I’ve always struggled with! I’m still on the fence about whether to purchase this after I run out. $95 is pricey.. but I think it’s worth it!",1.0
"The only reason I’m giving this product 2 stars is because it left my skin feeling very hydrating & doesn’t have a strong scent to it which I like. However, after using morning & night for 5 days my skin broke out. I have combination skin and it is usually very clear. I hardly ever break out. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and ended up being very disappointed! It didn’t work for me, however it may work for you.",0.0
i saw  good reviews regarding this face wash. the ingredients sounded rich and healthy.

I personally don’t like these wipes at all. For my face they are not too bad but they take forever to get most of my mascara off. And they make my face burn just a little bit. Could be because I’ve never used them before and my face is trying to get used to them. Does have a strong fragrance.,0.0

"Love this. I’m not loving the price quite as much as the product-but either way, this has helped to shrink my large pores, brighten my skin and keep it clear of blemishes. It’s almost like a translucent type brightness, that I have not been able to achieve with any other product. I say that because obviously a glow cream or something like that-is going to brighten my skin but that’s temporary as it just gets washed off or fades away. After consecutive usage, this stays, after washing your face, glow stays. Since my goals were clear, bright skin with smaller pores-and it has worked for that purpose, I am happy with this product.",1.0
"I have been using this for maybe a month or so. I apply it at night after my retinal and before my Moisturizer. I apply 3-4 drops all over my face, I go right under the eyes with it. It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. Some nights I fall asleep before putting on moisturizer and my skin still feels hydrated in the morning. Many Serums give me white heads and I did get a small one but I’m not sure if it was this serum or something else but I’m continuing to use it and I’m very happy it. Great price.",1.0
I have a lot of dark acne scars and noticed this had dramatically lightened up the spots even the first day after applying this.

Takes off every bit of makeup off my face and my skin has never looked better- no more clogged pores as I’m able to get everything off effectively before bed.

"This was the first serum I ever bought. I did really like the way it made my skin feel and definitely made me glow-y. For that, I think that this is a really good beginners option for people just starting to dabble in serums, or skincare in general. That being said, it is a very very thin product and I it ran down my fingers before I could actually press it into my skin so I found myself doing weird theatrics with my hands to get all the product onto my face. They more I learned and read up about serums in general, but vitamins C in specifics, I think I just got more advanced than this product. I dislike that Sephora doesn’t say what type or concentration of vitamin C is in this serum. This is pretty standard practice for most brands out there. They’ve also neglected to answer any questions about that on the ‘Community’ or product page which makes me think that that information just isn’t available. That worries me a bit. Its also concerning that they chose a clear, glass bottle to store a UV sensitive product. Sustainability is great. Degrading products before having a chance to use them... not great. Bottom line: if Sephora opted to put this in a UV safe container, and published the actual contents of this product, I would 100% recommend. Until then... unlikely.",0.0

"On a whole, this product line was nothing impressive. Each item on it’s own lacked anything that I would call a skin improvement. And used together, I felt little benefits. It’s truly hard to rate each individual item, which is why I have grouped them all under one review.The Cleanser: the cleanser was soft and gentle, and had a nice foam to it. It strongly reminded me of the drug store cleansers I used as a teenager (Clearasil). Unfortunately, it does not do a good job cleansing. With makeup, I had to do several washes and still couldn’t remove all makeup. Without makeup, there was still a lot of dirt on the cotton pad used after toner. Clear Lotion: this is just their fancy way of saying toner. Again, nothing impressive about this toner. It did it’s basic function without leaving my face dry or sticky. Pitera Essence: this is their signature product line ingredient. The Pitera essence is meant to be patted onto your cleansed and toned skin. Not entirely sure I’m seeing the results they claim. I felt they placed a lot of emphasis on how amazing Pitera is, almost like an infomercial. Airy Milk Lotion: nothing airy or milk like about this moisturizer. It is on the thicker side, with an extremely high fragrance. Any slight cuts or open acne will burn upon application. My face was left feeling slightly sticky. Even with primer, makeup application looked streaky at best. The moisturizer truly felt like a cheap product. Overall, the product line is cheap feeling and offered very little, if any overall benefits. This Proctor and Gamble skin line is a cheap product disguised as a high end product line. Don’t be fooled. The product strongly reminds me of Proactiv, though I’d recommend the Proactiv line far over this line. The SK-II line is worth no more than $25 for the whole set, and I wouldn’t even purchase it at that price point.",0.0
Really wanted to like this! I’m about to finish the bottle and I’ve seen no changes at all. I was washing my face day and night for second seconds with this and nothing.

I’ve used this twice now and both times, I woke up with my skin feeling extremely smooth and bright. I’m excited to keep using this to see what long term results I can get!",1.0
I like this serum overall.  The bottle is so beautiful I just wish it came with an airless packaging. It is very lightweight and quick absorbing. It has a subtle plant smell but it’s not strong and it hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin. See before and after application pictures.,1.0
This moisturizer is game changer I am a real sub when it comes to SPS because they leave white streaky residue on your skin. Tend to not moisturize and don’t always have the best smell this one is a game changer.

It’s not a terrible product the product itself may work very well it’s the application I just can’t get over. The stick is firm not very emollient so when you apply it it drags and tugs on the delicate skin under the eyes. I can apply to a finger and Pat under the eye but again it isn’t very emollient or creamy so I don’t feel like I’m getting a whole lot on my finger and rubbing my finger on it doesn’t really warm it up and make it more the way I want it to be.

It’s hydrating and leaves a dewy glow even after a non shiny moisturizer. I’ve seen major results after using it for a few weeks; my skin got more smooth and bouncy. My skin is VERY sensitive so I have to be careful when choosing/trying products. So far, this serum has not disappointed me.",1.0
I really saw a difference in my skin after the first two uses. A lot of people saw a difference after a few weeks as well. This duo kit lasted me a good 2 months only as part of my night time routine. Mind you I do use a toner and Essense before the Luna oil. During 5 minute wait before using 1-2 pumps of good genes I’ve also incorporated a gua sha tool then a moisturizer to top everything off. I did stop using it for a week to see if the results would last and it held up but I think it is something you would have to continually use for lasting results. I also like that the good genes product although in a glass bottle is really in bag within the bottle. (I took it out to get every last bit the product) Therefore if the bottle breaks you won’t lose any product! All in all this kit is perfect to see if it would work for your skin before you splurge on the full size products.,1.0
I bought the small size and it immediately smelled rancid upon opening. I will not be putting this on my face or body.,0.0
I had high expectations due to everyone else’s reviews but the smell was too strong to bear. I got it for free in exchange for a review. I thought it was refreshing and super hydrating though!,0.0
Not recommend for dry skin. It added lots of texture to my already “textured skin” while just sitting on the surface of my skin.. it does NOT absorb into the pores.,0.0
I found this cream to be a bit on the thicker side and has a bouncy texture. In the winter months is fine for my combination skin but in summer might be a bit too heavy for me. It absorbs quickly and wears well under makeup. It is a fine face cream to me but hard to notice any “magic” effects that would differentiate it from other moisturizers. It also has a strong scent that is a bit powdery and artificial to me. Those who are sensitive to scents might not like this product.,1.0
"I am obsessed with this new product! It came in a nice small glass jar but the product was in a “refill pod” so if you run out, you can just save money and more sustainable by just buying a refill pod and not the whole product itself! As for the product, it’s not too heavy and left my skin GLOWY! The ingredients are great- hylauronic acid and lots of vitamins incorporated which help brighten, smooth, and heal the skin. Overall, very pleased!",1.0
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS FORMULA? It now pills & drys out my face?? They had to change this or something…can’t recommend anymore,0.0
"I love the texture and the way it feels when I put it on my skin. It also gives you a really pretty dewy-but-matte glow. Unfortunately, it makes me break out, specifically on and around my nose. :( I’m not THE most breakout prone person, but I do have sensitive skin. So so so sad this doesn’t work for me.",0.0
I have received this sample products for free from PINCHme. I can say that my under eyes became lighter and this product moisturized well. My under eyes felt soft and moisturized. I’ll continue using it and I think I’ll see better results. Overall I really enjoyed it and will definitely purchase it in future! Thank you,1.0
"I didn’t have high expectations for this serum. I e tried it before and it irritated my skin. This formula is better. First, the scent- it is a bit herbal but I also smell something like alcohol. It isn’t totally unpleasant or offensive. The serum is a good consistency and I find a small amount covers the face and neck easily. I layer it with my usual moisturizer. Ive used it for about a week and I can’t say that I notice much of a difference. I haven’t added or taken any other products away from my regimen. I’m not expecting miracles but Ive used other products that have shown some results in a small period of time.",0.0
This burnt my face even though my skin felt soft the next morning I saw redness on my cheeks I would not recommend,0.0
Got this as a sample. Was able to use it every night for a week. It felt like putting on fresh aloe from an aloe plant. I used the plant a lot growing up in the desert. This product is nothing special would never buy the full size. I did not notice a difference & been using fresh aloe gives better results.,0.0

I bought this new summerfridays mask after reading so many good reviews and watching beauty influencers post on Instagram and what I did it literally burn my face in 3 minutes I don’t understand what’s happened with my face in 3 minutes it get super swelled and burned like a hot stove .it gaves me panic attack my . I don’t understand why they playing with the face of people I have normal dry skin I never have any kind of face reaction in the past .the  ladies who’s promoting this stupid mask doesn’t know anything they just doing advertisements and playing with the face of their followers because they blindly believe on them . I have such horrible experience and never gonna try anything in future about this brand .they have pathetic customer service no one help you after 5 days of this horrible experience they answered my email we so sorry unbelievable sorry how can sorry fix some one face .,0.0
"Alright, I have combination skin that tends to breakout. This is a very thick moisturizer,  so I do not like using it now that it’s summer and 100 degrees. However I think this will be great in winter when my skin is very dry.",1.0
I’ve tried a couple different face wash and this by far is the best! Perfect for oily skin to control oils and smooth skin.,1.0
I wanted a physical sunscreen & this had mostly good reviews so I gave it a shot. The actual product is ok if a bit heavy & hard to spread evenly. The real issue is layering it under makeup - blending foundation over it with a brush caused it to pill up which made this a product that can only be used on makeup free days.,0.0
"I received this as a points sample. I don’t have acne issues, but have oily skin and was interested in a facial oil that wouldn’t exacerbate that. It absorbs well, didn’t cause any breakouts, and provided a nice level of moisture. It smells very herbal when you apply, although that dissipates. The color is the result of dyes, which I could do without. Overall, a nice option if you’re interested in a facial oil for oily/acne prone skin.",1.0
"I used to some pretty bad stuff to get rid of the dead skin on my face, but I use this once a week and my skin is flake free :)",1.0
Not that great . Its too sticky and i don’t feel my lips are hydrated . I will recommend another lip balm from the same brand . It works really well,0.0
"I have used this product for around 4 months now, and it is so so. I have hormonal acne along with cystic acne and I feel like this is a great gentle cleanser, if you need to remove makeup or even just dirt from your day. However this won’t magically clear up your skin.",0.0
"Mixed feelings about this. My skin seems to react well, but every time I use it I just think a coconut oil would do the same thing. It just mostly smears around make up and is soooo oily that it leave a slick residue after you rinse it off. I have to use a make up wipe to remove that residue as well as the leftover make up. The bottle says it “helps remove make up” which I would say is true, it does help, but it doesn’t remove it well. I will not be ordering this again. Spending more and getting an actual make up removing balm would be wayyyy more practical of a purchase.",0.0
"This makes my waterproof mascara go all around my eyes. I look like a raccoon. I figured maybe I need to scrub longer, but no it made the mascara run more on my face. I gently use this stuff while my eyes are closed and after washing it all off my vision is blurry for a minute or so. Freaks me out so I stopped using this for my eye makeup when I realized it’s sucked at washing waterproof mascara.  Not worth the money.",0.0
"Not sure why, but this formula was difficult to apply; it came out like a thick putty and would not spread evenly on my face unless I added moisturizer or oil (which kind of defeats the purpose of an oil-free SPF). It also sits heavily in my pores (I have sensitive, acne-prone skin) and requires more blending. I prefer a color correcting SPF like Dr. Jarts or Supergoop. This one’s just not for me.",0.0
"I really want to like this, but it isn’t working for me. It goes on smoothly, but throughout the day it feels like it’s not really set. My skin is weirdly sensitive to sunscreen, and it’s not loving this one. I’m glad I tried it as I know many, many people love it, but it’s not for me.",0.0
I absolutely love this stuff!!,1.0
"I was so excited to see a glowy sunscreen product because I currently layer a glowy product on top of my spf, so I thought I might eliminate a step. Unfortunately the formula doesn’t work for me—it’s heavy/greasy feeling, irritating, and the reflective particles highlight texture rather than blur it. If you’re used to the more elegant Asian and European sunscreens with newer filters, you’re going to hate this too. It just doesn’t look nice—it doesn’t blend well, the shimmer gets stuck in my facial hair and dry areas. I was just going to continue to use it up anyways (since I can’t go to a store to return), but it irritates and burns the crap out of my skin if I leave it on too long (likely one or all of the organic/chemical sunscreen ingredients breaking down and becoming unstable). Overall it’s a hard no from me, and I’d recommend saving your money.",0.0
"I was so surprised to find that I was given the full size 50ml bottle to try. Dream skin is amazing. It smells great and it’s literally the lightest product I’ve ever used. It leaves my skin so smooth and silky. A little goes a long way. 1 pump and I’m good. On non makeup days, I wash my face, use my toner and then apply Dreamskin. When I do apply makeup, I do the same routine but then add my makeup on top of it and it doesn’t change the application at all. I received this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes.",1.0
"I started getting some pretty intense adult acne this year out of nowhere. As someone who has always had clear skin without effort, this threw me through a loop. I tried EVERYTHING I could to get rid of it - on both sides of the price spectrum - and this is the ONLY thing that worked. I’ve even tried at least a dozen other spot treatments, and nothing worked but this product.Every time I have a breakout I throw one of these on and go to bed. By the time I wake up, I remove the bloated dot and the entire pimple has disappeared from underneath it. It’s like black magic.I recommend this to all of my friends, and honestly pretty much anyone I come across who is having issues with their skin. I’ve been buying this product for a couple of months now and I definitely don’t see myself being able to live without it anymore. I’ve also been impressed by the other products Peace Out offers.If you’re wondering whether or not it’s worth purchasing, just do it. I was very skeptical because I hadn’t heard of this brand before, but I am a hardcore believer now. This product has saved my skin when all else failed.",1.0

This took me some time for my skin to really get used to the product but once it did it was amazing !! I have acne prone combination skin and it has really provided moisture and an insane natural glow to my skin! I also haven’t seen an increase in breakouts which is great.

I have been using Dr jart cream before which is also good but i had to apply more as I have combination of dry and oily skin but this skinfix is awesome.. i apply little amount and it gives unbelievable results.

I got comments from others regarding my skinThis is life changing so far,1.0
Gifted by Dermalogica.My favorite. This is so fine and gentle you can use it everyday unlike others scrubs. Makes a difference in your akin texture if you use it regularly. Dermalogica always makes the best stuff.would recommend it,1.0
"I only have one con about this product, when my skin is dryer than normal it burns a little but besides that when my skin is well hydrated it makes my make up look so much better and well applied!",1.0
It moisturizes my skin okay but is definitely not worth the price. Oftentimes I find myself having to either add another layer or add a different moisturizer altogether.,0.0
"Very nice!! Not too heavy, not too light, barely scented if at all. It moisturized nicely without being sticky or comedogenic.",1.0
I received this product complimentary from goop. Their own directions state to use one a week. It comes with four. Normal businesses will allow time necessary to use as directed to post a true review. Instead they bombard you with demanding emails wanting it starting from the day after you receive it. It was fine and did what they state but the company is too irritating to support.,0.0
"I tried this thinking that it would help with my dry, textured skin. While it did somewhat clear up my pores and give me a nice glow, it was kinda aggravating to my skin (which I expected from an AHA of course) and the results didn’t seem to last a long time. I think maybe had I gone and had a professional facial done first before using this product once a week for maintenance, I might have liked it more. I’m still on the fence about this product and think it might work better for other skin types!",1.0
"The best thing about this eye cream is the rich cushiony texture! I was immediately surprised and impressed how the cream was so thick and moisturizing because most the Korean eye creams I’ve been using are so thin and watery which I don’t like. You can feel the product lightly moisturizing your undereyes after application which I love. I haven’t seen any visible benefits to this eye cream yet though. My dark circles and fine lines are apparent and haven’t improved but I’ve only been using it once per day for about 2 weeks so far. I’m giving this a 3 Star, so-so rating though because it might be slightly increasing the texture under my eyes in the form or tiny bumps. I haven’t tried any new base makeup products so it makes be think the eye cream is causing the bumps. I received from Influenster to try for free. I can’t say I’d pay $64 or recommend this cream at that price, but enjoy the good ingredients. If my eyes dramatically improve over time I’ll update my review.",0.0

Once I figured out the right cadence for me, this product became my go-to exfoliant.",1.0

Soo I don’t know. I’m just not overall impressed with this like I am with everything  Estee Lauder makes. I love their products but for this to be a new improved I just don’t see the difference. It’s a little thicker than water and absorbs well. I think there’s better serums out there than this and after a week I didn’t see the difference. I use mostly drunk elephant serums but I do use Estee’s repair moisturizer and that’s a product that is bomb! Received complimentary from Influenster,0.0
"I have been using it for 2 plus weeks now.  The description sounds more like a primer than skincare to me.  I have tried both ways.

smells like medicine and it just leaves your skin looking super gray.

"I bought this in December and have been using it since. It’s clear, so amazing for brown skin girls like myself. I hate the chemical smell it has. It has a nice velvety finish once it’s applied, but it feels like a super thick layer on my face which I don’t like. I have oily, acne prone skin, so I’m very picky with spf and just any skincare in general. This made me greasy within an hour of applying, which I don’t get when I use other spf. I also don’t wear makeup everyday so I can’t attest to how it wears with makeup. I’ll finish my bottle and I won’t be repurchasing it. I enjoy the new black girl sunscreen with a matte finish way better than this. It’s clear like unseen but doesn’t feel heavy on the skin at all. Sadly this didn’t work for me.",0.0

This mask/moisturizer is my go to for my nighttime routine (I have dry skin). I love that it’s on the thicker side and feels very moisturizing. It also completely melts into my skin and feels so luxurious.

I went through one of the 1oz jars entirely to make sure that I gave it an honest shot. The smaller jar lasted me just over a month with use every night. I discovered that the best method for me is to rub about a dime sized amount between my hands to warm it up and then apply to my face, gently working in small upward circles.

I was skeptical at first but have to say they really work. I get a few pimples around my jawline when I get my period and thought I would give those a shot. First off they keep me from touching the pimple and the patch sticks nicely and doesn’t just fall off. I can definitely see a difference after leaving a patch on overnight. The pimple is way less inflamed and not so painful. And 20 patches go a long way for me personally so I don’t think it’s overpriced either.,1.0
"I am so disappointed in this product. I was looking for a light sunscreen for my combination skin. This sunscreen made my skin a grease pit. I didn’t expect this to leave me excessively oily like it did! I tried to use as little product as possible, but that did not help either.",0.0

Oh my goodness! This product is so amazing. I am so glad that I was able to receive this product for free from Influenster. I’ve followed the directions by applying it once in the morning and before bed. My skin has been TRANSFORMED. It has never been this soft and smooth. Finally a product that works for me. It feels so rejuvenated! Definitely worth it! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1.0
"I wanted to LOVE this product. I wanted it to cure all my issues and leave my face feeling healthy. After using this, my face felt completely sticky and uncomfortable. So much so, that hair and fibers from my sheets were sticking to my face.",0.0
The product seems really good I personally didn’t see a difference because I don’t have older skin features like wrinkles because I’m 19.It was very light weight and had a great natural scent to it!,1.0

"For this price point I was expecting a little more I guess…I wasn’t impressed. Smells great, but my face just didn’t feel clean afterwards. I will be finishing it since I paid enough for it but won’t be repurchasing or recommending.",0.0
Great moisturizer! Not too heavy but rich enough to keep my skin hydrated for a very long time. I use it for nighttime routine. It’s frangrance free so it won’t irritate your sensitive skin. I like to mix it with face oils for extra glow in the morning.,1.0
"I wanted to love this, but the “beige” it fades to after application was way too dark for my incredibly pale skin. Wish it was more of a green than a beige.",0.0
Let’s talk about moister. This stuff right here is the key to unlock the every day and night face regimen for combination and dry customers. Using this my face had long lasting moister. Perfect for NO MAKE UP days. Ladies you know what I mean. Try it lovelies. Ya won’t be disappointed.,1.0

"It applies nicely to the face. Smells good. Beyond that that is it for this. It was not moisturizing, and it did nothing to help prevent redness or environmental stress from reaching my skin. I found this to be quite drying. Very lightweight. I have dehydrated combo skin.",0.0
This was a great product at first try. But it doesn’t wear very long. I’ve tried better. I also don’t like the application method as it doesn’t allow for quick convenience.,0.0
"I received a sample size of this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, the sample size of this product was really only big enough to use for 3 days, only at night. It has a very thick consistency, but it did not melt into my skin really well. It seems like I needed a lot of product just to cover my face and feel moisturized. It also made me totally break out in the 3 days that I used it, so I would not recommend this product if you have sensitive, combination skin.",0.0
"Not sure what the rage is all about. I was really expecting great things when I ordered this. It doesn’t remove all of your makeup. I use a toner after cleansing with this twice and the cotton ball was covered in foundation. I wouldn’t recommend this for removing your makeup, but it does seem to do a decent job leaving your skin feeling moisturized.",0.0
"After 3 days of using this product as directed my lips are dry, cracked and peeling.",0.0
It was light weight and fastly absorbed into my skin. It hasn’t caused any breakouts. This is a product that is worth treating yourself with. It is on the expensive side if you are on a budget. I would buy again.,1.0
To me this is more of a lipgloss than an actual hydrated for your lips it’s really nice though it’s not sticky like some lipglosses which in my opinion is the best I’m not trying to have my hair stuck on my lips lol,0.0
"I love the idea of this cleanser with antioxidants. However, I did find it left a weird film and my skin kinda felt tight and I didn’t like the scent of it. I didn’t notice any really big difference in my skin. I live in nyc and found it too stripping for the winter months. Probably would be really nice in the summer when its more humid and for being anti-pollution. This definitely popped off because of Hyram, but just because it works well for him in Hawaii doesn’t mean it works well for everyone. But not bad cleanser, but not worth the hype imho.",0.0
"This little tube goes a mighty long way. I’ve used this for the past 6 months to moisturize my dry lips at night and they’ve never been softer (during winter especially!) Can’t get enough. It smells amazing, it’s thick and lasts the night.",1.0
I started breaking out so bad after using this for 3 days. Used to have acne about 2 years ago but it cleared out and this brought it back. Stay away if you have acne prone skin,0.0
"I received this from Influenster for an honest review. I’ve been using this at night for the past month and it’s a nice night cream for the eyes. My under eyes seem slightly softer and smoother when I use this, though I haven’t noticed any change in dark circles. The consistency is very nice, it feels like a thicker gel than most gel eye creams and actually stays on the skin longer than others. The couple of cons for me are when I tried using it during the day time, I noticed my concealer pilled and I ended up having to wipe it off. The ingredients list is also super long and I tent to like more natural products with fewer ingredients. It’s pricey for the amount of product you get, and I do think other creams would do just as well or better. But this is a nice one overall.",0.0
"Threw this away after less than 2 months as it grew mold! I am very careful with my skincare not to introduce any moisture. One day, I opened it to find white",0.0
Used it twice in a row. Gave me the most horrible breakout of whiteheads on my cheeks that I’ve ever had. I’m still dealing with it a few days later. Not for acne prone skin and I usually never get breakouts on my cheeks.,0.0
"I received a small sample of the product and decided that I liked it enough to buy the full size. While I did like that it wasn’t too thick or tacky, and that it absorbed fairly well, it didn’t seem to make a huge difference in overall tone, texture, or oiliness. For the hefty price tag, I think there are other products out there that achieve similar or better results for less money.The packaging is interesting in that you push the top to dispense a small amount of product. Once I ran out of product, I broke apart the dispenser using a screwdriver to forcibly pry open the top of the pump so I could separate the parts and recycle them accordingly. I found that the bottoms of the dispenser had at least a few extra pumps worth of product left. Something to think about before you toss the dispenser out.",0.0
"First impression, smell is minimal and pleasant and a little goes a long way! It glides on effortlessly. I put this in before my makeup and it didn’t interfere. I have normal skin and a bit of visible pores. It smoothed it out a bit but not completely. Still a nice product.",1.0
The texture of this cream is like gel. It sinks into my skin quickly and also makes my face slightly tacky afterwards. I think Protini is a surprisingly hydrating moisturizer for a gel like product. I actually really like how long lasting the hydration is. It’s great for day or night. It always makes my skin so supple and dewy instantly. I just wish I could see what its polypeptides are doing actively to improve my skin texture other than simply hydrating.,1.0
"I love Tatcha although, I was sad that this product felt like wax on my lips, I prefer the laniege lip mask",0.0
"I have been using this for approximately 3 weeks.  I use it twice a day, has not irritated my skin but also has not made much of a difference.  I will continue to use it and hopefully will notice an improvement.   If I do not see any change I will not repurchase.",1.0
"Meh, these are ok. They are a little rough and abrasive feeling and left me feeling like I had a sunburn. Didn’t feel awesome, but they are exfoliating... gave them to my daughter and went back to liquid cleanser and exfoliating.",0.0
"I really wanted this to work on me because I love a lot of the Tatcha skincare products. Sadly this caused the skin on my cheeks to dry up, break and peel. I know this works for a lot of people so I won’t give it a negative review, instead I’ll just remove one star. I’ll stick with the cleansing oil and rice powder.",0.0
I am not sure what the hype is but I didn’t feel this cleanser cleaned my face at all. It’s a strange gel consistency and the smell is unpleasant. I re-washed my face afterwards with another cleanser and my face became clean which means this cleanser didn’t effectively work. It also made my lips tingle in a bad-reaction way that left the outline of my lips red.,0.0
"My favorite sunscreen of all time. It works perfect as a base too. It’s shimmering and glowy. I’m in love with it because it doesn’t break out my face. Also, this sunscreen would work as a replacement for a foundation.",1.0
It took two weeks for my skin to correct after 1 application. I wouldn’t say my skin is super sensitive as I’m able to tolerate a variety of products but I would say it’s “reactive” if you at all are sensitive try a sample first and maybe just very limited .... my skin acted as if it had a major sun burn. I followed the directions to the T!,0.0
I waited a long time for this to come back in stock and couldn’t be happier.  Love what this toner does for my combo oily skin!,1.0
I love this product! It’s super lightweight and definitely exceeded my expectations. It left my skin feeling super moisturized without leaving my face greasy. It was gentle on my dry areas and it did not break me out as most skin care does.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a product to improve their tone,1.0
"It feels thick and slimey on my face... I did some research after a Sephora employee told me about an ingredient, demethicone, that in this product. It is actually in a lot of “moisturizers” and it basically coats the face to temporarily hide fine lines and wrinkles and does not actually hydrate your skin. Do some research and you will see why this product does not live up to what it claims",0.0

Now I’m on the search for another sunscreen :/",0.0
So disappointed I could cry. My forehead was as clear as day and I wanted to try a new moisturizer. Bad idea. Two days in and I noticed my forehead had about 100 whiteheads/blackheads.

Dior in one bottle put together all ingredients to help us have a delightful skin and fight all our concerns like fine lines, uneven skin, dark spots, open pores, dryness, redness and dullness. This is your potion of youth. Feels light, smooth, silky and blendable. I use it like a last step on my skin care routine as a primer. This amazing product leave my bare skin glowing, fresh, no pores open and youthful look. As well, I’ve been using it under my makeup and works wonders, I even forgot one time to apply it under my foundation so I did it on top where my open pores are and they disappeared without move my foundation. Its smell is amazing and doesn’t bother me after I applied it. People have noticed a difference in my skin. I totally recommend it. You need it in your life.",1.0

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and honestly I can’t justify this price point for such subtle results. The product is good in the fact that is hydrates Initially but I feel that after awhile your eye starts to feel dry.

"Fell in love after one use. First time after using it literally added life to my face. My face was soft, felt hydrated and looked brighter. My skin is super dry and my skin soaked this right up.  I love the fact that this is very light weight and not sticky at all. The scent is very mild. I’ve used this every day in my daily morning routine. I haven’t noticed much help with the few fine lines but they haven’t gotten any worse with me being out in the sun more this past month. So I can say this essence has helped with keeping my skin healthy and looking fresh. Hasn’t been as dull prior to using this product!! I received this free from Influenster and the products I were given where bigger samplers. I’ve still got a good amount a product left. So if you purchase the regular sizes this will last a good amount of time! I received this product as a free sample.",0.0
I used this product bcoz I like HUDA beauty and all video I saw. But it’s overhyped. Again huda claim it’s has changed her skin but huda has cosmetic treatment done to get that clear skin . She is not real beauty & and this product overly priced and it’s pure chemical which leave your skin soft but them dead skin get hard the next day. I recommend the ordinary red chemical peel it’s not only effortable but has good result. Wishful is waste of money and overly hyped product.,0.0

This    This cream goes on smoothly and light immediately hydrating the area you apply it to. Made my skin glows and ready for make up. One thing is that it took most of the sample to use to get this result. It smells good too. I would recommend this product if you don’t need to use as much as I did,1.0

"The concept of this is great however the color comes out quite a bit orange and not tan at all. I have tried adjusting the amount of drops, how it is applied, and even tried the other lighter drops but it all comes out orange. I even had my daughter and mother try incase it was my skin tone or something I was doing wrong but nope it was orange on them as well. My daughter is very fair skinned and she was more orange than even my mother and I were. Sadly my high hopes and excitement for this product were short lived.",0.0

"Wow! I was so excited to have received this complimentary from the brand. I had never tried a dual-action microdermabrasion exfoliator. You benefit from both the physical and chemical exfoliation. It says to exfoliate your face and leave on for up to 3 minutes (my face tingled a bit). I did this at night and felt my skin smoother and softer afterwards as well as the next morning. No more dead and flakey skin.It felt like pure luxury knowing that I used a blend of four powerful glow-inducing microexfoliating minerals (quartz, garnet, alumina, and silica).Warning: This contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that may increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun and the possibility of sunburn. Use sunscreen and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterward.",1.0

"While this cleanser is gentle (I have eczema and dermatitis prone skin) I do not feel its very useful for my oily T zone. It just feels a little too creamy to get the excess oil off of my skin.

It does not have any added spf to it either. i received this complimentary to test. To be honest,  at 42 years okd, I will definitely not be purchasing this nor could I recommend.",0.0

"It gets 4 stars as a water-resistant sunblock for intense outdoor days, such as going to the beach or hiking. It lasts and water will not wash it away! I would not use this sunblock everyday, since it leaves a cast, has an oily appearance and stings my eyes.

That leaves using it as a sunscreen on beach or pool days, although I feel like it leaves a slightly white cast in full sun. I’m glad I purchased the smaller size to start with.",0.0
I did receive a full bottle complimentary to test and review. This product dried out my face badly. I saw no good changes and I have been using it for over a month. I don’t recommend this at all. You’re spending a lot of money for a name and something to dry out your face.,0.0

If I’m diligent about applying a hydrating serum and heavy moisturizer after I use this, then I feel I can really reap the benefits of this product.

Oil breaks down latex and turns it into gum-- since this is a company that has made a name for itself in skin-related chemistry, this choice is really puzzling to me (and calls into question the quality of the product). I have half a bottle left and I can’t even use it, because the dropper handle has rapidly degraded into a soft, sticky mess. I would never purchase this again until they replace the packaging; they should just use a glass bottle with a restricted lid, like those designed for essential oils.",0.0

I finished the bottle and did not notice much of a difference on my hyperpigmentation. It did make my pores appear small, and have some sort of glow. I repurchased the kit because my mom liked the glow it gave her skin. We have both moved on from this product now and will not be repurchasing it.",0.0
"This is such a genius product! Add a little bit of this stuff to your existing moisturizer and it gives such a healthy, natural glow- no orange tones at all. I also find that it evens skin tone and smoothes my pores which is perfect for summer when I don’t want to wear a heavy foundation. Absolutely worth the investment!",1.0
Smells lovely and works super well. I put this on before bed and my lips do not feel dry when I wake up in the morning.,1.0
I received a sample of this for free through Influenster to test and review. Of all the products I have received I have never ran to purchase a full size so quickly. Within a day I started to see the results on the wrinkles on my forehead which I have had for a long time. I was blown away by how quickly the lines started to smooth over. I highly recommend this product!,1.0
If you have sensitive skin beware. Broke me out severely after first use.,0.0
"Feels nice after my toner, but I think it’s a bit too watery. Not sure if it does much to help my skin. I have oily skin, so I suppose it’s definitely better than essences that are too thick.",0.0
"I absolutely loved the old formulation - it was lightweight and smelled amazing. This new formula has the weirdest smell (although it states it is newly fragrance free) and is so sticky. Very disappointed, will be returning asap.",0.0
I’ve been using this cream nightly for about 1.5 weeks and so far my skin is loving it! The texture is pretty lightweight and a little goes a very long way! Since switching to this cream my skins tone and texture appear more even and my skin looks much more plump! I’ll definitely continue using this cream! Gifted by fresh,1.0
"I wasn’t expecting to like this product tbh.  My T-Zone is oily and my cheeks are dry so I thought this would be a dud for me however, I was wrong! It leaves my skin super moisturized and feeling so healthy. I cannot give it 4 stars because I feel like it tugs at the skin until it warms up but, massaging this in with my jade roller is perfection. I use it every time I want to skip the makeup but still have a bright, fresh, face.",1.0
Wouldn’t recommend this for combo skin. It will definitely stick to every little dry patch you have. Product looks amazing on the parts of my skin that are more oily or have no dry patches. Wish this worked for me. Prepped my skin as much as possible and it still stuck to my dry patches. Amazing for the oily gals.,0.0
I never had problem with my skin!!! This cream break my face!!! This brand should be destroyed!! I am very disappointed!!! I hate you so much!,0.0
"Bought it in-store. For reference, I’m a 430 in FB foundation and wear the shade Ganache in Laura Mercier’s skin tint. This was my first time using this product, and I wasn’t particularly impressed. The texture is very thick. It felt “heavy” and had a yellowish-gray tint on my face. The next-to-darkest shade was way too light for me, so it got returned. For what it’s worth, it had really good coverage.",0.0
This cleansing balm works amazing to get your face clean. The only downside is it says to leave on your face for 10 minutes. As a busy mom I don’t have time to leave it on that long. So therefor I only did 5 minutes and it still did it job. My face felt clean and refreshed afterwards.,0.0
"I have dry skin and although I don’t wear makeup that often, this moisturizer is a must have for my skin before applying makeup. It is not too heavy or oily, even though it tends to appear oily at first it dries without leaving your skin sticky/shiny. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions on my own. That being said, I’m not sure that this moisturizer is great enough to spend as much as it costs.",1.0
"If I could only use 1 product for the rest of my life it would be this. Got lazy with my skin routine, broke out like never before and almost got to the point of buying acne medication. Used this two nights in a row and my face is glowy and clear again. Note: when this product is fresh, it does leave my skin red afterward, but after a while it tones down, but without losing efficacy. The packaging is superb at preserving it!",1.0
I’ve been through a lot of lip balms/chapsticks/glosses in my day. But none have been so extremely moisturizing for my extremely chapped lips. My sister in-law got me the sleeping mask and it was an amazing product so I gave this one a try. And man are they a perfect duo. But you don’t even need the mask to see amazing results from this balm.,1.0
Listen I love self tanners but this one was so disappointing! It develops overnight (I have a medium skin tone and only used two drops) but it leans ORANGE. No thanks!,0.0
This is the first review I have ever written on Sephora. I have in the past battled with cystic acne and I currently struggle with a bit of it around that time of the month. I scar easily. I have used COUNTLESS drugstore products and serums including vitamin c serums ( like timeless 20%+ferulic acid) and none have come as close to delivering results as this has. I received it and as a tiny sample and after 3 days 80% of my acne scar “dots” where gone or tremendously lightened. I am hooked.,1.0
"I received a sample of the Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream through @Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  This product is a lightweight gel moisturizer containing Santorini Grape Extract, Salicylic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, and Willowherb Extract.  It is best for those with oily, combination or sensitive skin. Benefits:Poreless complexionBalanced all-day hydrationSmooth skin canvas My experience:  I liked how lightweight this cream was, as it absorbed quickly without any greasy feel.  My skin does feel soft and smooth after using, but I don’t think it is a good match for my skin type (dry/dehydrated), as I don’t really have issues with large pores or oiliness.  It does contain salicylic acid as well as lactic acid, so the cream has some exfoliation benefits, and is not irritating. I received a sample size, which was enough to use for about 8 days (directions say use a nickel-sized amount for face & neck). I used it during the day as it isn’t moisturizing enough for a night cream (at least for me).  I would recommend for someone with oily/acne prone skin.  The only con for me is that it does contain added fragrance, but it is a mild smell that I didn’t mind.",1.0
Absolutely hate this cleansing balm. It doesn’t take off even a little bit of my makeup and leaves a thick waxy residue on my face. It’s not even worth using as a normal cleanser because it doesn’t lather or get into your skin at all.,0.0
Received this product as a free sample from Influenster. This would work as a good summer moisturizer. It sinks in quick and left my skin feeling soft. I would recommend if you have oily or combo skin. If your skin is dry I would try something more moisturizing,1.0
"Megh—I wanted to like this, but it just didn’t do it for me. It has a waxy, oily (but smooth) consistency. I felt like I couldn’t get it off my skin. I always had to double cleanse!! Wasn’t very good even at removing eye makeup. Would not buy again.",0.0
"I bought the mini version to try out and my skin feels so soft! I have been using it at night after I use my face wash as a moisturizer and I fall asleep with it on. When I wake up, I wash it off and my skin feels so soft and looks moisturized. I usually have dry patches around my nose and they disappeared since using this! I also have sensitive skin and it has not broken me out what so ever.",1.0
"I was so excited when I received this product from Influenster to test. However, it didn’t even live up to half of the things I had read about it. I think I could notice a slight change in my skin but it definitely wasn’t spectacular and definitely wouldn’t be worth the price of a bottle. I REALLY wanted to love it. I also find the packaging is inconvenient. It’d be nice if you could dispense the appropriate amount from some kind of dropper or something. I often ended up pouring too much into my hand when using. If I had actually paid for the product, I would have had an anxiety attack over the amount per use.",0.0
I received this product as part of my VoxBox and I really wanted to love it. When I put the mask on it did tingle a bit but not for long and actually felt good on the  face. I didn’t feel like I saw any results the next day. My skin looked exactly the same. Maybe I need to use a few times to see true results but at this price I will most likely pass.,0.0
I got this in my Play! Box and I love it. It removes all my makeup including mascara and waterproof eyeliner. Does not sting my eyes. I will definitely be purchasing!,1.0
"I am blown away by this cleanser!! It is sooo creamy and makes my skin outrageously smooth! I haven’t used a tatcha cleanser before, but I think I found my new holy grail cleanser! It smells amazing, and exfoliates without the harshness! It has the tiniest exfoliants in it. I couldn’t stop touching my face after I used it. It left me feeling clean and balanced.",1.0
"I love this product gifted by Fresh, it is instantly moisturizing without being too heavy. The tint it gives is very natural and simple. It’s buildable and if good consistency, no sticky mess here. Additionally, packaging is everything to me and the packaging is so sleek and shiny, a real minimalist gem.",1.0
I repurchased this after enjoying the first bottle and something is definitely different about the new one. It has an awful scent which I never noticed in the first one and it doesn’t feel as moisturizing our nourishing. I typically use it on my cuticle and sometimes pat a small amount on dry patches on my face but this smells so bad and even seems to be drying out my cuticles. I don’t think I’ll even finish using the bottle even though I paid good money for it. What changed?,0.0
"I was gifted by La Mer, the Moisturizing Cream for review purposes.  I’ve tried a decent number of rich creams but this one is the most unique in terms of texture. It’s a rich, creamy balm that has to be warmed up before applied on the face. I do feel like the cream can drag on my skin, even after warming it up and spritzing my face prior. I do really really love the look it gives. A blurred, dewy canvas that works well under makeup and to sleep. I’m more impressed by it than I expected. Because of the price, I don’t see myself using this everyday. But I would definitely use it for events, and nightly use. I see myself buying this, when there is a sale. I don’t need a lot so I think it could last me a bit . I do feel like this is a luxury item, so not necessary, but it is special. And I would splurge on it! This could easily be five stars, once I see if there are long term effects from using it.",1.0
"This mask is the best overnight mask I’ve ever used. I can’t believe how hydrated and smooth my skin is the next morning. It didn’t feel heavy or sticky and it delivered so much moisture to my sensitive and dry skin overnight. I looked dewy and glowing the next day, like I got a good night’s sleep and some healthy sun. Very impressed with this product.",1.0
"I received this product as a free sample.B-Hydra is a very hydrating Pro-vitamin B serum with ceramides that truly feels amazing to my skin.The texture is very lightweight and it gets absorbed immediately after application. I truly feel like my skin is begging for it since it gets absorbed right away. I normally apply it at night time after I double cleanse and follow it with a moisturizer for extra hydration during dry/cold days, however I use it by itself most days since I have combination/oily skin and I don’t need to wear a moisturizer everyday.I enjoy the fact that Drunk Elephant formulates their products free of parabens, essentials oils and fragrances. They are perfect for people with sensitive skin like myself. They are very safe for everyone!B-Hydra is a product that I truly enjoy and I will continue to use. My skin just feel healthier and it seems more radiant, brighter and even after continuos use of this product. I wake up with plumped healthy looking skin every morning thanks to this product :) The packaging is as perfect and cool as all the other DE products. I would recommend Drunk Elephant B-Hydra for anyone looking for a serum to help replenish nutrients while delivering complete hydration for a young healthy looking skin.",1.0

"I loved this product at first because it did minimize my pores and help with my dark spots, BUT I started to notice it was drying out my skin immensely. I was using it for a long time and then after discontinuing use for about a week, I tried it again and it made my skin feel painful and starchy just like it did before.",0.0
Wow! This serum is like gold! My face is so soft and silky after using this magical stuff! It smells so soft and subtle and it really helps my skin look and feel better after each use! The bottle is cute and the product is easy to pump out. I literally only need 1 pump for my whole face.,1.0
"Terrible eye cream. I don’t have sensitive skin at all and my skin is used to abs tolerant of retinol. However, this stuff made my under eyes burn!!!

"So my experience with these amazing healing dots is that when I put one on a huge forming zit that I was getting it did zilch, but once it fully formed and I picked at it in my sleep (which is unfortunately something that happens often) I slapped one of these babies on and holy shamole did it severely reduce redness and swelling, even softened my scab so it could settle into a position that I could cover it with makeup and have it not look obnoxiously obvious. This is an amazing product that I’m now a fervent believer of, despite the price and despite the fact that they stick so naturally to my skin that I accidentally wore one to work",1.0

"Product was Gifted by GOOP beauty.I was very excited to receive this product. Especially because I love Gwyneth Paltrow. The pads are nice love the little finger pocket. It’s a double sided which is also a bonus. However when I apply them to my face they are extremely tingly it’s actually a little bit more of a burn than a tingle. It doesn’t last very long but it can be a lot at first. I haven’t noticed any brightness to my skin but it does feel softer. Was really hoping for more, especially for the price",0.0
"OMG!! The best lip mask. Makes my lips so soft and smooth and hydrated, I love how it feels on the lips non sticky super comfortable and smells like fruit yogurt I like that.

I have now persisted for a week and the spots are there every day. Would not purchase and don’t understand the hype around this product.",0.0
Probably the best hydrating mask I’ve ever used. It does such a good job at hydrating the skin and making it feel so smooth. IIt truly gives you a glow lit from with in after using it the FIRST TIME.

"I was able to try the Clarins Double Serum through a convenient 7-day sample set. I like that one of the main plant extracts in the serum is turmeric because of the anti-aging properties and that it helps to bring out your skin’s natural glow! The formula is easy to apply and doesn’t leave my skin overly oily or tacky like other serums do. Although I think more time was needed to see and feel the long-term effects of the serum, my skin did feel very hydrated after each use, which is great because the winter months tend to dry out my skin. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #GotItFree",1.0
"This moisturizer is the BOMB! I have extremely oily skin and provides me balance. I’m no longer oily and this works wonders. I mix this moisturizer with 1-2 drops of the maracuja oil.  You would think that adding an “oil” to oily skin would be a disaster...but it’s just the opposite!! My skin  is left supple, hydrated, plumped, and all-around healthy with no oily residue or greasiness. I tried this as a sample. I plan to purchase the regular size.

I got a sample of this bc tatcha is amazing but pricey so I had to try before I buy. I’m combo skin and I really enjoyed this cleanser and the little exfoliating granules. But there are deff cleansers I LOVE for cheater. The thing that really got to me about this was the packaging. The container is such thick plastic that it’s impossible to squeeze out. I never get it on my first try and always drop the bottle a few times. I thought it might be Bc it’s a small trial size but looking at these other reviews it seems like the case for the large size as well. It drove me insane.,0.0

However, after some extensive research, I was disheartened to discover that many of Tatcha’s products do in fact contain “fragrance“ in their ingredient lists. Even though the percentage is on the lower side, I do believe its slightly unfair to label consumer products as “clean“ with such a high price tag.

"So for a while I thought that this might function as a slightly cheaper “dupe“ for Volition’s celery Green Cream. The marketing certainly makes it seem that way. Unfortunately I have been using it for two months and finally have to face the reality that it really isn’t working for my skin. The product has a very strong, albeit pleasant scent. It feels quite sticky on the skin, and takes a while to sink in. Personally, it makes me look a little too shiny. When I first started using it, I had a bit of a surge of breakouts, but figured that was purging from Mandelic Acid I started using a couple weeks prior. So I waited for that “purge“ to end. Unfortunately, it never did! Similar to a reviewer a few days ago, I developed a new kind of chin acne while using this. More than a dozen little bumps that never come to a head or go away. I also experienced plenty of almost cystic forehead pimples and a lot of clogged pores/blackheads in general. The texture of my skin became very rough using this. Typically my complexion is actually very clear, and I have never reacted to a product this negatively before. A couple days ago I caved and bought the celery green cream again, and my many pimples are already going away. So clearly this moisturizer was a complete failure for me... I hate to leave 1 star reviews, especially when the product works so well for so many people, but wow my skin looked bad after two months of this moisturizer.",0.0

"Just finished a jar, the texture looks nice but I find the cream is too oily for my face, it is not absorbed and leaves a thin layer, which doesn’t help applying my powder foundation, leaving streaks all over the face. Definitely not recommended.",0.0
I liked the idea of this and it was enthusiastically sold to me by the sales lady but this did not work for me.  Exacerbated my acne and had a strong scent that was at times overpowering.  Waste of money for me.,0.0
If you have sensitive skin or prone to products clogging your pores then stay away from this product. It broke me it terrribly. I have extremely sensitive skin and also have rosacea. What I have learned from trial and error just because a product is all. Atrial does not mean it will always react well with your skin,0.0

"I really wanted to love this, but after using this for a solid 2 weeks, I just don’t. I have normal skin, not dry, not oily. Once I started using this daily, my skin became oily and blemishes sprouted. I also have pretty fair skin and this brought out redness in my cheeks which took away from the nice dewy effect. Definitely only use this on a freshly cleaned face or it will start to ball up and flake off. Also, do not get it in your eyes (or sweat so it runs) because you will regret that immensely. I suppose it was good as a sunscreen, but nowadays that’s not too hard to find.",0.0
"I haven’t broken out in years, but recently have been experiencing pretty steady breakouts from wearing a mask all day. The product seems to be working great, especially for the price! It’s gentle for my sensitive skin, but still soothes the mask breakouts and hydrates the skin.Full disclosure: I pair this product with Tarte face wash,  toner, pimple patches, and either a balancing- or hydrating-focused serum depending on the time of day.",1.0

To used this for 6 months and haven’t had noticeable results for improvement of dark circles and puffiness. It did leave my skin super hydrated though. This is good for winter and if you have really dry skin but it doesn’t do what it advertises. I wouldn’t purchase again.,0.0
amazing overnight cleared my little acne bumps and smoothed my skin and my skin is glowing!! you need this trust me it’s worth the $$,1.0
I love this essence. I have only been using it for a couple weeks but I am already starting to see a change in my skin.,1.0
I honestly wasn’t the biggest fan of this. I love the cleansing oil but this had what felt like little grains in it that felt rough. I felt like it was a lot messier to clean my face with than the oil.,0.0
Great moisturizer! I really love the consistency of the product and how great it feels on my skin. I don’t normally care for any fragrance or scents but this one wasn’t to strong and so I can deal with that. Gifted by Fresh,1.0

"I have combination skin and this moisturizer did not work for me. It feels nice upon initial application, but after a few moments of wear my face felt dried up. It didn’t matter how much I put on, within a few minutes it felt like the moisturizer had left and taken the moisture from my skin with it.I tried to make it work for a month to see if my skin would adjust, but my skin kept itching slightly and breaking out in random spots. After a month of my skin acting up, I wanted to look at the ingredients to see if there was something I missed that was causing my skin irritation. So, I flipped the glass moisturizer jar over to inspect it closer. The ingredients weren’t listed there as I expected, but I saw black specks sitting inside the bottom of the jar. At this point, I realized I may have recieved a faulty product. The seal was removed when I had first opened it, but I just assumed it had come off into the lid as I unscrewed it. I ended up returning the product.Despite my overall experience with the product not going well, I am still giving the product two stars because of the two redeeming qualities:1. I love the brand philosophy of Youth to the People and I would still happily try their other products.2. I think this product could possibly work well for people with super oily skin. I don’t think it’s a bad product; I think that it just didn’t work well for me.",0.0
Love love love this! I have sensitive acne prone skin and have tried everything under the sun.. this helps sooo much and it’s only been a week.  I will buy this again and again. No new acne... dried up old spots and helping the redness  from them go away. Face is sooo much more moisturizer.  Smells like Arnica:),1.0
This stuff is so great! So affordable!! My skin feels so soft and more plump. I use it at night and it the morning applied to damp skin! Recommend it to my friend and she loves it too!,1.0
"When I kept seeing this brand and product all over my feed, I wrote it off as nothing more than silly hype and moved on.. until I received a sample, studied the ingredients, and tried it for myself. And... well, I’m so sorry I misjudged this product. If your skin is begging for hydration, it’s excellent on its own or as a final moisturising step for your skincare routine. A little goes a long way, and it’s so very worth it.",1.0
"While this costa a little more than I usually spend on skincare, I will continue to buy it. The ingredients are great (and clean) and i have seen a huge difference in my skin. My pores are noticeably smaller and my skin is softer.",1.0

A Sephora employee suggested this moisturizer to me because I was looking for a new moisturizer to replace my Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel. It’s very lightweight & a little goes a long way. After washing my face with the Belief problem solving foaming cleanser I apply a small amount on my face & also add a few drops of vitamin E oil.,1.0
I wanted to like this because of the clean ingredients. It was light and had a nice texture. But it broke me out and I woke up with oily skin after putting this on before bed. And I am not someone who typically gets pimples.,0.0
This product doesn’t smell all fruity or flowery it smells more like medicine but the smell doesn’t linger but you face will thank you. No breakouts at all. My pores look amazing and I can go without makeup. (Using the entire line). This cleanser is the start though.,1.0
"Received a sample with a purchased product.  Tried it 2 nights ago. Initially I like the interesting “feel“ of the product.. unfortunately that is the only thing I liked.  My skin did not enjoy this chemical peel and thatvmay be my own fault but it definitely damaged my moisture barrier and my skin’s surface. Going on, it felt ok. Taking it off, I noticed a light flush.  Last night though was the worst.  My skin is screaming every time I touch it now, when I wash and even when I moisturize!   I looked up reviews online and found a video from James Welsh showcasing this product and he also mentioned that there is an array of ingredients that are known to irritate skin.   Too late for me.   This was my personal experience with it, it may be different to others of course.  I just felt I needed to voice mine and try to help people decide if they are new and curious and want to try this product at all that this may happen.",0.0
Works really well and amazing price!  My skin is smoother and clearer after just 2 uses.,1.0
"I like Fresh (am a big fan of their lip balms and soy face cleanser), so I had high hopes for this. I do love scented cleansers, particularly if they smell bright and energizing (think Bliss’s now discontinued Fabulous Face Wash or even Youth to the People’s cleanser). I assumed that this would smell fruity and fresh (no pun intended), but it...didn’t. Obviously, scent isn’t the most important aspect of a cleanser, so I’ll also say that I wasn’t a fan of the consistency of this. It’s sticky and a little gritty, and while it dissolves fairly quickly, the texture is just unpleasant. It really feels a bit like smearing strawberry jam all over your face, which is...not ideal.",0.0

"I have a pretty consistent skincare routine but I’ve been missing a moisturizer that feels like its working on my skin. I got a sample of the Belif True Cream Aqua Bomb and I was blown away with how quickly it moisturized my dry, acne prone skin. It absorbs quickly, without a tacky feeling and I can feel it sink into the driest parts of my face. It’s the dead of winter in NYC but the moisture this product gave me lasted all day between dry subway cars and an even drier office.",1.0
I received a deluxe sample and was able to use for a little over a week.  Did I see any of the benefits that they claim?  Not really.  The only thing I can say about it is that it’s a really nice moisturizer and a little too much for me to use in the morning.  I used it at night and I did notice my skin was softer.  I would like to buy a bigger size and give it more time.,1.0
only reason i’m giving this two stars is because i thought i loved it and really i still want to love it it’s the most amazing formula and makes my eyes look so glowy and feels amazing and it really hydrated my eyes because i have the worst dry under eyes but it pills and balls up so badly at the slightest touch near my eyes and i barely use any not sure why this does this i’m so upset because i love the formula and the way it looks so much,0.0
I’m still on the fence about this one after 6 days; I’m hoping it will last for awhile; no scent or chemical that bothered my skin which is good.,1.0

"This is a good product only if you have OILY skin. My skin is dry-ish but it gets oily during the day on the T zone. But when I started using this cleanser my skin would literally peel off. I honestly recommend it only for very oily skin, as it does dry up your face quite a bit.",1.0

"A better name for this product would be “peel gel” not “scrub.”  I found it to be similar to the PTR FIRMx Exfoliating Peel Gel, but not nearly as effective. It was also difficult to remove from the small vellus hair on the face which was annoying. I was expecting more from this product due to the hype around it and was let down. There are other products that offer better results in my opinion.",0.0
"Very excited to give this product a try. It is thick and has a slight fruity scent, not overpowering. It is a little tacky after application and would recommend to those with dryer skin as at feel a little heavy once it’s on the skin.",1.0
"Very nice cleanser on my dry skin, I feel much more hydrated after using it than I do with many others. Nothing wow about it it’s just a basic everyday cleanser but it does the job well.",1.0
I received this product as a gift from Olehenriksen and once I received it I couldn’t wait to use it. The promise to instantly brighten and reduce the look of pores drew me in. The consistency is something I’m really not a fan of as it reminds me of toothpaste. I put it on my face and it was pink and as I started massaging it in it turned white. Within 5 minutes of having it on it started tingling and it went away as time went on. After washing it off I immediately noticed how much brighter and hydrated my skin now is. Looking forward to see what it does to my skin after long term use.,1.0

I used this product daily for 10 days using approximately a dime size portion. The product goes on very nicely and is absorbed quickly.  My face and neck felt very silky while using the product.

Something is up with this formula and as a loyal Josie Maran customer for years I would love to know what happened.",0.0
#freeproduct #trywithtopboxUnfortunately like the cream and eye cream this sample was not big enough to have an actual result in seeing a difference with my wrinkles.

"I received this PreBalm complimentary to review. When I got it, I was so excited, because I recognized the brand as being one used by a local spa (although I had never tried any of the products before).  Following the directions on the bottle, I began by rubbing oil into my face (dry hands and dry skin)... the massage felt great, and the scent is LEMONGRASS- my fav!! I was able to rub it on and around my sensitive eyes with no negative side effects.   When I added water it became milky, and I continued to massage gentle circles to maximize how it was working, then I rinsed it off with warm water. My face immediately felt soft and SO clean! I can already tell that my face is cleaner after using my face wash. The bottle is pretty large, and will last a LONG time. A little goes a long way! I will definitely repurchase this product when I do run out!  I received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes, and now have a new favorite to add to my skincare routine!",1.0
"I read all the great reviews on these so I was excited to try them. Since turning 30, I  have for the first time dealt with acne, mostly around my chin. Clinique makes a cream that has seemed to help speed up the healing process but I wanted to try these because a lot of people made it sound like they would disappear over night. Unfortunately that has not been my experience. I have been using them for a week now, nightly and I see literally 0 improvement. Perhaps they only work for certain types of acne, I’m unsure but if you’re looking for a quick fix, these didn’t work for me.",0.0
I really liked this but after using this  along with the face wash for a month my face broke out! The smell of citrus had a calming effect on me. I put this on at night and morning.

"I will start off by saying I love the brand as a whole and I have always been impressed with each Fresh product I’ve used. This serum is so nice, a little goes a long way and it leaves my skin feeling plump but magically leaves no trace of oil or residue just hydrated skin.",1.0
"Smells amazing. Used before bed with other goop products. Really feel the exfoliating textures, skin felt and looked glowy after. Would recommend. I received this product for free for an honest review.",1.0
"If I could give this zero stars I would, such a disappointment. I had received a sample size and absolutely loved my results so I decided to buy a full size. I had seen a couple bad comments saying they had changed their formula but I didn’t pay them any mind because of how well it worked for me in the past. I used it for a month hoping i would see the same results I once had but unfortunately it broke my face out horribly. My face was close to clear but this product set me back and now it will take my face another month or so to get back to we’re I was. I have oily/normal sensitive skin. What didn’t work for me might work for you but please take my experience under consideration when making your decision.",0.0

"Product didn’t do anything to my skin (mostly in terms of brightening). After about a month of using this serum, I ended up breaking out on my forehead. The scent of it was nice and subtle but I’m guessing the fragrance irritated my skin.",0.0
"I think of this as a next level face scrub. Other reviews I read called this a “facial in a jar,” and I’d agree with that sentiment. You can use it 2-3x a week. The beautiful thing about it is that it exfoliates two ways: manually (with grains), and chemically (with glycolic acid). Massage it into skin and leave on for 2-3 minutes. The results are on par with a professional/spa microdermabrasion treatment. Silky, soft, so smooth. I will say that you can use the tiniest amount so the jar lasts a long long time! I received this for free from GoopGlow in exchange for my honest review. I will definitely be adding this to my skincare routine.",1.0
"It burned my skin every time I used it! I’ve posted 2 reviews before and they keep getting deleted! DONT USE THIS PRODUCT. I saw all the great reviews and decided to try it, but jeez this burned my skin so badly and gave me terrible acne. It’s not worth it!",0.0
"The love the purple packaging.  The formula is nice and light and feels nice going on.  It did dry my face out some.  So I switched to using it every other day, and that was better.  I did noticeImprovement in the small wrinklesNear my mouth  and between my eyes.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.",1.0
I really wanted to love this because it smells sooo good and feels so nice while you are applying it however it was not very hydrating. Once it soaked into my skin my face felt dry and almost as if I needed moisturizer. It is light weight and soaks right it but did nothing to hydrate my skin so I had to return it.,0.0
"This stuff is amazing! I’ve seen awesome results by using this scrub. I use it 2-3 times a week and I’ve seen acne scars fade, skin is brighter and my skin feels clean after all the gunk is cleaned out.

It may work for much smaller pimples than what I had. Definitely not working for me. Waste of money!!!,0.0
"I tried this product for about 2 weeks. It started to break me out really bad, but I pushed through because I thought it might just be a purging period. Sadly the breakouts didn’t stop, and my skin was just covered in an amount of acne I hadn’t experienced since my mid teens. It also felt really drying and my skin felt right after every wash. Maybe this product isn’t for sensitive skin? If you’re interested, I’d look into getting a sample before you jump in and buy it.",0.0

"This product is super hyped up (understandably, considering how affordable it is!) but i didn’t really notice a big difference. I’m not a huge fan of the texture - leaves a bit of a sticky residue on the face, which is remedied by a moisturizer after it dries. Wouldn’t recommend for dry skin!",0.0
I use this entire line as my routine.  This product has really helps clear any issues that my skin had and makes it feel so smooth in the morning.  I used to suffer from monthly breakouts and terrible oil.  I have seen a GIANT improvement in my skin.  I love this brand!,1.0

"I was super excited about this product because everyone gave it such great reviews. It didn’t irritate my skin or leave any particularly weird residues (especially if I put moisturizer on afterwards). However, it really didn’t do anything to clear up my skin or even my skin tone. I’ve been using it for over a month now and haven’t really seen any difference.The only reason I’m not super annoyed is because it was only $9 so I don’t feel like I was completely robbed.",0.0
"I received a deluxe sample of this product with a promo code for my online order. I was really looking forward to trying it as I have textured cheeks and am always looking for products to help with that. I really like the REN brand (animal cruelty free) and have used some of their products in the past. I also really like the idea of an AHA toner that can be used both morning and night. With that being said, I have used the product in the morning for the past week with little results. The product definitely leaves my skin feeling sticky, even after applying my moisturizer on afterwards. My face feels heavy, as if the other products are just sitting on top of my skin, not sinking in because of the stickiness of the toner. Overall, I will continue using it to see if the results improve but I think I will try rinsing it off after a minute to get rid of the sticky feeling. I would suggest trying it for yourself to see if it works for you but only if you can get a sample. Not worth the money for me.",0.0
"I’m amazed by how much I Love this product. My under eyes were experiencing some dryness and didn’t look too cute Whenever I put makeup on them, especially when set with a powder.

I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes.",1.0
I’ve tried this cleanser on two seperate occasions (months apart) really wanting to love it as I had gotten it in a gift set both times. the first couple of days to a week would be fine and then all of a sudden my cheeks would start to get small/medium sized bumps and become very red. it goes away almost immediately when I would stop using it so it had to be the culprit. I switched to drink elephant and the redness and bumps are almost completely gone one day later.,0.0
"I have already received a few samples of this product, and unfortunately I find this product to do nothing.The oil feels good on the skin and it is not sticky, but does absolutely nothing. I appreciate Sephora for being generous with samples, as spending money on a rather high-end product should leave you satisfied with the results of it. If you are curious about marula oil, get one from a cheaper brand instead. I have tried a few, and they feel and do the same(in my case, nothing special).",0.0

"I purchased this after hearing many great reviews, and because I loved how affordable this product is.  I have tried many cleansing balms, and unfortunately this is my least favorite. This product is extremely thick, which would be fine if it actually emulsified. Once you put this on, it seems impossible to get off. I had to use two different strong  foaming cleansers afterward, and even then I could still feel a film on my skin from the cleanser. The next day, I woke up with a small breakout on my cheeks. I really wanted to love this, but sadly I won’t be repurchasing.",0.0

"my literal savior when it comes to dry skin. i’ve had oily skin for most of my life and around September of 2021 i started using tretinoin for my acne. i had the tightness, dryness, flaky, peeling skin associated with tret. it was uncomfortable and every move i made with my face reminded me of what my skin looked like. i would apply this and get IMMEDIATE relief. it is smooth, has never broken me out, never clogged my pores, and provides lasting hydration that i truly believe makes my skin better and better with each use. because i’m still on the oily side, i only use this at night. i was hesitant at first with the price, but it is truly worth every penny. the product is amazing and on top of that i LOVE the pump!! anti acne bacteria products have truly been amazing in clearing up my skin and i love the peace of mind of knowing i’m not getting germs into the product every time i use it. 1000/10.",1.0
"after reading all the reviews i was very excited to try this product, but unfortunately it didn’t work for me like it did for others. It made me breakout more.

"OMG. I hate this so much. I’m not joking you that I have the whole DE line, from the face wash, bars, oil, serums, eye cream, and moisturizers. I love DE and it’s my main skincare line, but this is horrible. It doesn’t melt the makeup at all, I already don’t wear foundation but it doesn’t melt my concealer, eyeliner or mascara at all, and that’s a total deal-breaker. Obviously, it’ll melt eyeshadow, but even water does the same thing. What’s worse is that it hurts my eyes so much. I’ve tried so much melting balms in my life, from banila clean it zero to the clinique take the day off make up, and honestly those two retail for about the same price but THEY MELT the make up off AND don’t hurt my eyes... This was such a disappointment... and honestly, out of all of DE’s cleansing products, the only thing I enjoy are the bars (peeke and juju), even Beste isn’t the greatest (as it claims to remove makeup too). Both Slaii and Beste are only good if you’ve been bare-faced the whole day or maybe had a makeupful of glossier on your face, cause that was the only time I saw nothing left on my face. I’m only also giving it one star because I only enjoyed the bamboo booster and that’s it. If they can sell that separately and in a bigger tub with some kind of massage cream that comes with it. I’m all for it. Disclaimer - if you’re wondering if I used it with the bamboo booster and that’s why my eyes hurt, no I didn’t. The way I use this is 1) bare balm to “remove“ makeup/sunscreen/glossier face (this is the part where it claims that you can open your eyes and it’s tear-free as some people have demoed on instagram), rinse with water and pat dry 2) another scoop and add the booster as an exfoliant and obviously avoiding eye area - T-zone and cheek area only targetted, rinse and pat dry. I’m just trying to finish it so my money isn’t wasted. I wouldn’t repurchase.",0.0
"When winter came around this year my face was feeling like a straight up raisin. My skin was SO DRY. Despite using my belif moisturizer which is normally just fine. I bought this because I wanted something super moisturizing with peptides in it like the DE protini. I like it more than protini because it actually moisturizes my super dry face. In addition to solving my dryness I noticed my skin was much more luminous a couple weeks after using. After about a month my fine lines were noticeably lessened. Keep in mind I’m 29 so my fine lines aren’t THAT deep. All in all, I highly recommend. Keeps me moisturized, fine lines smoothed out and it’s $18 cheaper than protini!",1.0

This product makes my skin feel so soft. It has a very light scent. Works great!,1.0
I did so much research on the ingredients on this and decided to try it because it is one of the cleanest products I’ve been able to find. The texture is great and I love the smell even though it has no artificial fragrance. It sinks into the skin right away but the minute I started using it my skin got even more dry. Right when . I put it on I got dry patches almost everywhere and my skin got flakey in spots where I usually don’t have dry skin at all. As the day went on I noticed my nose getting more oily than usual. I don’t think this is a bad product it just didn’t work for my skin.,0.0
"I got this as my Birthday Gift option this year along with the cleanser. I’m not someone who cares what the packaging looks like, I’m more concerned with if the product preforms. I hate to say, this is pretty awful. It’s incredibly fragranced, tinted purple (why?) and stays tacky for quite some time. I don’t see any benefit to adding fragrance to skincare.",0.0
"I purchased this recently and have only used it about 2 or 3 times, but this stuff is amazing! I wake up with smoother skin, breakouts that are much smaller and less “angry” looking, and I’ve already noticed a slight reduction in the lines on my forehead. Can’t recommend this enough.",1.0
"The texture was a lovely, serum-cream like consistency which wasn’t tacky on the skin. So that was great. I wouldn’t say there was an immediate illumination to the skin. Also, despite being a regular vitamin C user, this left a rash all over my neck (see the picture). I had to stop using it after a week. I’m afraid this isn’t the serum for me. Vitamin C is a great active though, so if your skin tolerates this product, you may see great results. For me, I’ll be sticking to other forms of vitamin C like L-ascorbic acid.",0.0
"I spent some points on trial sizes of this after a friend (who is VERY against spending more than $20 on a skincare product) raved about it after getting a sample. It helped her acne scars and dullness so much she actually bought a full size! After not being thrilled with the DE C-Firma (my husband swears by that one though), I fell in love with this! It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and is even moisturizing. During the hot summer I can get away with just this as my moisturizer, and I have fairly dry skin and use prescription retinoids. This has helped so much with my acne scarring from a freak breakout I had 6 months ago. I also struggle with redness/mild rosacea, and shockingly this has not made it worse. I don’t know that it has helped with the rosacea, but I do have many more “good days“ now than I had before.  My skin looks so plump and glowy! A little goes a long way, as long as you PAT it in. It sinks in very quickly and feels sticky for the first 30 seconds, so if you rub it in it will drag and not go as far. Has a VERY light citrus scent.",1.0
"I received this cream as a trial-sized part of a holiday package.  I’ve been having problems with my face chapping, particularly in areas under my mask.

My face is noticeably smoother, hydrated, and balanced.  Love it!",1.0

"This was a decent product. Very rich formula, takes a while to dry and it’s very uncomfortable to sleep with. Is does well with getting rid of dry skin on my face but I wouldn’t repurchase this because of the high fragrance content. There is no purpose to fragrance in beauty products.  You’re just putting irritants on your face. I love this brand but not the fragrance and greasy feeling.",0.0
"This serum is lovely! It has a nice and relaxing scent that isn’t overpowering like many other green tea products.  It dries quickly leaving my skin feeling smooth, soft and overall more plump and bouncy. It’s very hydrating as well and I have noticed a big improvement in my skin’s overall hydration.",1.0
I’ve tried quite a few different toners. I got this originally as a sample and purchased the full-sized soon after. It definitely exfoliates (so maybe not the best for very sensitive skin) but leaves my skin glow-y and smooth after using it both day and night. Love it.,1.0

"I got a trial size of the berry lip mask in my bday gift, and I was on the fence about buying it because of the price. I’m currently on accutane so this is a lifesaver for my lips at night. It sits on top of your lips all night like an actual “mask”. I wake up in the morning and my lips are not dry or cracked. If I wasn’t on accutane I don’t think I would NEED the product, just regular lip balm would do. It’s a nice to have, not a need to have.",1.0
"I don’t use this everywhere, however I have found it great for getting rid of pimples or blemishes overnight! I use the smallest amount on the affected area, and then the ordinary moisturizer over top. Word to the wise: it only works if you use moisturizer after applying. Otherwise it dries out on your skin and becomes almost flakey. I only use this at night and just run my hands over my face first to feel for any pimples that might be coming through. Every morning I wake up with my pimples gone or at least greatly reduced!I would not recommend this to be applied all over the face if you have dry skin though.",1.0

Heard good things about this product and decided to try it out. Really was not impressed.

However it’s like you’ve dunked your face into a gold and is on the heavy side (greasy). It looks much worse when the sunlight hits. Gives off a yellow tint. I do not recommend wearing it under your face mask or changing outfits right after application (best to get dress prior to applying) bc the color/shimmer will transfer.  I have fair/light skin. I’ve attached a photo of my hand with a thin layer applied onto it. it’s a golden yellow color. Maybe it would be more suitable for darker complexions.",0.0

That is the reason I won’t be using it again but if you’re looking for a super thick product then this might be for you. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.,0.0
This oil smells very hippie-esque (is there patchouli in this?!) and left my face greasy and a bit irritated. could be that I’m not a face oil person  though- this was the first one I tried. it could be good for people with dry skin but on my combination to oily skin and under moisturizer it does not feel good!! there is an oily film on my face and when I touch it my hand comes away shiny!,0.0
I was honestly skeptical about this cleanser because I was absolutely certain no cleanser could totally remove waterproof mascara but I was so wrong!! I’ve tried just about every makeup remover and nothing and I mean nothing has come close to Dermologica! I’m a triple mascara coat kind of girl and even the top brand wipes don’t remove all of the residue like this cleanser does!! I’ve used this cleanser for about 1 week and honestly don’t see myself using any other facial cleansing products in the foreseeable future! Even simply cleansing i see my skin looking clearer and healthier!! This product is absolutely amazing!!,1.0

It’s light feeling, perfect amount of hydration and definitely blurred red and hyperpigmentation.

"Really wanted to love this product as I’ve seen such great reviews about it. Personally I did not have any issues with packaging. I have rosacea and combination skin and have heard that this works with sensitive skin. I’ve tried different ways to incorporate this in my skincare - mixing it, using it alone, using it with serums, etc. - but it just leaves my skin irritated and flared up. After I apply it, my skin would look fine for the next day or two, and the dryness and redness and sensitivity ensues on the third day and lasts for 2-3 days. I need to use medicated cream to calm down the mild rosacea. Very sad that I can no longer use this product, and after trying to introduce it in various ways over 3 months, I can no longer return the product. Disappointed that I wasted my money.",0.0

"I wanted to love this and had waited a while to purchase it so I was extra excited when I finally bought it. Honestly, I feel like I could spend $4 and purchase Vaseline and put it on my lips for all that this did. I tried it a few times to be sure. It never soaks into your lips, it just kind of sits on top like Vaseline does. I used it overnight a few times and each time I woke up with it still on my lips and when I wiped it off my lips felt no smoother or softer. I even used a lip scrub first to exfoliate, then applied the lip mask. Same thing. Again, I reeeeaallly wanted to like this, but it’s a no from me.",0.0
"Immediately upon applying this product I can feel how rich and hydrating it is. Only con is that I wish it had packaging that allowed for a pump, as application is a bit difficult and leaves you with greasy hands, but it’s definitely manageable over time.

I generally apply moisturizer over top, but if you don’t have dry skin you could just use this product on it’s own. *I have received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0

I would use it as a daytime moisturizer but I would want something more rich for my nighttime skincare. Due to the sample size I am unable to comment on any long term effects.",1.0

This product is absolutely amazing. I have recently started using retinol that is safe for the under eye area and was super excited to try this. Price point is great compared to some of the medical grade skin products and results are amazing.

"This is my first time using a Tatcha skincare product and I’m really excited that I have it! I have noticed my skin being a bit brighter after using it for about a week and a half. My one complaint is just that you have to tip the bottle and shake to get drops out. I DO appreciate that it doesn’t just spill out like crazy, but it’s just harder for me to apply this way. However, that is definitely not a deal breaker by any means! I would definitely recommend it!",1.0
"I’m a die hard Drunk Elephant gal but this does nothing for my skin. I believe it’s just hyped. I haven’t seen any resurfacing changes. I did like that its a very light weight serum since I don’t like going to bed with heavy products. For some odd reason I put this on my neck area and thats where it really worked because it left a burn on my skin it took some time for me to exfoliate and let it heal. I’m not sure what the deal it. Face = nothing, Neck = burn. Packaging it cute but formula offers nothing impressive for my skin.",0.0
"I love this product because it’s an easy way to take care of underlying redness on my cheeks. It works almost instantly and controls redness through my entire workday. It’s very light but you can achieve a good amount of coverage with by simply using more of it, so it can serve as a base for foundation/concealer or be used on its own. I would absolutely recommend it! Well worth the money.",1.0
"I’ve used about a third of my bottle and I don’t have any real results to share. I’m 27 years old, so aging isn’t a primary skin concern of mine yet.

"I received a sample of this in a recent order and although it’s very hydrating, I developed numerous painful under the skin breakouts after 1 use. I have ultra sensitive, reactive and acne prone skin so I’m hype vigilant about ingredients and avoid products that contain essential oils and significant amounts of plant and flower extracts as they irritate me personally. While the ingredients in this didn’t cause concern, something in it didn’t agree with my skin. I think those that aren’t sensitive or acne prone and have normal to dry skin may like this but I think it may be too rich and heavy for those that are combo or oily.",0.0
Amazing product!!! I love it so much! I mix it with the dew drops and leaves my skin so hydrated and glowing!,1.0
My nose was so dry and peeling constantly in the winter and after using this one time all of the peeling and flakes were gone. Seriously incredible. I have never been so impressed with a moisturizer and I normally use both Drunk Elephant moisturizers and neither came close to this one,1.0
I have been using this for about 4 weeks and I have noticed a difference. I love this product. It has made my skin look amazing. It has reduced fine lines and has made my skin plumper.  It does have a sticky feel to it. My skin absorbs this up fast. Btw I am closer to 50 and this product is really a blessing.,1.0
"It has become my favorite cleanser! I have very dry and sensitive skin, it is interesting because it PERFECTLY cleanses and at the same time does not dry the skin.

I bought the sample size of this to try out and absolutely love it so far! I have only used it twice but I love that I can just put it on dry skin and it just gets rid of it.

"I wanted to love this product because I’ve used Sunday Riley products in the past and loved them, but unfortunately this one was no good for my skin. I broke out pretty bad in my t zone with whiteheads within days of use. Maybe it was a skin purge? Maybe that’s normal? Maybe my skin just doesn’t tolerate vitamin c?

So I would advise anyone with any bit of sensitive or acne prone skin to skip on this one.",0.0
When I first ordered this product I was so excited to try it out. I used to product for about 1 month and I didn’t see any changes but more breakouts. When I apply the serum it makes me skin itchy. For me I didn’t like it but maybe it’ll work for you!,0.0

"I like that the CC Oil-Free Matte Cream is 40 spf. I find it hard to find a good matte sunscreen. When I applied it lightly on my face, using my fingertips, I thought the product was easy to spread evenly. I was a little disappointed with the result when I applied a thin layer, so I tried applying a thicker layer. Although I thought this produced a better look initially, the cream quickly created lines in the fine wrinkles I do have around my eyes and nose. Additionally, the product leaked in transit from the where the tube is joined to the pump-style top. This may be because I live at high altitude (7,000 feet). Needless to say, the pump does not work, but I was able to get some product out of the tube from where it was leaking.PROS: 40 SPF, light feel when applied sparingly, matte finish, stayed on well for a full day of wear.CONS: packaging issues, need to apply heavily in order to achieve the “before/after“ shots used to advertise the product.I received this product from CC in return for a product review.",0.0

"I received this product free from IT cosmetics in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. Let me start by saying that I have never used a CC cream so I have nothing to compare it to. But I do wear foundation and Bb cream on occasions. I found this product to be a little heavy. I know that it’s supposed to be full coverage but it was a lot heavier than my foundation. I applied it with a  beauty blender and it went on smoothly. Only 1 coat was needed as it is very thick. At first was skin looked very smooth. It was matte for a while but after a few hours my natural oils started coming through and my pores appeared large. So their claim of a 12 hour matte finish is not true. Besides the directions on the box says to reapply every 2 hours. I couldn’t imagine doing that because one coat is already so heavy. On a positive note, I do think that the color was a decent match for my skin tone. But at this price point, I don’t think that I would purchase this product.  I’ve used drug store products that gave better results.",0.0

"These work extremely well for fading scars and improving texture. I have had one bad acne scar for the last month, and after just one treatment it faded considerably! I also have some texture on my chin, and it helped with smoothing that out. For the smell- yes it’s strong, but nothing that I minded. Kind of like bad fruit?  Overall, I think this is an amazing treatment that will definitely help even out skin and scarring. I did see a little more glow, but nothing crazy. I bet results would come more long term, but you are only supposed to use this once a week, so it could take awhile. Knocked off a star because of the price (but goop is never cheap)!",1.0

I don’t find it difficult to rub in despite using A LOT of product. It doesn’t leave a white cast on me but I’m also a lighter skin tone so I can’t speak for deeper tones. After applying this, I spot conceal and set with translucent powder, then I’m good for the entire day! No greasiness or heaviness from when I put it on until I take it off at night!

My first bottle smelled more chemically and my 2nd bottle smelled more sweet. On my 2nd bottle I am not noticing as much results. With my first bottle I got radiant and clear results. My 2nd bottle no radiance and breaking out. I figured I would try and use it again thinking maybe it was just a fluke. Now being on my 3rd bottle same thing happens.

Last Christmas they had a set with a full-sized and two trial sizes so I got that and started using not only as a sleeping mask, but as a lip balm through the day. Lips are hydrated, glossy, and I don’t have to constantly reapply like literally every other lip balm out there. PLUS, I kid you not, it is now October and I’m just now finishing up one of the trial sizes. I have no idea how it’s lasted so long because I use it constantly, but a little bit clearly goes a LONG way. p.s. It smells delicious.",1.0

I received this serum complimentary from Glow Recipe. This serum made my skin feel really hydrated and plump. I am going to incorporate this product into my skin-care routine because it feels really great on my skin. The texture is really nice and lightweight. My skin looks hydrated!

"I have very dry skin and I was hoping that this would serve as a one step moisturizer underneath my sunscreen and foundation. It’s just not enough moisture for me. I have weird skin: it’s very dry but also acne prone. The good news is that it didn’t cause breakouts and probably prevented breakouts but this is not a one and done Acid + moisturizer that I hoped it would be, especially if I’m using a drier SPF like clean screen. It’s better under murad sunscreen (which usually pills like crazy but works great with this product).",1.0

"I received this #freeproduct for testing and review purposes. Opinions are my own.If you’ve used the lip sleeping mask, this product is somewhat similar in scent. Not as much strawberry candy scent as the original lip sleeping mask, but the berry balm is close. I tried the others in store and found I liked the pear scent a lot more than this one, and I definitely prefer the lip sleeping mask scents to the glowy balms.It comes out somewhat thick but immediately melts onto the lips comfortably. Its not very sticky, which I like. I am not a gloss fan, but this was okay for me.What disappointed me is its lasting power. This absorbed far too quickly for my liking, and I sort of felt like my lips were a little oily when it became remnants. Whereas the lip sleeping mask makes for a much better balm (I use it day and night!).Price is another issue. I can’t recommend this product at this price. You’re better off getting the lip sleeping mask, which goes a long way.",0.0
"Only good thing about this is that it feels nice on the skin, but that’s about it. I only feel moisturized while I have the product on, but as soon as I wash my face, all the moisturizing disappears with it. I’ve used it for a month now and no change has been made to my skin at all, I’m still super dry. And I know the issue is with this product specifically and not my skin because regular moisturizers like the ones from Belif do a great job moisturizing my skin and I feel the product affects even after washing my face.",0.0

Background: I used to have extremely oily skin, and then suddenly I turned 29 and it changed to very, very dry. After 30 this spring, my forehead was so dry that if I touched it, flakes of skin would rain down like dandruff. I tried all sorts and they would only keep it at bay for a few hours.

"I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin, and while I didn’t experience any irritation or dryness like others reported, and I was able to use it every other night right off the bat, I found this product made my skin look really gross. My pores looked large and gunky, tone looked super dull, didn’t have any affect on scars or dark spots, and any acne I got took FOREVER to go away. I really wanted to love this product, but I feel like it was a major setback on my skincare progress and I will be returning.",0.0
"I never knew that I had a need for a product like this until I tried it. One of the most unique toners/products I have tried. This is so effective and helped me repair a damaged moisture barrier. I use this everyday, morning and night, after my actives and before moisturized to help hydrate my skin. It is so soothing and nourishing! I recommend shaking this directly into the palm of your hand and patting it into your skin as opposed to using a cotton round. It is much more effective this way since you really want this product to sink into your skin. This product does such a nice job that I can forego moisturizer all together on warmer days. Will definitely repurchase!",1.0

It has a very light clean scent, it is creamy and rich but in no way greasy or heavy. It sinks right in and I can feel it moisturizing my skin immediately. I am spending a lot of time in the sun this summer and this has definitely been my go to moisturizer. It feels really good on my skin. I am really very happy with it and you should try it too!",1.0
OMG this Rice Wash smells amazing!  The texture is very lightweight and smooth.  I really enjoy how a little goes a long way.  I really like how it makes my skin feel super soft afterwards!  I definitely give this 5 stars!  Plus I really like the color of the bottle and the feel of the bottle (very soft). Highly recommend giving this a try!,1.0
As a dental student that studies late nights I need a good eye cream and so far this one’s been amazing! I like the cooling and hygienic applicator tip and cute packaging.

I’ve tried many different lip scrubs and products to help since my anxiety makes me pick and lick my lips so they get extremely dry and chapped! This is the only one that has worked overnight in a day to make my lips nice and healthy and normal! I use it several times a day! I even use the Laniege Glowy Lip Balm throughout the day when I’m out and about and can’t use the lip mask! Chap stick just doesn’t work for me! I’m so glad this is available in the US! I love Korean skincare products!I can finally use and wear matte lipsticks thanks to this healing product!,1.0

Before being sent this to review I had been a Kiehl’s product fan for over a decade. This moisturizer is my favorite. I have dry skin and like a thicker cream to keep my skin moisturized. This is a heavier cream but it doesn’t feel heavy on your face but really keeps your face looking nice and not dry at all. I highly recommend this and would give it more stars if I could.,1.0
"I received this product as a free sample from influenster.I absolutely despised it. I really thought I would love it. It appeared to have good skin friendly ingredients. It felt light. And lets be honest, greek yogurt is really all the rage. It can’t be bad for you, right?I have sensitive, combination skin. It gets dehydrated really easily and anything that can give hydration through out the door, especially with me taking on and off my mask (nurse), it can get dry. I have not changed anything else in my skin care regimen and it wasn’t my time of the month, but I ended up with not one..not two but THREE huge cysts with one right above the center of my eyebrows.I was an oil slick at the end of my work day and I’m sorry this didn’t work, at all.

"The best sunscreen for people with oily skin and enlarged pores! SPF 40 is great especially since it doesn’t feel oily and I live in Vegas. Has a silicone-like feel and acts like a primer and helps with oil control. No white cast whatsoever since its formula is clear. Only downside was when I used a new moisturizer, this sunscreen would clump up under my makeup. So I stopped using it for a while and tried 4-5 other sunscreens. I got a new moisturizer recently and tried it with this sunscreen and they are like a match made in heaven!",1.0

"Got this in a sample packet that contained enough product for me to use four times on my face and neck, and I am so torn!!!The consistency of the toner is thicker, almost like a runny serum and does indeed hydrate as it tones and tightens. The skin on my jawline and cheeks feel tight during the dry down after applying the toner, but my skin still feels hydrated. It went under makeup really well too, and doesn’t cause any piling or shifting when makeup is applied.Now for the bad part. The scent is way too strong and artificial, like a watermelon jolly-ranchers candy on steroids... I am not usually sensitive to scents as most of my skincare and hair-care products have scents and I love scented candles for the home and do use perfume. That said, this serum gave me a headache every time I used it. I really wished the perfume smells lighter and less sweet, but more fresh and just-picked watermelon/melon. All in all, if not for the heavy and cheap-smelling fragrance, I would purchase a full size as it is a nice hydrating toner that is a “clean” formulation without use of alcohols that can cause premature skin aging.",0.0
"The softest cotton squares you will ever use and they do not leave fuzz on your face after removing your makeup. I used to use the ones from the drugstore which can be scratchy. However, ever since trying these, I haven’t looked back. I don’t think I can ever go back! It’s also a great value as you get 165 squares for $10. That is a great price, especially in comparison to everything else sold at Sephora! I buy them two at a time during the VIB sales to ensure that I’m never without. I very highly recommend.",1.0

I used up most of this product and it did nothing for my face...I was talked into it by a Sephora employee that the natural ingredients would help my sensitive skin and help my dryness.

I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks and I use it after putting my serum and it’s helped my skin feel moisturized. I didn’t notice any other changes on my skin besides not feeling dry.

"This product can be pretty drying and harsh. I used it in combination with the Natural Moisturizing Factors & HA and I find my skin stings a bit, even a few months later. Occasionally when applying I found this product “frothed“ up like soap. It also makes your face pretty shiny so not great for day wear without something to mattify. I definitely did not see great results with this combination of products and am breaking out more often, but will continue to experiment with the Ordinary products given the price.",0.0
"I have been testing out this product for about 4 weeks now and I am very happy with the results. My skin was very dull and it lacked moisture. This helped keep my skin moisturized throughout the day and it also provided sun protection. I also noticed less redness, thanks to the cica. I think this product would be very helpful for when I start retin-a. I layer this after my moisturizer and it works great that way. Definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.",1.0
"Although I received this particular jar complimentary to review, I have actually emptied this twice with jars purchased on my own. I love everything about this cream.

"During the winter time, everything is just dry on my body, lips included. They’re continually chapped and your drugstore lip balm will only go so far. So on a whim I bought this product and I am EXTREMELY HAPPY. One night and my lips felt so transformed, to these plump lush lips with no dry skin or cracks! I didn’t feel the need to put on a lot of product as the instructions suggest, and it was fine, nothing to wipe off in the morning. When you put it on it looks like a lipgloss (not as shiny) and it isn’t sticky. I find myself putting this on before I leave the house and not just for nighttime use. Highly recommend!",1.0

"Wow, I’m still very impressed with Origins charcoal mask. I am a huge mask beauty guru tried literally everything in the Korean beauty market and Sephora as well. I must say this is the best pore minimizing clay mask that does not dry out your skin. My skin became very sensitive and quite dry due to Rein-A so I am afraid to start this product again but I remember using this clay mask EVERYDAY in my 20’s and it controlled my acne and helped with my enlarged pores around my T-zone. To enhance the results, I would microwave a wet towel for a minute then I would open up my pores prior to applying this mask. Actually, I will order this again so that I can clear up my pores on my T-zone area. :) I was really disappointed when I couldn’t find a 30mL size mask at Hillcrest mall prior to lockdown. Can’t wait to start this beauty regime again!",1.0
Received this #freeproduct from TopBox for an honest review. I found this serum to be ok. Nothing special or exceptional as with other clinique products that I’ve used in the past. I used it for a week each night before bed and after the third night I noticed that my face had a break out. The texture is more on the liquid side but a little goes a long way on your skin. Not heavily scented which is a good thing. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this to family and friends and wouldn’t purchase it.,0.0

"I got this cream as a sample and I liked it; it was light, non-greasy, moisturizing, and smells nice (like a light scent of cucumber). The only thing is, it is absolutely not worth the price point.

The scent is also really light and pleasant, actually smells a lot like lemonade! I only wish it came in a pot with a lid so when i get to the bottom it would be easier to get out the last bits",1.0
So I received this product free of charge from influenxter.  I am giving my honest opinion.  Iam using this and keep using this product.  So I used and been using this but since I don’t have wrinkles and all I di not see any difference.  Another thing is for a product that you put around the eyes. It is a bit heavy as that area is very sensitive.. I think this product is best to be used with people with  wrinkles nd definitely in a long run before making an opinion,0.0

"As the mom of a toddler with little in the way of me-time or energy to spare, I was hoping this might be a miraculous one-step game changer for my dry, damaged skin. After using it for a week it does seem to have made a difference—my skin does look and feel more refreshed. The application process is quick and easy, and it doesn’t leave a filmy residue or have an overwhelming scent, which is certainly appreciated. That said, I have to think there are more reasonably priced options that can do almost as good a job at a facial refresh, if not fully as good a job. To be honest, even if it did an amazing job and nothing else held a candle to it, I don’t think I could justify spending over $100 on a beauty product. For better or worse, my face is just going to have to power through on drug store solutions.",0.0
I purchased this because I wanted to try something new since I’ve been using the first aid beauty weightless mineral tinted spf. This one absorbs fast and it doesn’t make me greasy or feel thick on my skin. But it does like a little too glowy for my taste.

"Love these! I had a bad breakout on my t-zone after using a mask that was not a match for my skin. After using these dots two nights in a row on large cysts, the most irritated ones are 80% smaller and the smaller ones were completely gone after the first night. They don’t irritate your skin at all like many salicylic and vitamin A products do. These are great, the results I saw were similar to using prescription Epiduo. the only reason I’m giving 4 stars is because they are pricey. If you have acneic skin and lots of pimples, using these regularly would be more expensive than using an acne serum or mask.",1.0
"I’ve purchased the light and the medium, do yourself a favour and get the dark. It’s significant better and very buildable.

"I’ve been using it for about half a year and it’s okay but not worth the price. I loved the smell and it left my skin feeling clean. One pump is way too much and it wastes a lot of product to the point of having to refill my bottle twice. I only used it twice a day and still it didn’t last long until I finally realized I could use half a pump and still get the same clean and foaming feeling. It’s probably best for people with oily skin since it can be stripping if you use an entire pump, but there are probably cheaper options to get the same results.",0.0
I really wonder about the hype & reviews on many products but this is a really disappointing purchase. The product is a strange texture that does not penetrate the skin well & can not be applied consistently. To top it off it gave me a mottled appearance.,0.0
"Ugh. I wanted to like this product so much but it fell so far below my expectations. Some background: I’ve recently begun getting facials that include products that have plum ingredients and I thought this would be able to offer something similar of an effect. The advertisement of plum was my main appeal to this product and I was intrigued to see that the ingredients listed three different types of plums and one of them happens to appear in a product I know is used on me when I do go get facials. Unfortunately, this ended up being nothing more than an overpriced Hyaluronic Acid (HA). So to be brutally honest, if you’re just purchasing this product to get the benefits of an HA then I would recommend a different brand because to pay this much I would expect this to be the most hydrating of formulas and to actually deliver on the “glow” that plum ingredients provide in other formulations, and it sadly does not. I have personally had better, longer lasting hydration from other HAs, as well as other products that include low percentages of HAs. But what’s most disappointing is that I  saw no noticeable glow, despite using this regularly for about ten days (I’ve since switched back to my 2% HA from The Ordinary). The packaging is very cute and the scent is all natural but this is so not worth $42.00.",0.0
I recently bought these drops after seeing them all over social media. I really like how natural it makes my tan look. Something to be careful with is that it can turn your hands orange really easily. I will definitely be purchasing these drops in the future.,1.0
This truly helped transform my skin. I’ve always struggled with acne and this has helped clear so much of the uneven texture and discoloration.

"I love Belif in general-- especially their moisture bomb. I got the deluxe sample size of this eye cream twice, having purchased both of Belif’s holiday kits this year. So I’ve used this eye cream several times in conjunction with the moisture bomb. While it’s ok, I would NEVER bother purchasing the full size of this. First of all, it will take me FOREVER just to get through both of my 5 ml sizes of this (as you only need the tiniest amount). Second of all, I can ONLY see this eye cream working on drier skin (like mine)... it is WAY too heavy for oily or even combo skin. Third of all, I don’t notice any difference in my eye area. It’s best to use at night, because while concealer goes over this nicely, it’s SO moisturizing that your makeup can smudge a bit during the day when using it. So over all, I will use up my sample sizes of this, but would not bother repurchasing, as this does NOTHING for my dark circles and not much at all for fine lines.",0.0
First few times I had a reaction! I almost gave up ok it but then decreased the amount and gave myself more time in between use. Now I love it! It’s a great addition to my regimen.,1.0
"Was NOT lightweight, it sat on my skin causing my pores to clog , I have normal skin and this made me look oily (not dewy)",0.0

The best. Hydrating and smooth and dewy. It’s a must have and well worth the money!,1.0
"So I was so excited to receive this from Influenster for free to try. I’ve been using it consistently for over a month now and the change in my skin is noticeable to say the least. My complexion is more even, skin is supple and smooth. I really enjoy this and the dewy glow it gives",1.0
After letting it dry for a few minutes it felt sticky and very shiny. It matted down with foundation. I didn’t see much difference with being poreless on my skin.,0.0
"This essence is very pricey and definitely a splurge item for me. I pour out about a quarter sized amount into my palms and rub them together and then pat it into my face, neck, décolletage. Its texture is very liquidy and runny like water. It makes my skin hydrated, plump, soft before my next steps in my routine. Are there other products at a cheaper price that could do the same thing? Yes. This is a luxurious item, packaging and all. It’s such an experience to use this whenever I’m doing my skincare routine. I think this product has the most of their trademarked Hadasei-3 ingredient, so I do think you’re getting quality ingredients for the price. Despite it being so expensive, it has lasted me for over half a year.",1.0
"Totally got this in the mail today from #influenster it’s Wishful’s Yo glow Enzyme  scrub from Huda. The scrub smells super good like pineapples and papaya, not a super strong smell but a light airy scent. I was so excited to try it out and of course I did as soon as I had the time. I applied it to my face and started to rub in a circular motion and dead skin instantly started coming off. I was amazed at how much there was and how fast the product started to work. After I rinsed my face, it was so smooth and glowy. I will definitely be purchasing this product, I have a feeling this is already a fav or mine!",1.0
Is extremely drying and did not make a difference in my skin. Made me break out more!,0.0
Love this! makes my skin super soft and plump when i wake up in the morning :) feels super hydrated!!,1.0
I’m very disappointed in this product. I have mildly sensitive skin but I felt good giving this cream a try. It has a good combination of ingredients that are usually nurturing to skin. However this stuff inflamed my skin and made it read and stinging. Definitely will not be using this again.,0.0
"I am still unsure of the need for this product. From the description it seemed to be a toner, but it doesn’t work great as a toner. I think it is an unnecessary step to my skin care routine.",0.0
"LOVE this new eye cream! It’s a thicker cream, which I love, and the formula felt very firming after I applied it. The smoothing effect was perfect for under my moisturizer and makeup. I felt like it doubled as a primer for my concealer. Without makeup, my undereye looked brighter from the slight luminescence of the cream. I received this complimentary from Influenster and I will definitely be putting this in my skincare vault for future use!",1.0

"I got this as a deluxe sample with a previous Sephora order. So the thing is, I had no idea what this brand was, only that it was being marketed as a “clean, organic“ brand and that this product was made with mushrooms (??).So with this mindset, I tried it and wow. It has a thicker, almost a liquid jelly if that makes sense but it is easy to spread on the face. I have sensitive skin but I have no gotten any allergic reactions to this (and I’ve gotten them to supposed sensitive skin focused brands such as Eucerin etc). Overall, I felt like it kept my skin hydrated throughout the night. Only con is the hefty price tag (hence the 4 stars and not 5). That being said, a little goes a long way so this will probably last a decently long time!",1.0
"Surprisingly this moisturizer helps keep my face hydrated. I didn’t think this would work but I wanted to try it anyways, plus it’s watermelon! Good thing I did! Its also a good primer because my make up stays on!",1.0
"I got the mini one in this to try it out and I’ll be repurchasing the large one. I have dry-sensitive skin that changes to combo-sensitive in the warmer months. I used it with a serum in the morning and skin feels plump and hydrated. I do use a little more than necessary, allow 5-10 mins to absorb and tissue off any excess. I’m recovering from a breakout from another moisturizer and I haven’t gotten any breakouts or bumps from this. I only use this during the morning only though. I don’t see it being able to go the distance for me as an overnight cream due to excessive dry areas. The price point is obviously an issue but if it works and doesn’t break me out then oh well. I just wish it was a little cheaper and that it came in an airtight jar.",1.0
I hate this sunscreen. It complete pills and makes you look totally patchy. Barely stays on your face. I love the “glowy” look so the shine didn’t bother me but when it’s literally melting off your face 2 seconds after you apply it what is the point?,0.0
So my skin feels really soft right now I used a quick masked and wiped it off after 10 minutes. It kind of burned when I put it on I have sensitive skin it smelled good but it’s cool but not the best for sensitive skin.,0.0
"Wasn’t a game changer. Felt a little overhyped. Wasn’t stripping and had a lighter thinner gel texture. Loved the pump and was good for everyday use. Foamed up well, but honestly wasn’t amazed or anything. Will use up but probably will try something else after.",0.0
"This cream is hardly moisturizing, I need to apply two layers to combat dry skin, and even after that it doesn’t feel like my skin absorbed the cream, rather its just sitting on top of my skin. Wouldn’t buy this again",0.0
"This is such a great gentle cleanser! The smell is great and it does a good job cleaning the skin without stripping it! This is the perfect morning cleanse or for days where you don’t wear much makeup or sweat. On days where I do, I prefer something that is a little deeper of a clean!",1.0
"I really love this peel, it literally does all the exfoliating for you. I have normally dryish skin and rarely get a pimple so I only really use this 1-2 times a week exfoliate and I love it.",1.0
"This product was complimentary from Sunday Riley but all opinions are my own. Let’s start of with I love this product. First the packaging is nice and sturdy. I love that it’s in a glass container, as for the product itself it’s really nice. It states that it instantly plumps the look of fine lines, I can’t say anything towards that since I don’t quite have them but it will be good for when I do. What I can tell you is that it let my face brighter. I had a pimple that was growing but the day after using it, the pimple was reduced. It might be due to the lactic acid and the other great exfoliants (prickly pear,agave,cactus) it wasn’t irritating at all and it was soothing a bit? , could have been the aloe in it. I love that in the ingredient list it has a high quality of exfoliants and nourishing things it has squalene too! I think it leaves your face smooth because of the dimethicone but I don’t mind that ingredient because it’s farther down the ingredient list so the percentage it has is lower. It was easy to use, love the pump! It absorbed quickly and it had a nice lemon scent like my lemon tree. If you don’t like or your skin is sensitive to scented skincare this might not be for you. I recommend this, although it is pricey, this is one skincare that matches its price due to the ingredients and how awesome it is. I still will continue to use to see if it can get rid of my hyperpigmentation, that will be the real test but for now I’m very satisfied with the product.",1.0
"I started using this with a lux sample, liked it so much that now I bought a full size. It’s been amazing at removing my chin acne scarring (I have olive skin).  It’s gentle but efficient. Can be used during the day or night (unlike some acids or retinol)",1.0
"Doesn’t smell very nice and it is also kind of heavy. Sits more on top rather than absorbing well. My normal skin tolerates it, but if you have oily skin it is probably too much.",0.0
"I’m giving this two starts because of the fantastic smell and the luxurious feeling it has when applied. It does not keep my lip hydrated whatsoever. This came highly recommended from a friend who suffers from frequent chappedLips. I’m not sure why it didn’t work for me, and my lips feel dryer after wear off than before. I don’t recommend.",0.0
"I really don’t get the craze for this. I found it to really irritate my skin, go quite red and the idea of rubbing it in after it was on was not even a consideration. Perhaps it was just my skin type but I found it quite harsh.",0.0
I love this stuff! I use it once a week and it really only take 2 drops so it lasts a long time. My skin always looks and feels so soft after I use this product.,1.0
"I really wanted to give this a 5 star. I see some results within the first week of use. However, the applicator is so frustrating to use. I’m at the last bit of it and the wand doesn’t reach the bottom of the bottle. I’ve left the bottle tilted overnight so I can get to the last of it; but alas...the product is too thick and won’t drip down. What a huge disappointment. I’m sad to say that I’ll never buy this again unless it is offered in a better applicator. I’m glad I bought only the mini.",0.0
The feel of this product is so luxurious.  It feels rich and extremely moisturizing. Not a strong scent but i prefer that when it comes to skin care products. The instructions tell you to take a little and warm it in your hands which helps it kinda melt before application. This alone makes it feel like high end products.  I am in love with the product and hurting on the price as it is very expensive.  I did receive this complimentary from La Mer.,1.0
"I will come edit my review after I’ve been testing it long enough. If you’re sensitive to smells, be careful of this one - it doesn’t have a floral scent, or sweet scent, or even an herbal scent. No. It smells like dirty underwear.",0.0

"This is a decent cleanser, it didn’t remove all of my makeup but my skin did feel super moisturized.",1.0
This cream is super hydrating for dry skin! It has a light texture but unfortunately is a bit too heavy for my combination/acne prone skin for everyday use. I do like it for after a peel or using the Babyfacial. I also love the packaging design—it’s great for keeping the product sanitary.,1.0
I love it because you can mix with all your creams and foundations.,1.0
I’ve used this for a few months now and love how soft it makes my skin! It really does work but my boyfriend pointed out that it smells like urine and it was something I never realized until he said it and now it really does smell like it every time I use it :( I still love this product but am unsure of why it smells like this,1.0
Bought because other reviews said it was good. Has nice gentle exfoliation but smells bad when even  mixed with just water.,0.0
"I noticed my skin getting bumpy, so figured I was overdoing it with AHA/BHA stuff. Then realized the bumps were all along the area I’d rub Tatcha in - on the upper bones of my cheek/under my eye. So, needless to say, I returned because $60 isn’t worth little bumps. I noticed other people experienced this too.",0.0
"This product definitely made my skin smoother and slightly brighter. My skin felt clean as well. After using it for a few months the acne on my face progressively got worse.  I think the formula was too aggressive for my skin and in return broke me out. I gave it 3 stars because it made my skin glow and feel clean, but was a no go for me.",0.0
"AMAZING. PERIOD. Hands down the best cleanser I’ve ever had. Non foaming, no scent, natural ingredients and takes one good pump to cleanse my face. For me I love that my skin feels hydrated after using it and I actually feel clean. Safe for sensitive skin which I have.",1.0
I’ve used these a few times and they work- not super fast but they work. The last time I used one on a blemish near my eye and when I removed the dot... there was a dark scar in the shape of the dot! This was worse than the blemish that I wanted it to remove. It has taken quite a while for that to go away but I would not use this again after that scarring incident.,0.0
"Let’s talk about the packing first, it’s so beautiful and pleasant to look at. The applicator fits perfectly under the eyes for easy and cooling application. The product itself has a thick yet very creamy consistency, it doesn’t leave any sticky or oily residue. I love the fact that this product is scent less because it’s perfect for sensitive under eye area. It has anti agin properties which I also love, I applied this overnight and woke up with smoother and brighter under eyes. This is a product worth recommending.",1.0
"So I love the scent and I was so excited to try this product I got for free for testing purposes but I was really disappointed. I have dry sensitive skin and I truly believe this dried it out more. I’ve tried it several times and I have been using chemical exfoliants for a while so my skin can handle a lot. However unlike my other exfoliants, this one actually makes my skin peel off in large chunks without brightening my skin. It is the weirdest reaction cause I was hoping for an amped up brightness that simply isn’t there. Save your money and buy Pixi Glow Tonic or Paula’s Choice AHAs. The two stars are for the packaging and the scent.",0.0
"Great cleaser for oily skin, but terrible packaging! You have to swirl the lid open, pour and swirl it back!How about a pump or flip-top cap?",1.0
"I bought this product for the occasional pimples I get, and I thought this would help me not to pop them. Now it takes like a few stickers to get rid of one pimple and even after that it doesn’t  drain out the gunk from the pimple when the head has appeared, which looks very unsightly. Which still lead me to popping them myself. That being said I think it does help with just making your blemish come to head, not completely disappearing on it’s own. If you have sensitive skin pass, because it does leave a red a circle where you apply the tack side. I’m still going to get it again because it helps compared to the cream spot treatments that wipe off.",1.0
This is the fourth one of these that I have repurchased. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and this has saved my face in the winter. It leaves a nice glow too.,1.0
I’ve only used this a handful of times but I am already in love with it. I am a full glam everyday kind of girl. This really helps me get off all my makeup and my waterproof mascara. It takes everything off with such ease and leaves my face feeling clean. My new holy grail makeup remover!,1.0
This product is incredible. I’ve always struggled with acne and my skin instantly feels soft after a week of use. My acne has also calmed down and I’m able to control it a lot better. I’ve restocked this product 3 times!,1.0
This is one of the best cleansers I’ve ever used.  It’s sensitive on my skin and leaves me feel refreshed.,1.0
"I got this product through Influenster to test out and to be honest it is great! I love that it is quick and easy and it doesn’t dry out your skin. The scent is very minimal and not over powering at all. The final results are great after using it for about a week. I notice that my skin is much more brighter and the appearing of dullness is almost non existent. one slight set back is that i notice my skin was a bit red afterwards, but it went away after 15 mins.",1.0
"I don’t mind this. It’s nice and rich and doesn’t break out my sensitive skin. My skin looked pretty good while using it, but nothing spectacular. It also leaves a greasy film on my skin. Not so horrible I wouldn’t use it, but I just don’t think this is worth the price.",1.0
"BEST CLEANSER I HAVE EVER USED! I have tried everything from SkinMedica to ZO Products to drugstore brand, this is by far the best product. I have very sensitive skin so I was worried about a new product, especially with a scent. This has cleared up my skin and helped it feel super freshing. I’ve used this product for a month now and my skin has never been this good. I started using the travel 1oz. size and still have 1/2 of the product left. This lasts forever and is a must in your skin care routine!",1.0
Not moisturizing enough. I have oily/sensitive/combination skin and it feels as if the cream just sits on the surface. My skin would get flaky and feel tight/itchy and shiny after an hour. Not worth the price tag.,0.0
Love this moisturizer. Great for oily skin. It feels similar to a gel moisturizer but feels very soothing and moisturizing without leaving my skin feeling oily. I’ll definitely continue to use this on a daily basis. I use it before applying makeup primer each day.,1.0
A must have! I keep it in my bag whenever I go out. It has a nice vanilla scent and I has a nice gloss appearance. The lip balm isn’t sticky and very hydrating!,1.0
LOVE this product. I use this as my moisturizer every morning  before applying my make-up. It’s so light and feels amazing. I have normal to dry skin and this product works wonders on my skin!,1.0

I️ really do love this. I️ mix this with my Estée Lauder advanced night repair serum and I️ wake up with such good skin. The more you keep it up the better your skin looks.,1.0
Based on reviews I thought I would love this product. Unfortunately I don’t see the hype. It is a very refreshing cool mist to the face. But I don’t notice any significant hydration for my dry skin. It does not set make up very well. I will not be purchasing this again   It basically feels like you were spraying plain water over your face and when it dries it is just gone.,0.0

Everyone’s experiences are different, this just wasn’t for me!",0.0

For the high price, I wouldn’t buy the full-size as there are plenty of quality skin care products on the market for less money.",0.0
"If you’re sensitive to smells or even think you’re sensitive to smells, avoid this at all cost. I only tried it once and the smell alone was enough to put me off trying it again.

I’ve used this for over a month now — the advertising claims 28 days to “crystal clear skin.” Unfortunately I break out every other day. At first I thought it was maskne until I got zits on my forehead and other exposed areas. The skin around it though? It’s actually bright! I so wanted to love this product but I can’t figure out how to get it to love my entire face. Will keep using up the entire $$$ bottle until it’s finished though.,0.0
This product does reduce bags under my eyes. my only complaint is that it sometimes leaves a flaky residue where I apply it.,0.0
"I’m really liking this eye cream! You can feel the caffeine in it when you rub it in, but it doesn’t bother me. It does help with the puffiness! It also has a glowy look to it to help with darkness. It looks gold, so when it’s absorbed you look hydrated and dewy! Perfect for the mornings. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead 5 is because I have only used it for a week now so I’m not sure if long term it will help with dark circles. I received this complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0

"This product held up to quite a bit of claims made by the brand about it. The texture and scent were both really nice, as the texture felt more like a honey/cream hybrid. I loved that this was an exfoliating facial that didn’t sting. I’ve tried others, and the pain that is involved really turns me off of them immediately. While the instructions say that you should take this off with a warm, damp wash cloth, i felt like that only worked if you don’t have facial hair. As someone with facial hair, I tried to use that technique and it was much harder to get off from my mustache area. However, I really liked this product overall. My skin feels tighter, it slightly shrunk my pores, but I don’t have a glow or hydration afterwards. So, overall I would purchase this product at a slightly lower price point, but right now at around $50 it feels a bit expensive. However, the amount of product you get (1.7 oz) is pretty standard, but a little goes a long way, so the longevity of the product is also a plus. Pro tip for those who are wanting to try this, the warmer your wash rag that you wipe away the product with, it can feel kinda like a hot towel massage at the same time as removing the product. It felt super stress relieving on my skin afterwards. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0
"I recieved a trial size of this product free from influenster but my thoughts and review are my own. So lets start by saying that I’m really not the biggest fan of  essence type skincare because I feel like you can get the same effect from a good moisturizer and/or serum. However, this product definitely seems useful in its ingredients and there’s also a type of enjoyment in applying something so luxe feeling, its an overall experience and a good one at that but is it actually useful and effective? Well that’s a tough one because skincare is not something That you can review on effectiveness after only one use but I can tell you that the ingredients are great, and its to have a very light natural scent if any and it definitely made my skin very very soft and plump feeling almost like it immediately gave my skin back the firmness I’ve lost from 30 years on this rollercoaster called life and more years than I’d like to admit spent partying and being awful to my body/ not caring what goes in and on to my skin (including years in the California sun without sunscreen) overall my first few experiences were great but I can’t speak on the longterm effectiveness.",1.0
"I get cystic acne on my cheeks sporadically which have become more frequent with mask usage so I got these to help. When I felt a cyst coming, I put one on in the morning after washing my face and kept it on underneath my mask all day. At night, I put on a new one before bed. After doing this for two days (and icing the area), the cyst never surfaced! I’m glad I found my new routine for dealing with acne and I already purchased a backup. Make sure you follow the instructions and use these on clean, dry skin or it won’t stick!",1.0
"I have been using this product for less than 2 weeks, so I’ve used it 3 times. It has already made a huge difference! I have always had redness, large pores and cystic acne. After one use the pimples were shrinking. And my pores were sooo smooth. Every use they get better. Try it.",1.0

"This product did make my skin softer and more moisturized the morning after I would apply it to my face. I personally couldn’t tell much of a difference between this formula and the original formula, but it did make my face feel like it had some type of very thin film on it in the morning, and I’m not saying that in a bad way.

"This is a very good exfoliator. The texture is about a 75% mix of super super fine grains and 25% larger grains. It felt nice massaging in and I left it on for under 3 mins, during that time I didn’t feel any stinging or tingling it was very comfortable. Rinsing off took longer than I’d prefer, I felt like I couldn’t get all the granules off my face but maybe that was an operator error lol. My skin afterwards felt amazing, very soft, very smooth. The glow was nothing to write home about but I had a very very subtle light sheen to my skin. For reference, my skin turns pretty red with chemical exfoliators and this combo chemical/physical exfoliator caused zero redness. I really enjoyed using it, it’s a great option for people who want to stick with clean skincare but if that’s not important to you there are other less expensive options out there that would give similar results.",1.0

I was hoping this wasn’t the cause, but I’ve used this product now on and off for several months and my breakouts always coincide with me using this.

"After reading quite a bit of favorable reviews on this product I decided to order it. The season changing from winter to spring had seriously dried my lips, flaking and peeling, which was a first so I needed something heavy handed to help remedy the dryness. For me this product did not work well as it claims to, the flaking and peeling still happened even after using this generously both day and night. The scent or “flavor“ is quite mild, it’s texture honestly reminded me of vaseline. Unfortunately would not recommend this product if you have very dry lips.",0.0

"Tbh I expected sooo much more from this product. I have normal/oily skin & I was looking for an intensely moisturizing cream to use at night since my oiliness is due to living in the desert (hydration at night is key to help combat oiliness in the skin with dry environments!). After reading all the great reviews I was willing to invest the money since I was *expecting* it to be the holy grail of deeply moisturizing creams. And honestly it’s just OK, didn’t do anything special for my skin in terms of ‘deep’ moisture and I feel like I’ve used better deep moisturizers in the past (that cost a fraction of what this costs) that have given me noticeably better moisturization results. The cream has a light, almost clay-like consistency that I think other people might like, but it was not what I was expecting/looking for in terms of results. Gave it 3 starts because 1. It’s not terrible, 2. it didn’t smell bad, and 3. the ingredients are really good. All in all I would not buy this again.",0.0
"This did nothing for my skin. This winter my skin had hardly been dry. As soon as I switched over to this brand my skin became unbelievably dry and flakey. I’m glad I only purchased the small bottle to try. Would not recommend, use your money elsewhere.",0.0

"I received this product through Influenster and was very excited to try. I have never used a Tatcha product but always wanted to and thought this was a great opportunity. I used this product mainly under my eyes, cheekbones and forehead. The areas I either wanted to accentuate or even out. Product glides on smooth but feels heavy and somewhat greasy when applied. It does rub in nicely. My sensitive skin handled it pretty well. I am unsure if I saw a difference after use or a difference while applying my makeup. Overall I think it being such a utility product hurts it. I wouldn’t apply to my entire face because that seems like a lot, and for the uses I would use it for I think this product is maybe a little more pricey than I would spend. Overall a good quality of product however I feel it misses the mark of being useful because it doesn’t seem to do really great for any of its uses, just even-keeled.",0.0
"Have tried to answer the question on this site three times, that someone asked if this was good for mature skin and each time they said to try again later!!!  Why?  Annoying!

Would not purchased another FAB product ever.",0.0

For years I’ve tried find the perfect cleanser for my sensitive skin but everything I tried either left my skin dry or would turn my face red or just didn’t work for me but after just the first time using tatcha the deep cleanse my skin was glowing and felt so soft and clean I have been recommending this to everyone I know and it is 100% worth the price,1.0
"Wanted to love this product because of my red skin. Turns an awful yellow color on my pale skin that doesn’t blend in and looks streaky. Pills up with my other skincare routine, and when used alone still looks awful on the skin. It did color correct some temporarily, but with no long term use. I use this for about a month before returning it. Terrible product.",0.0

"I mean .. I’ve been using this for a couple years. It’s great and makes your skin look good.... but so does using vitamin c/ferulic acid/vitamin e in the morning and BHA/AHA/Retinols/Peptides ... they make my skin look amazing and are scientifically proven. This toner is kind of a gimmick because it’s not proven to actually do anything beneath the skin, SK-11 only claims to moisturize. Anything that moisturizes the skin smooths lines and wrinkle so that’s an easy claim. If you can afford to add this to your skincare routine for the rest of your life and don’t care about Parabens being in this toner , I would definitely get this. Maybe with long term use it will do something but this isn’t a guarantee or proven. If I’m paying $200 for a skincare product, it needs to have scientifically proven results and evidence thy it works... not just a claim to make it sound good. I stopped using this for a few months and stuck to new ingredients I found out about like vitamin c and acids ... I stick to using non luxury brands even though I can afford it .. my skin has never looked better.",0.0

"I love how forgiving this product is on my dry skin. I suggest using cotton pads and micellar water to remove the bulk of your eye makeup first, then using this balm to remove what’s left of your eye makeup and additional full face. I like using this instead of makeup wipes as I just felt like it was so much less harsh. I rinse with a semi warm water and makeup eraser cloth, which is basically a microfiber cloth or a clean face cloth. I wouldn’t recommend reusing a face cloth after you cleanse your makeup, always use a new one.",1.0

Received this as a sample initially.  Could tell a difference in my skin tone within about a week.  It’s pricey so I purchased a different vitamin C moisturizer trying to find a more affordable replacement.  There is absolutely no substitute for this; it is AMAZING. I’m 50 and have very good skin with a little sun damage on my cheeks.  My skin is much more even and I can get away with less makeup.  I’m a C.E.O. fan!,1.0

"The peel pads are quite simply, amazing. Though my skin is somewhat normal/dry, it is used to having peels and exfoliants done. I use this system every day, except on days I use exfoliKate. After a month, my skin has cleared up, the uneven patches are even, and you can barely see my pores. I like to use this at night as part of my night time skincare routine, and it helps the other products I use absorb better. I’ve been a fan of Dr. Gross products for years, and his peels are the best there are!",1.0
"I would definitely recommend these! I have oily, acne prone skin with many acne scars so glycolic acid is one of my go to’s anyway. This product made my skin feel SO nice once I woke up in the morning and definitely made some of the older acne scars a little brighter, newer scars not so much but that does take some time. I am thinking about buying these, as I did receive them for a free sample but the price is a bit out of mu range.",1.0

"“I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Tatcha for testing purposes”. I’m a fan of Japanese Skincare, and Tatcha is one of my favorites. I have tried some of their products since the first time I saw them on the market. I love how this Tatcha product “The Essence” with watery texture works on my skin which gives my skin extra hydration. I pour Litle by little into my palm and rubbed gently, and then tap it into my face after toner, and I can feel that the essence absorbs quickly into my pores. I have combination skin, and this essence makes my skin look more radiant and plump after applying moisturizers. Also, it has the scent of slightly fermented rice, which I liked. I definitely will continue using this product and highly recommend this product to my friends and family, also to anyone who loves fermented rice skincare products.",1.0

"At first it seems outrageous to spend this much on cotton pads. There are so many cheaper options. However, I believe these are worth it. These are soft, smooth, and gentle on the skin. Cheaper alternatives I have used in the past have been rougher. I think that these are gentler on skin and help preserve my skins elasticity. Also I believe they prevent damage and micro tears in the skin. I would repurchase.",1.0
"I’ve been using it for a while and I’m not noticing any difference in my skin. It didn’t break me out, but it didn’t change my skin for the better either.

"This is the first review I have ever written for a product of any kind. I bought the Luna oil, the UFO oil, and Good Genes on a whim because they were on sale (20% off) through DermStore. I am in my early 20s and have just this past year began to struggle with heavy hormonal acne. I have never had problems before so it was a total shock to me. My cystic acne finally faded after trips to the dermatologist, but I still had *extreme* hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores, and discoloration on my cheeks. My dermatologist said it was a waiting game and that the discoloration would fade eventually. Anyway, I canceled my Curology subscription and ordered Sunday Riley. I love the clean, put-together look of the brand and the objective of each oil seemed to target the exact problems I was having. I was SO worried about changing my skincare routine after struggling for so long with my skin, but I am SO GLAD I DID! These are my new 3 holy grail products. My hyperpigmentation is basically gone in the 2 weeks I have been using Sunday Riley. I had a tiny purging period that lasted for about a week, but now my skin is luminous and glowy and soft. I NEVER thought I would be someone that had skin that I had so badly coveted but now thanks to Sunday Riley, I do! I will never go back. I’m an unsponsored sponsor of these products for life!",1.0

"All the Vitamin C products I have tried worked in that they brightened my skin and made it prettier,  but it was a matter of finding a formulation that didn’t “pill“ my other serums a problem I encountered with nearly every C- Serum I tried expect for one-PC’s Vitamin C. I probably use more serums than I should (4 a night) and when I add Vitamin C my other products would suddenly pill up into grimy little balls which was both uncomfortable and seem like a complete waste. I have tried using less of each product and even going down to only 3 serums but I still had pilling when I added any Vitamin C except one.   I had been using the PC’s  serum and I love the results and it didn’t pill,  but I felt it was over priced and it smells horrible.   So I tried several different products including this one by Sephora,  but they all caused my other serums to bead up on my face which felt bumpy and uncomfortable especially for sleep and I feared I was wasting my other serums.   So now I am using the Sephora C during the day under my makeup which it doesn’t disturb or pill, and I bought more PC’s for night time use.  At least this way I double the exposure.   The Sephora Collection C-serum has a great price point and it does smell better than the PC’s Vitamin C,  and it isn’t gritty like still other lotion vitamin C products I tried.  If you don’t use many other serums it might be the perfect product for you.",1.0

"It immediately pilled upon touching my skin — there was no time for it to have actually exfoliated anything.

"I’ve bought these strips a number of times, both from Sephora and directly from the Peace Out website. I like them so much that I’m writing my first-ever review for these (even though I’m a long-time VIB Rouge member!). The first time I tried them was because I have issues with the pores on my nose, and also have a nose ring (a stud), that I wear daily. Taking out the nose ring at night and using these strips once a week, if not a few times a week (when I can spend a little extra on skincare) makes a HUGE difference. These strips work better than any cleanser or serum on my nose. If I use them consistently for a few weeks, it’s a total game-changer. It’s the times when I go a few months without them that my nose suffers. So the more regularly you can use this product, the better, in my opinion. I also like using the rectangular strips on my forehead. I have bangs, so it feels great to get rid of excess oil due to having my hair on my face all day, too. Can’t recommend these enough! Give them a try, and you will not regret it!",1.0

"This sunscreen is a chemical + mineral hybrid. Things I like about include: it did not leave a white cast for my skintone, the texture is very lightweight, does not have a greasy finish, and gives my skin a nice glow. I was impressed by these aspects.  I like that it has a faint watermelon scent, a signature of Glow Recipe! It is almost the perfect sunscreen for me.  My concern with this sunscreen is I have to be very careful with application otherwise it will pill. I need to pat in the sunscreen in small amounts at a time. Too much rubbing motions caused this to pill on my skin. This also made reapplication during the day a bit tedious. That is my only con.",0.0

"This is honestly one of the best things I have ever bought for my lips. I was surprised to even see negative reviews from people, but I guess that just means everybody’s lips are different. Lips are skin and everyone skin is different. Ever since I delivered my baby, my lips have been extremely cracked and no product would work. I bought this because I’ve been eyeing it but just finally decided to buy it. I’m extremely happy that I bought it. In just one use a lot of the dead skin was gone and my lips were noticeably softer. I use it throughout the day and it’s been a game changer for me. A little bit goes a long way, I love this product and will always include it in my routine.",1.0
This and The Ordinary Moisturizer are the only 2 items I use on my skin twice a day.  I love that this gives an extra boost of hydration.  I used to have some awful dry patches and using this on damp skin with a thin layer of moisturizer overtop has been everything I needed to get rid of them.,1.0
Loved it at first as it does what it states. My target issue was 1. Textured skin on semi dry/Normal skin 2. Reducing the mild acne bumps (underneath skin) on chin areaPRO: Resurfaces your skin texture to a smoother skin. Finished 1 jar then bought the second. CON: leaves skin feeling a bit red & raw with a stinging sensation on my cheeks. Reduced the time by leaving it on less and doing more infrequently. I eventually found myself not doing it at all. Switching to Herbivore’s PRISM 20% AHA + 5% BHA Exfoliating Glow Facial to see if this would help with the texture of my skin in a more milder way. NOTE: color of the Tansy will change jar by jar. I store mine in a mini fridge which I mix the contents before using.,1.0
I found that this product severely dried out the skin around my eyes causing it to be noticeable with and without makeup and noticed no change in dark circles,0.0
I have sensitive skin and so i have to be careful what brands of chemical exfoliators i use because they can burn and irritate my skin causing more harm than good. Happy to report that not only did this not irritate my skin it worked so well. My skin looks so good!! Smooth and no dullness!! Its a little pricey so its definately a splurge item but definately worth it if you have the cash.,1.0
This serum is great for making your skin feel instantly revitalized and youthful and the results are clearly phenomenal.

"The application feels sooo nice under my eyes which makes it a nice self-care pre-bed routine. No scent to it, which I prefer for an under eye cream.

"Bought this because I always hear great stuff and I have combo skin so in the am I get oily and I needed something lightweight. I liked it at first but it did peel under my sunscreen if I put too must moisturizer on which is annoying, the smell is very fragrant so I hope you like it, it last a long time which is good.

"Ugh, petroleum jelly is the first ingredient, so it has that same sticky, heavy goop of basically every drugstore lip balm out there and is just as moisturizing as that $3 tube.

"I wanted to love this lip mask so badly, as I’m a big fan of other products from Laneige, but this missed the mark. The texture of this is pleasant with a nice scent, and it comes with a cute little applicator. However, it’s ultimately a glorified lip balm. My lips weren’t super dry or rough to begin with, so maybe for folks who are looking to repair their lips may feel differently, but I don’t feel like this product has made much of a difference for me. I’ll finish it but won’t be re-upping my supply.",0.0

"I have been using this facial cotton for at least the last 8 years and it is the one product I will never stop using. It is a bang for your buck since the cotton is softer and thicker than other brands. One would think the thicker material will absorb all the products before they reach your face, but that does not happen. Each bag comes with 165 sheets and if you were to use a maximum of two a day, that means about 4 bags will last you a year. I only use it at night (with a toner to make sure all makeup is removed) and I only need half of one each time. In other words, a bag lasts for about a year for me, which means I am only paying just over a dollar each month for the product. I will be devastated if the company decides to discontinue the product one day.",1.0
I love this product! It’s clears and calms my breakouts. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. Can’t recommend it enough!,1.0

"I’ve only used it twice, so I’m still testing. But so far so good. My skin feels smooth and clean without the tightness. My skin is semi sensitive and I fell asleep with it on and I didn’t have any redness or irritation. I was in the process of making my own charcoal mask so this came at the right time. I’ll continue to use it and then try the mousse after this sample is finished.",1.0
"I’ve been trying this for a month now. I cannot see much difference with this serum. It’s sticky but not bad. And I don’t know why my skin peels off after using it. I’ve dry skin which might be a concern. So, I wouldn’t recommend this for dry skin. It absorbs nicely sometimes and sometimes it doesn’t. But, when I use this with the ordinary moisturizer it seems okay. I’m also using the ordinary rosehip seed oil at night after this serum but likewise, my skin peels off. So it might not be good to use oil products after using this serum. I’ll try again for 1 month and see the results.  And see how’s that is going to work. If it works then I’ll come again to give it a 5 star if not I’m not buying it again.",0.0
"I have dry/dehydrated, sensitive skin that’s prone to hormonal breakouts; I also live in Canada (which certainly doesn’t help with dryness!). I’ve tried a LOT of night creams (e.g., Fresh Lotus Youth, Tacha the water cream, La Mer - just to name a few). Lala Retro was HANDS DOWN the best night cream I have ever used and has been my holy grail for the last 2-3 years. This is why it breaks my heart to say how disappointed I am with the new reformulation! Despite the addition of ceramides, the newer version is much less hydrating for my skin! I find that I have to use much more product and often need to layer marula oil on top to get the same level of hydration as the old Lala. I hate to say it, but I think I won’t be repurchasing anymore. If youre reading this Drunk Elephant - PLEASE bring back the old formulation!!!",0.0

"With quarantine keeping us indoors, I’ve had the chance to really focus on my skincare. Well my bf has observed my obsession and purchased this for me for xmas. I’m pretty picky with the products I put on my face but since he bought it, I decided to try it out. My go to lately has been the Biossance omega repair cream (which I LOVE) and right away I noticed how rich and creamier it was compared to Biossance. I live in the PNW So winters can get pretty cold so I love to layer my moisturizer pretty thick at night but this moisture PILLS. I first noticed it when I used it in the morning and layered my sunscreen on top. I go pretty light with moisturizer in the day so I figured I didn’t give it enough time to set before using my sunscreen. But a few days later during my nighttime routine, I gave myself a good 30mins after my serums and when applying it I immediately felt it pilling. I did notice people saying they press it on so I might try that otherwise I’m going to use it for my neck/décolletage area.I do LOVE the packaging. So innovating that the lid is magnetic!",0.0
"Unfortunately I wasn’t able to test longer than 2 days. This product has a heavy fragrance and ingredients that irritate my skin. The heavy smell also takes a very long time to fade and overall it wasn’t enjoyable the more it lingered around. After using it the first day I felt irritation and itching. I have oily and sensitive skin. So I stopped using it because I didn’t want to damage my skin further. I’m not new to active ingredients like AHA (I use them every other day), but I couldn’t find what percentage of AHA is in this formula. I hope that in the future they come out with a fragrance free line, because I am still interested in this brand. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",0.0
"I loved the immediate results, which were visibly exfoliated skin, and an initial glow, but just seconds later, while i was looking for my moisturizer, my skin dried out and became so tight and flaky, it was uncomfortable. I wish it worked for me, especially since the reviews were glowing!",0.0
"save your money!!! this is a HORRIBLE purchase for people with oily / combo skin. not sure about dry skin, but my face swelled and was irritatingly oily after putting a single drop. made me break out, and for $70?! just ridiculous. I love drunk elephant products but this one is a NO GO. get a serum instead - this face oil is so bad that i’m not even going to use it or give it to anyone. save your money, please!!",0.0
"I’ve heard great things about this so I really wanted to like it but it dried out my skin so badly it started to flake (I have oily combo skin btw). It took several days to repair the damage that two tiny drops of this made. I thought it was reacting with my cleanser but nope, I tried another cleanser and it did the same thing. I’m not any more sensitive than the average person (even if a product has fragrance my skin can take it). I think this product is either a hit or miss, and I’d suggest to stop using it as soon as your skin starts to react/flake, trust me it won’t get better over time.",0.0
"I like this, however I’m not sure I love the tingle. They say that’s how you know it’s working. I dont feel I’ve used it long enough to see results.",1.0
I wanted SOOO badly to love this product!  Desperate for a good moisturizer that won’t clog my pores!  The awesome girl at the store recommended it and I was really excited.  After about a week or two I got this painful flakey red rash in spots on my face.  I stopped all products and just used coconut oil for a while.  After a while I figured I was in the clear and started this again before any other product.  Rash came back in less than 2 days that time.  Seriously...it hurts!  It was even too late to take it back and tell them the issue.  On the hunt for a moisturizer again...and looking like a leper to boot...,0.0
"Like so many others, I ignored the comments about smell, wondering how bad it could really be. Well this smells like a combination of feet, dry ramen noodles, and vomit. It also felt super oily on my face and made my face look super greasy. I got a sample size with my points so luckily I didn’t pay for it, and I’m going to continue to use it up on my neck where I can’t smell it because I don’t like wasting product. But I’d never buy this.",0.0
very irritating to the eyes & had to stop using.  Product was very creamy & felt moisturizing once on but had to stop using due to irritation,0.0
"This is a lightweight gel that goes on smooth. It took a minute to absorb but my skin did feel noticeably soft and smoother. It’s loaded with natural oils, plant extracts and some acne combating ingredients like salicylic acid and Willowherb too. I can feel what they mean by matte as I’m used to the dewy look that other gel moisturizers give. It doesn’t feel as moisturizing but that could be because this is the first time I’ve tried a matte moisturizer. I appreciate that my skin doesn’t look oily or shiny after application but feel like this would be work best for oily skin types or in the summertime for combination skin types. You can use this moisturizer under makeup as well to provide a smooth canvas.",1.0
I can’t believe I’m just finding out about this!!!  Skin has instant glow and feels soft and supple.  I apply for my Tatcha Water Cream and combined...golden!!!! This is my new staple in my skincare routine.,1.0
"I am so disappointed… I went to repurchase this after using for about a year and this has been reformulated. It used to hydrate my skin and be enough for day or night. This definitely isn’t enough anymore for me after the new formula. I wish they would have just left it alone because now my dry skin is suffering more. I went the other day to Sephora and tried out the lotus cream and quickly returned it because my skin was still super dry. So went yesterday to pick this up because this is what I always used and to my surprise the same thing! Wow… now I have to find another moisturizer for day and night because this is no longer adequate for me. Very disappointed with fresh :( unfortunately I will be returning this first thing in the morning and might have to just go with my biossance omega cream, or my tatcha dewy skin.",0.0
I received this as a gift from Good Genes this All-In One Lactic Acid Treatmen was complimentary. So far I really like that this all in one treatment can be used as a boosting brighter or a light mask. I love the ingredients that are clinically tested such as aloe vera agave and radish root.,1.0
"I really like these! I have used the hydrocolloid bandages before but these are medicated with SA and tea tree oil. How I use them is after I extract a pimple, I’ll clean, zap with laser and then apply this bad boy. Overnight it sucks all the goo up. One even had the head on the bandage! Score! I got as a free sample in a play box but had to come order.",1.0
"i am 21 years old and wanted to try this to combat small fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. it absorbs quickly which is awesome, but it isn’t great for acne prone skin. this product gave me some crazy cystic acne and acne on my forehead, which i never have as my break outs usually stick to around my jaw area. i didn’t see any diminishing of my fine lines throughout the month i used this product, but maybe it would work for more dramatic fine lines or wrinkles. overall, i wouldnt buy this if youre in your 20s. i think it encourages growth of new cells at far too rapid of a pace for this age and ultimately can result in some crazy clogged pores.",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product but I just don’t like it. It goes on very greasy and while it does get ride of redness, it completely washed out my complexion. I look anemic with this on. It also rubs off extremely easily so you get beige smears on everything that touches your face.",0.0
"I loved this...up until it started smelling really off. I used it a few nights ago and noticed that it smelled a little sour-ish and maybe thought it was just me. And I just used it again and it definitely doesn’t smell like it did when I first started using it. Sadly, I will discontinue using it solely bc if it’s smell. It smells sour and nothing like the orange scent it once had.",0.0
"I got the berry one but it won’t update. Anyways this definitely looks glossy and nice, but it’s so drying when I get up. Sometimes it stays on through the night and my lips will look glossy in the morning but most of the time this products is so thick and messy and my lips react differently every time. Idk",0.0
"I rarely write reviews but came on here specifically to write a review about this product.  I live in Colorado and ski all winter so my lips are DRY and I usually suffer through the winter with cracked lips the entire time, despite applying all manner of lip product nonstop.  This has been a game changer for me and my family.  Even my husband uses it.  I like the watermelon flavor, it reminds me of Jolly Ranchers.  Pricey but I’ve used it every day all winter and predict this little vial will last 2 years, so it’s well worth it.",1.0
I think this is an amazing cleanser but I am giving it one star because of the ingredients. Polyethylene is the fifth ingredient listed and thats literally plastic. That should not be going back into the water systems and in the ocean. I would feel guilty every time i used it and it went down the drain. Definitely not enviornmentally clean!,0.0
This serum smells great! You can tell it is working as it has a tingling sensation upon application and leaves skin smooth.,1.0
"Very creamy, light weight, doesn’t clog and absorbed fast. Highly recommend for dry skin very hydrating cream.",1.0
can’t believe it I’ve been using this moisturizer for years on my very dry skin and it changed my life.. I just bought a new jar during the VIB sale and my skin instantly broke out and it took 2 weeks to clear. I read the reviewed and saw so many people explaining that the ingredient change broke out their skin and it’s really true. Now this is going to be a very expensive body moisturizer I will not put this on my face again… and need to find a new moisturizer,0.0
"Received a sample size to review from Influenster. Honestly, what is the point of this product? I found it did absolutely nothing but aggravate my skin. It’s extremely fragranced and made my cheeks red, but didn’t cause a reaction or anything like that. I don’t see the point of it and didn’t notice it do anything for my skin other than make my cheeks red.",0.0
I have really dry and sensitive skin and I’m really bummed this didn’t work for me. It broke me out overnight which is pretty uncommon for me. I also felt like I had to use a lot to get all of my mascara off (and I don’t wear much). It smells nice though.,0.0
"Very hydrating, feels nice on the skin and it’s affordable. All of the ordinary’s facial oils are a homerun in my opinion.",1.0

"I tried a sample of this cream, but was not thrilled. It seemed to just sit on the top of my skin instead of absorbing into my skin. Although the texture is very smooth and silky which feels nice.",0.0
"I got this as a sample years back and I loved the texture and feel of it. There really isn’t anything like it, save for snail mucin maybe. It has a gel like feel that isn’t sticky to the touch. You can feel the product absorbing into the skin, while also adding a protective layer of moisture. The packaging, though, is elegant but inefficient. The dropper is a hit or miss, sometimes it’ll pull up product and sometimes it won’t. Also, towards the end of use little bits of product collected in the corners and there was a wasted two or three drops there that could’ve otherwise been used. I also dislike that when using it I am constantly exposing the product to the air, which I fear may contaminate it. If you dislike fragrance or have a sensitivity from it this product isn’t for you. Although the scent is light I have heard people saying they’ve broken out from it, which I am assuming has to do with the scent since there really aren’t any other irritating ingredients in the formula.",0.0
I was really excited to try this Laneige product as everyone raves about it. Sadly it doesn’t work as well for my lips. I have much better results with other lip balms. The staying power is only a couple hours and I’m not too crazy with the sticky texture.,0.0
I honestly wasn’t impressed with this moisturizer - it was much thinner than I expected and felt almost oily when I put it on. I used it for a couple of weeks and it didn’t seem to noticeably improve my dry areas.,0.0
"I wanted to love this cleanser because it has some good pros ( removes most makeup, doesn’t feel drying, it’s gentle, lathers up nicely, fragrance free) HOWEVER it broke me out a little which caused some acne. I do have acne prone sensitive dry skin so my skin condition is very delicate. Overall it’s okay but not worth using for my skin because at least for me it causes acne.",0.0
"Great product, wonderful smell and texture. It really helps with dry patches and eczema. However, I do find it to be a little bit on the ticker side and it takes quite a bit of product to apply it to a normal sized region say the size of your palm. It seems to be very dense and therefore stay in the initial application zone. It also gets absorbed sort of quickly if you will so spreading it out from that initial spot is difficult. Kind of wish it were lighter that way I could use less on a given area.",1.0
"I really like this moisturizer! I received it complementary via Influenster but it works amazing when I have breakouts which has been happening a lot lately! It smells amazing, not too overpowering. It has a really nice consistency and looks great on my skin.",1.0
"I received this product through influencer and was given a week sample to try. Within the week I’ve not been able to see a really big change, but here are some things I can say I really like about it.1) it doesn’t have a strong fragrance which is great for my sensitive skin 2) it leaves the skin feeling soft rather than tacky.",1.0
"I have dry skin and I barely break out, but after using this product just one time, my skin broke out almost immediately. The product did moisturize my skin, so I kept using it, hoping that my breakouts would maybe go away, and that the moisturizer did not cause them. But as time went on, my face kept on getting worse and now I am scared of even putting the slightest amount of this product on my face. Very sad.",0.0

"A little goes a long way! Product is smooth, smells wonderful, quickly fixes dry skin and isn’t greasy.  It is a great night cream!",1.0
"Overall, this lip mask does the job well. It is very moisturizing and long lasting but I only recommend using it at night because it is so sticky. It has a slight berry smell that sadly disappears when applied. The packaging is nice and sturdy, which is a plus. This product is great, but I think that there are better balms on the market.",0.0
It has the typical tatcha scent even though it is supposed to be fragrance free. You can feel it tightening/plumping as soon as it is applied. I have been using for a week and a half twice per day and have seen a minimal difference as far as my wrinkles are concerned. Hoping after a longer period of time using I will see more results.,0.0
THIS IS JUST AMAZING! I bought this and I never thought that it would change my life. It keeps my face so clear of acne.,1.0
"This is a nice face mask. It smells lovely and I love how it feels. But it honestly doesn’t do much. I’ve used it many times and my face doesn’t feel any different after using it. I have dry skin, and after using, it feels just as dry as before. Not the ideal outcome when using an expensive face mask.",0.0
"Some days I hate this and some days I love it! It removes makeup well, I like the scent of it even though it’s fragrance free, it feels like a luxury cleansing balm (on its good days). But there are times where it is breaking apart and grainy/oily and it feels like an exfoliant on my skin. Very weird. Not sure how to feel about this lol",0.0
"This cleanser did not irritate my sensitive skin. It took of the remnants of makeup after I used a makeup remover wipe. It wasn’t drying. It didn’t have any effect on my skin negative or positive. I do not feel it achieved any kind of “deep cleanse”.  It was OK. I have other cleansers that do the same thing, at a much better cost. I’d use it, I just don’t see any reason to switch to it.",0.0
VERY hydrating- I have very oily skin and it helps a lot. I’m not producing as much oils anymore. The scent isn’t as over powering as he moisturizer but it’s still scented if that bothers you. I did receive this from Influenster-,1.0
"When I first used this product, my face was burning some parts of my sensitive spots. Then I found out that I’ve used too much and suppose to use a drop on each section of my face. And then after a couple weeks I didn’t see any results and my acne was bumming me down completely. Untillllll, this week (week 3) I could def see a difference in my skin texture is a lot smoother and I see the tiny bumps on my cheeks and forehead are going away. So far, I really like how this product works. I got before and after of my cheeks and forehead. But I def see a difference and will continue using it",1.0
"I love how this product feels on my skin ! My skin feels really dewy ! However, I don’t feel like my skin stays hydrated long enough… I have super sensitive and dry skin .

"I would love to give it a 5 star. Although it smells really good, but I think a nature mask shouldnt smell that strong. haha.

Not fan of the smell. Leaves my face with a heavy feeling like an odd greasiness when it dries. The only thing that I did like was the cool sensation when I applied it and it did remove dirt. But cannot deal with the smell and the heavy oily sticky feeling after it dries.,0.0
"I love it; it’s lightweight, not greasy or goopy at all, moisturizing and it works. I’m a runner in New Mexico, so I’m outside a lot, and the sun is intense and I need something that can take the heat and the sweat. I use it every day, mostly by itself. I love that it’s a “clean“ product - I don’t wear hardly any makeup, so it feels clean on my face, which I like.",1.0
"I’ve been using this a couple times a week for the past few months and I’ve seen a noticeable difference in how red my skin is. My skin is much more even overall. I don’t have any hyperpigmentation on my face so I can’t comment on that, but I do think it helps my acne heal faster. It’s hard to say for sure because other things like medication affect that too, but I’ve noticed acne is a lot less red and painful since I’ve been using this product. It will pill if I use it with the wrong moisturizer, so I usually use it at night with my nighttime moisturizer because that one does not cause pilling. Overall I’m super happy especially at the price!",1.0
"I’m not sure if it was the NYC summer or what but my otherwise normal/combination skin was struggling this summer - clogged pores, small random pimples, oiliness - despite my regular cleansing   exfoliating efforts. Turns out this cleanser was exactly what I needed. I use it 1-2 times a day and it completely cleared up my skin without drying it at any point. No more oil, much fewer pimples, if any. Pro-tip: I use mine with a small hand-sized Korean washcloth for added exfoliation. I just wet and massage into my face first then massage some into the damp cloth and work that into my skin in small circles, focusing specifically on my nose and chin areas.",1.0
"This is amazing. I have normal skin, but sometimes I get terrible pimples. This work perfectly with my skin. Would definitely but again",1.0
"I really love the scent of this product. It’s clean without being overpowering. And the cream once applied really makes my skin feel amazing but it doesn’t really make any difference in my visible pores in any way different to similar products at a lower price point. I think if you’re intending on paying this price for a pore minimizer, it’s a great one to choose but you’re not missing out on anything by buying a less expensive product.",1.0

"I tried to like it - I’ve used it for a few days but I’m currently on accutane and it severely dried out my skin even tho it’s supposed to do the opposite. I’m glad I read the comments because I thought my skin was peeling but this product just pills even tho I tapped it on my skin instead of rubbing it in. It felt nice, I did like the stickiness of it since I’m on accutane. The price is good but I wish it worked for me :( it doesn’t have any acne clogging ingredients as well. I will be returning this and I will not be recommending this to anyone.",0.0
"I liked the scent (very light) and packaging but my skin did not absorb this product at all. I wear glasses so this is a problem. Also, I broke out around my chin after using so I will not be using again. I would beware of using this if you have oily and/or sensitive skin.",0.0
"I so wanted to like this product...but it is too oily for me. My complexion is normal, and I thought this would be a new tool in my fight against age, but unfortunately it brought forth a couple of pimples. Not for me. Probably for a drier complexion that would be good, but I confess I don’t quite understand this craze with oils, even if they don’t break me out, they don’t seem to do much. Like argan, nothing at all, just unpleasant smell and texture and greasiness.",0.0

I am so in love with this eye cream! As soon as you open the jar it smells heavenly. It’s easy to apply and a little really goes a long way. It absorbs fast and leaves your eye area nice and hydrated. I was able to notice a difference within the first few days of using it. I am extremely happy with the difference I’m seeing and plan to use this as a staple in my routine.,1.0
Definitely a good product but a little bit thick! Perfect for at night to mix in with your nightly facial routine.,1.0
"I have acne-prone, combination skin.  I started double cleansing with this and have not had any breakouts since! And my skin feels more moisturized, too. I apply to a dry face and wipe off with a wet cloth, then follow with an acne cleanser. I still use another eye makeup remover as this doesn’t fully remove my mascara (and it will get oil on your contact lenses if you wear them). It would work to remove eye makeup in a pinch, but it’s not the easiest for me.  I tried a sample of the much more expensive Eve Lom cleanser and honestly like this one a lot better. The smaller size has lasted me more than a month, and I plan to repurchase the full-size version when I run out.",1.0
"I liked the feel of the cream but I don’t see a reduction in my dark circles like others did in 10 days.  There was a tingling under my eye but it was a refreshing one, not bothersome. On my 6th day my eyes burned slightly like it was in my eye and irritated but I didn’t get any in there. If the price point was a little lower I would buy and try for longer to see if it would do better long term.",0.0
"I was so looking forward to this primer after reading reviews and I’ve loved every other product I’ve tried from Tatcha but this was not for me.

I have dry skin and need a hydrating primer or foundation looks so bad on me.

If you’re not at all acne prone, I think it’s a wonderful product, but if you are prone to breakouts, definitely best to avoid.",0.0

"I would not recommend this to anyone! It never fully dries on my face. My face feels wet all day long. I can’t tell you how many brushes I have almost ruined after trying to apply powder to eliminate some of the shine from this and my brushes end up looking like an oil slick across them with all the bristles stuck together! Yuck!I’ve tried setting this with spray, powder, even tried the It Cosmetics airbrush compressed powder and that has zero coverage and makes the cc cream look insanely cakey! Adding this to my list of never to use again foundations! And it’s a long list. I have combo skin so finding the perfect foundation is nearly impossible. Also if you do end up trying this then order at least two shades lighter than what you think you’d need. I got the fair light shade, and it looks more like the medium color. I have fair skin but not porcelain color and the fair light makes me look orange. Also it turns the edges of my blonde hair an orange color which is really annoying.",0.0

#Clinique Smart Repair Clinical Repair #Inluenster I got this awesome product free to test and I am hooked. First off I I noticed how soft around my lips and eyes are so soft. Which one I’m excited about cause I have Scleroderma and this has been a help with me it has only been 3 days and I will continue use until all gone and will be buying more. There is no smell and my face did not break out and like I said for me this has been awesome for me. Love it and highly recommend it,1.0

"I don’t enjoy giving a less than stellar review but after using this product a few weeks I feel that the cleanser is very drying... like I’m using ivory soap to wash my face. The toner and Pitera essence don’t seem to make a difference or do anything for my uneven skin tone or fade my small scar. They could be water for all I know.

The moisturizer does smell pleasant.",0.0

"Excellent texture, gives long-lasting moisture for my very dry skin. I ignored the reviews about half-empty jars as I understand how selling by fluid oz works, but when people say it smells like feet, they’re right. It 100% smells like feet.

I’ve been using Sunday Riley C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum for a minimum of 4 weeks. I from wanted to make sure before writing my review that the serum would do as promised...and it certainly delivered. My skin is prone to hypigmentation which is annoying. Vitamin C formulation is just right. The spots on my face aren’t as noticeable and have  lightened. My face appears more even and has glow. I love her products and use this along with Good Genes.

"I bought this mainly out of hype, seeing it everywhere and thinking it was a cool idea. It’s EXTREMELY small, and for almost 40$, its not practical. The tint you get is extremely light and shimmery.

Bottom line your paying for name-brand and the packaging, not the product.",0.0
"Welcome to my Blog!For my very first post, I will be doing a first impressions review on Origins brand newOriginal Skin Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb. Influenster and Origins were generous enough to send me the new product to test along with a travel sized Rose Clay mask and Renewal Serum for a complete regimen!Matte Moisturizer 1.7 oz $34.00, Rose Clay Mask, and Renewal SerumI have combination skin that tends to lean more on the oily side with random dry patches around the corners of my mouth and nose. This makes it incredibly hard to find an everyday moisturizer that controls my oily skin without completely drying out the other areas of my skin. I was extremely excited when I saw that I was getting this VoxBox because I have tried a ton of different “matte“ moisturizers, only to be left disappointed.The moisturizer claims to leave “skin perfectly primed to go or better accept makeup.“ It is oil-free and formulated with “Pink Rock Rose and Willowherb“ to hydrate while also acting as a soft primer to blur pores and even out texture. That seems like a lot to ask of a moisturizer lol but we’ll see if it lives up to its claims.When I first opened it up I was extremely surprised to see that the consistency was almost gel like. The scent was a pleasant citrus with rose undertones.Close upNow for the application test. I applied a small amount to the back of my hand it spread out very nicely and absorbed fairly quickly leaving my skin SO SOFT! I was honestly in SHOCK! My skin looked as if I had applied a silicone primer without the slightly greasy feeling. It just felt like my skin, only better!I then applied it to my face and loved that a little went a LONG way! It spread evenly and absorbed right away. I swear my skin looked like I had just applied primer. I couldn’t believe it! I kept touching my cheeks, unable to believe how incredibly soft my skin was. It held up great when I applied my foundation and I saw a huge decrease in oiliness throu",1.0
"First off, I LOVE most of the Ole brand. My skincare is entirely this brand. But this toner. Makes. A. Big. Difference. I notice when I miss a day. Using this toner has seriously brightened my skin. When I miss a day, I get a white head. My skin is super sensitive. When I say sensitive, what I mean by that is- everything breaks me out - this doesn’t. When I don’t use this, I find that my breakouts return. This has become a staple and I will NOT go without it. Just make sure you moisturize otherwise you may find it to be drying. I have dry skin and I can use this morning and night.",1.0
"I love this product. Light weight, doesn’t leave a cast, and leaves your skin looking beautiful. I love that this product is for every skin tone also. It’s a great everyday product whether you’re staying home or on the go! I recommend this product for everyone.",1.0
It’s not often i find a product I like as much as SKINLONGEVITY LONG LIFE HERB SERUM by bareminerals. But thankfully the folks at #PINCHme were kind enough to send a sample of this softening serum. I typically use a rose and apricot oil serum but this poppy & herb blend is just what my skin was looking for. I barely needed to use face cream- and a little serum went a long way. The quarter sized sample could have lasted me 3 days but I could resist reapplying it! In that short amount of time my weird forehead breakout finally started to heal! I am thoroughly impressed by this bareminerals creation and I can see why so many others are too!,1.0
"Very visible difference since using this serum! My pores are smaller, I’m less oily but also my skin looks brighter?? My coworkers have complimented and said they’ve noticed a difference. There is a “purge period” but keep using and it passes. Works best when I’m keeping on top of cleansing morning and night. Obsessed, bought one for my boyfriend who uses it religiously now. And he has a condition that makes his skin VERY sensitive, this doesn’t bother him at all.",1.0

"I really enjoyed trying the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream. It was a lightweight moisturizer that left my skin feeling so soft and smooth. There is really not any fragrance to this product, so it’s great for sensitive skin. It also did not feel sticky or slimy on my skin, which made wearing it at night or throughout the day very comfortable. It really hydrated my skin, which made makeup application a breeze.",1.0
"I’ve used up two bottles of these, and there are better ones out there. It’s cheap and get’s the job done. It’s also great for people who have dry skin or may be sensitive. However, it’s a finicky product. If you live in a humid or hot climate, the product can be gloopy and melts a bit. With the packaging, I find that if I open it and I’m not careful, straight-up cleansing oil will drip out. This should come in a tub instead. Another reason I’m not a complete fan is because it can leave a slight residue on the skin. You would need to double cleanse with another cleanser. It’s good for what it is, but if I ran out, I would go to a different cleansing balm.",0.0
"I love this thing. I wake up with plumper-looking skin, my fine lines are less visible, my skin in clearer, and even my acne scars are fading. And though i thought it was pricy at first, I realized a little goes a long way and it should last for quite a while. Definitely recommend.",1.0
"Hands down the best overnight mask I’ve ever used. Every time I get adventurous and buy a different one I regret it (way prefer this to youth to the people superglow which smells great but isn’t as effective, also ew kind of gross to have to get it out with your finger). Keeps skin hydrated, gentle enough to use every night and on your eyes AND you’ll notice an immediate glow in the morning.",1.0

I wanted to like it. I really did. After being so disappointed with Tatchas lip mask I figured id give this one a try since people rave about them. I just don’t see what the hype is. I wake up & my lips feel dried out. Doesn’t really do much. Not for $20/$30.,0.0
"I did the very consumerist thing and added this to my order for $8 to save $6 on shipping. But good news: I actually very much like the product.I feel like I should address the smell. It’s not very strong, which I like, but it’s something. Not bad per se, but it’s a little bit artificial in a “body spray from Claire’s“ kind of a way, or in a “scented eraser from a Scholastic book fair“ kind of a way. It’s the sort of scent you’d expect from something made for kids or young teens. Some might love it, some might hate it, but it’s not overpowering by any means.Pros:- Moisturizing for my VERY dry lips- Clean ingredients- Light scent- Inexpensive as far as items sold at Sephora go- Not heavily pigmented- No unnecessary glitter or shimmer- The tin is very cute (even if packaging < the quality of the actual product)Cons:- Not cruelty free. I thought it was when I bought it, but that’s my bad. If I never buy this again, this is the primary reason why.- Application is a bit annoying compared to a stick shaped chapstick.- Won’t become my go-to",0.0

I’ve always been afraid of toners/tonics because I have sensitive skin and other toners have burned my skin. A Sephora employee recommended I try this in place of a Boscia weekly exfoliator I was using. I am in love with this!

I apply it in the morning right before my concealer and it literally makes my fine lines disappear. I have hereditary dark circles so I have to wear concealer. Typically it always settles into my fine lines but not when I use this stuff! It’s so good! I know that nothing will eliminate my dark circles, but this stuff definitely brightens the eye area and just gives it an overall nicer appearance.

I like this product and I can’t pin point why! The packaging is amazing! It’s a beautiful purple. Making it a stand out on my bathroom counter.

Let me start by saying I’ve never used an Essence or truly understand the need for it. I did think the packaging was beautiful and it made my skin feel soft and easily absorb my serums. I think it would take a long time for me to truly notice a difference. I don’t know if I could ever justify paying $99 for it-that steeps for an extra step in my routine. Note: I recieved this product complementary for reviewing purposes.,0.0
"I received the Ole Henriksen Lemonade Smoothing scrub. When using the scrub the after affect leaves my face feeling smooth, polished, fresh and soft. The scrub itself is calm and the scent is not like a harsh lemon smell. It’s a refreshing exfoliating scrub and it unclogs my pores making it easy for my moisturizer to absorb fully into my skin. Great product",1.0
"I want to start off that I am not a fan of watermelon at all whatsoever.  Disclaimer: I don’t like the taste, texture and I cannot stand the smell, it makes me nauseous. I LOVE this toner. I got this to review it and I was nervous. I thought I was going to have to put it on and try not to gag just to write this review. I was so wrong! When I opened it, It did not smell like watermelon at all so I was excited to try it. I had just started my accurate journey and my dermatologist told me that if it stung, to not use it. So I put it on and it was fine. The next day. My face looked soft. After one week, the difference was so obvious.  I continued to use it morning and night and I am so happy with it. One of the side effects of acne is skin peeling and my face doesn’t peel the way every one says it would. It is hydrated ALL the time. I wash my face, apply the tone and wait like 5-10 minutes and then apply moisturizer. I was worried that Eventually after longer use of accurate my face would eventually sting and its been two months and I am still using this toner religiously. My dermatologist looked at my skin after the first month and she was in shock when she saw how smooth my face looked. She said “one month eh?”.  Im not a doctor but if you have dry skin, I recommend GlowRecipe Pore-tight Toner.",1.0
I have been using this for a few weeks now! Love the easy application! My skin feels immediately hydrated and the formula is light! A must for any aging woman!,1.0
"i have moisture bomb cream and love it so I’d thought I’d give this a try. I’m in my mid 30s with dry skin, some fine lines but my main issue is looking dry throughout the day. This is light, very hydrating, thin under makeup and absorbs quickly. no complaints and there a significant improvement to how my under eyes looked during the day. For an eye cream you get a good amount of product and for what i feel is a reasonable price.",1.0
I received this product from #influesnster via #voxbox. I was super excited to try the product. After using it for the last week though I’m not as impressed as I thought I would be. The smell isn’t great and my skin doesn’t feel as clean or exfoliated as I thought it would. I probably wouldn’t buy again.,0.0

"Used as ‘prescribed’, left on overnight. I was surprised at how thick it felt. I put it on about an hour before bed, thinking that it would at some point absorb into the skin. When I woke up the next morning my face was still sticky with the mask. Very uncomfortable and way too thick for me. Since then, been using it as a 30-mins mask, and wash off instead of keeping on overnight. The effect is okay but I probably won’t buy again.",0.0
"I have oily skin and this cleanser made things worse. It leaves an oil on your skin when your rinsing it off and my face was shiny and oily 2 hours after washing my face. I also do NOT have acne prone skin and it made me breakout like crazy, probably because it clogged my pores so much.",0.0
I really like how it makes my skin feel fresh and clean but its hard to rinse off.,0.0
"I really like this mask. It makes my lips plumper and smooth.The smell is really good too, I even want to lick the product, lol. I’ve noticed some red/pink color in my lips as well.A little goes a long way.",1.0
Absolutely love this product! Removed fine lines in just a couple times using the product. Must have for every skin type. I have sensitive skin and it did not cause any issues. Love love love!,1.0
Does what it says. Definitely helps to sooth redness. Melts into skin. I can apply under makeup and it doesnt cake.,1.0
I received a sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. The travel size is super convenient. My makeup came off easily. I love the smell. It works gently and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It feels amazing on my skin. I love it!,1.0
"love everything this product is about. BUT... I do have a combination skin and during summer time I am more on the oily side. In the morning felt good, my skin felt super hydrated after the wash. But by the end of the day... it was soooooo oily. I’ll try it during winter which is when my skin is the driest. I have a feeling it will be perfect then.",1.0

"So I’m basically a pale sensitive ghost, just walking my dog I can feel the sun burning my skin. I’ve been on the hunt for the perfect sunscreen (which we all know doesn’t exist, let’s be real) one that’s lightweight, non greasey, leaves no white film, doesn’t cake with makeup, etc. THIS!!! this comes pretty darn close to perfect. Does all of the above while leaving your face feeling moisturized, not greasy. Which is a huge key for me. This will be my summer go too face sunscreen from now on! So happy I can hunting. 10/10.",1.0
A bit disappointing. I didn’t see any improvement on my skin after a few months of using it.,0.0
"I love this product. As a person with multiple chemical allergies and sensitivities, I am left out of most of the skincare landscape, which is becoming a problem as I age. This product causes no irritations or rashes and makes my skin glow. People I’ve known for years have been complimenting my complexion since I started using it. Yeah it smells--so what? The smell lasts for a second and disappears. I am extremely sensitive to smells, and I find it not a hindrance at all, especially not for its wonderful benefits.",1.0
"I have been using this product for about 8 months now and absolutely love it! In winter I was using it morning and night, but since it doesn’t have SPF I only use for night cream with the warmer weather. Love the luxurious formula and scent. .",1.0
I love that it takes off all my makeup especially my mascara SO EASILY! The scent is quite subtle and refreshing after a long day too. I wish the top was magnetized for the spatula so it would be easier to use but this is amazing nonetheless. Recommended this to all my friends and they love it too.,1.0
Recieved this as a Birthday gift.I used it for several weeks and saw no difference in my skin. Then I read that this brand was fined by The Federal Goverment for having staff members writing positive reviews! Will never by anything from this brand!! BUYER BEWARE!,0.0
My favorite sunscreen. So light and airy in texture. Feels like nothing on the skin and doesnt interfere with makeup application on top.,1.0
"I do feel better about not wearing makeup after using this product- my skin looks more even and glowing BUT this stuff smells TERRIBLE. My boyfriend asked that I don’t wear it to bed when he spends the night and even when I wear it when he’s not over, I feel like I smell like burning rubber- sometimes I can’t fall asleep because it’s so smelly.",0.0
"I typically don’t use physical exfoliants in favor of chemical ones, but this one is the best of both worlds! The cellulose fibers pill up as you rub your face providing a scrub similar to wiping your face with a soft cotton washcloth. I really liked how clean and bright my skin looked after washing with Yo Glow! I have acne prone skin and this didn’t cause any irritation or breakouts. This is a really nice weekly addition to my skincare routine. I received this product courtesy of Influenster and am so glad that I did.",1.0
This is Great one for the winter! I found it to be a bit much in the spring so I Switched to the Niamicide skin barrier one from this line and it’s incredible. Such a great line of products. If you have sensitive skin this line is the holy grail,1.0
"I do really like this product but since they are not entirely truthful about being cruelty free I am going to be looking for a replacement when I run out. Their products are vegan, and apparently used to never test on animals, but since they expanded to selling in mainland china which requires animal testing. However if that’s not something that bothers you I did notice great results and where I used to use lip balm all day rarely have to now.",0.0
"really wanted to love this but unfortunately it pilled up on my skin every time I used it! I’m about half way through the product and just trying to use it up so I don’t waste it. like many of the other reviews, it didn’t feel like it really hydrated my face much at all. if you’re looking for an amazing overnight mask as this claims to be, try out the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask! a much better product and about half the price!",0.0
"I get the occasional, multiple break-outs on my chin and neck due to hormonal acne. Rather than applying a layer of Clinique’s emergency gel from the chin down, now I can pin-point the pimples and destroy them without drying out the entire area. I think they’re a bit pricey (which is why I gave them 4 stars) but overall, a really good product for zapping zits.",1.0
"My skin is very sensitive, moisturizers and makeup removers make my skin burn and irritate. But when I tired this it made me skin so so so smooooth. I wanted to put it on all they time!! And it felt so good on my skin, I felt fresh, smooth and great. I recommend this for everyone!!!",1.0
"This isn’t for me. I have dry, sensitive skin, and I thought this would be the lifesaving holy grail moisturizer of my dreams. It has a nice texture and didn’t irritate my skin, but didn’t seem moisturizing enough. The 9 polypeptides didn’t seem to do much but sit on my skin. It wasn’t /bad/, but for the price, it seemed to do the same thing as an aveeno moisturizer or something else drugstore and underwhelming. I ended up returning it, too expensive to not really do anything for me.",0.0
"Smells nice, has a thick consistency, but leaves my face feeling greasy and cause some milia breakout.",0.0
"Amazing. Comparable or even better than my $50 products. However, it’s quite small but I guess that’s why it’s an “affordable” price point!Either way LOVE IT",1.0
"I have oily acne prone dehydrated skin, so it’s a lot of trial and error for my skincare regimen. I really wanted to love this so much, but it broke me out pretty bad. The packaging is nice and the consistency of the cream is okay, but I will be returning this product. Going to try Tatcha next.",0.0
So disappointing and WAXY. Essentially a tube version of a low quality cleansing balm. Doesn’t soften with water. Rinses poorly. REQUIRES removal with another product,0.0
"I had gotten this as a sample and loved it! However, when I bought the full size product, it has not done anything for my skin.",0.0
The. Best. Ever. I love this lip mask so much. I use it every night and I wake up with plump luscious lips. I love it so much I’ve bought the glowy lip balms as well. Laneige knows moisture. I want them all.,1.0
The #ToniqueComfort is made with honey & sweet almond extract to give skin a soft fresh feeling while it hydrates & purifies the skin. I did notice paraben in the ingredients though. It has a rose & honey type of scent. It’s rather strong but doesn’t bother me. The texture is on the thicker side. It absorbs into my skin quickly leaving a hydrated & smooth layer.,1.0
"I really liked this product. It’s unusual because it has a watery consistency and I’m used to a moisturizer so I was a bit nervous to use it. But after a few days, I saw that it seeps deeper into my skin and really gets under my pores to help moisturizer deeper than most topical softeners. I also felt that it helps rejuvenate skin and give more texture to my skin. I also noticed that it acted a bit like a toner making my skin appear more even and less red. I’ve been using the product for a few weeks now and although it’s definitely not an inexpensive product, it’s worth it. You sometimes need to pay top dollar for something that works and I feel this does work! I was given this for free but I would pay for it, if I wasn’t.",1.0
Great value. Only a little too oily for my liking.,1.0
"This is a great cleansing balm - definitely a fantastic affordable option for seasoned cleansing balm/oil users, or anyone wanting to try them out.  My only critique would be that it feels little grainy when you first smooth it on, and it takes a little longer to wash off than other similar products.  It also feels a bit heavier than the K-beauty cleansing balms I usually use.  That being said, this removes all of my makeup and SPF, even more stubborn mascaras, without harsh rubbing, and it emulsifies pretty well with a bit of water. I like that it is a balm in a squeezy tube, as it makes it much easier to use than traditional pot-style packaging. I like to keep this one in my shower to use after workouts, beach days, or if I decide to remove makeup in the shower.  Just be sure to use first thing before getting your hands and face wet, and follow up with a water-based cleanser :) Definitely a great value product, and I’ve gone through a couple of tubes, and would buy again! Also - I have oily-leaning, acne prone skin and am in my early 30s - this product does not cause me to break out.  I love and generally use K-beauty cleansing balms and oils, and am always on the hunt for similar, but more affordable and accessible products.",1.0
If you know anything about proper sunscreen application then you’d know this can only be used under a foundation that also contains SPF. Because of the silicone feeling in this sunscreen there is no way that someone is going to apply to right amount to get adequate coverage from this on its own because they would be an oily mess and acne prone skin would be at high risk for a breakout. Please don’t use this as a stand alone sunscreen thinking you’ll get decent coverage. You may not burn but you’re still risking sun damage.,0.0
This cream has been so amazing! It feels super smooth on my skin and hydrates very well! I usually don’t like heavy moisturizers but this one is very lightweight so it absorbed quickly into my skin! Highly recommended for this for someone looking for a lightweight moisturizer!,1.0
Doesn’t hydrate my lips personally. But smells and looks so good.,0.0
I received a sample sachet size of this product in exchange for a review with my honest opinion. The main things I like about this product and Clinique in general is the lack of fragrance - I never worry about having an adverse reaction to my skin. I used the serum in conjunction with the wrinkle cream from the same line but the 1ml sample was not enough to make me curious to buy. Clinique is a good bet for those with sensitive skin. I did not notice any difference in the moisture level of my skin when using this serum so I don’t think it’s worth the price. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct,0.0
"I have been using Burt’s Bees for years but wanted something more moisturizing and with a bit of shine. I have been using Laneige’s lip sleeping mask and love it so I gave this product a try for daytime use. I love it! My lips stay moisturized even after the product wears off and even if I forget to put it on the next day, my lips are still soft. Outstanding product.",1.0
"Honest review: RECOMMEND I tried using this product every night and I’m almost out of it. I think if I used this product every night, it’ll probably last me 2 1/2 to maybe 3 months. Pros: 1. Reduce blemishes the next day 2. Brightening and glowing skin overtime 3. Good moisturizer 4. Good for all skin types 5. Skin did not purge Cons: 1. Have to use a bit more product ( I have combo but more on the dry side)",1.0
I was able to try this for a week from Influenster. I didn’t really see any dramatic changes. I think it is very expensive without a lot of benefits. I like how it made my skin feel smooth but it didn’t do as much as I thought for the price.,0.0
I received this product as a free sample and I’m obsessed!!!! It’s helped even out my complexion dramatically! I also have dry skin and it’s really moisturizing without leaving me oily,1.0

"This made my oily skin super oily, sat on the skin, itched and caused a few breakouts. Listen, this isn’t terrible, but I would not use it again.",0.0
Got a bad breakout after use. Never using again. I never got so much pimple in my life. I would usually get one or two pimple on my forehead but never on my cheek and other areas on my face. After I started using this product I got a bad pimple break out.,0.0

"I received this complimentary in a VoxBox and I love this stuff! Nice little tingle to work, and it really feels like it has improved my skin overall. Will be keeping this in my repertoire of facial products for my wedding next year, my skin feels and looks so great!",1.0
I get breakouts all over my chin during that time of the month and excess sebum. I use the straight patch and put it on my chin and I have experienced way less breakouts. The patch seems to remove the excess sebum on my chin that create my breakouts. I have to say it’s a remarkable product. I use the other patch for my nose and it does the job of removing excess oil yet again. This patch does not remove blackheads in my opinion just the oil. So if your an oily girl you will love this. I hope Sephora will begin to carry the acne patches that this brand makes also. This is an honest review from an oily girl.,1.0
Love love love the texture of this cream - it’s rich but not too thick that you feel like your skin is suffocating. Keeps moisture locked in all day! Smell is very nice as well,1.0
I’ve been wanting to try this for so long and I’m so glad I did. I have combination skin that is pretty sensitive and mild acne but this makes it feel so fresh and bright! 100% would recommend!,0.0
Just got this in the mail about a week ago to test out and so far so good!! It makes me skin feel really clean and glowy without that tight feeling. I love skin care products with AHA’s and needed a good toner so this worked out perfectly! I would definitely purchase when I run out,1.0
"This product broke me out, I tried it a few months later and it still broke me out yet again. I really wanted to enjoy this product because I heard very good things about it but sadly it didn’t workout for me. Smells great though lol. Gave me red itchy bumps on my face and a lot of irritation.",0.0
"Too sticky, much prefer laneige lip balm. The smell and texture just wasn’t there for me",0.0
"I tried a sample of this moisturizer in the summer and loved it. It’s light, soft and velvet to touch, and brightens your skin instantly. I bought the actual product in the winter and I’m not a fan. Although it brightens my skin in the winter months, my skin felt overall very dry... I added an additional cream moisturizer as well to feel like my face was fully moistuized. For the price, I wouldn’t say it was truly worth it. I would recommend this products for someone who likes very light moisturuzing gels but otherwise maybe only as an addition to a moisturizer.",0.0
"Nice cleanser but I feel it would be better for younger, oilier skin. The pump and glass bottle is exceptionally attractive. It’s not a bad product, it just didn’t work for my older, sensitive skin.",1.0
"Gentle enough to use daily. I use it at night and it has a great pH. Affordable, value for money and effective.",1.0
"I received this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my opinion. I found the product to be overly scented. I don’t mind scented products but this one is intense. It’s more like a perfumed oil.  I followed the instructions and used a few drops, massaged in my palms, but I found that unless you had used another product before, so your skin was already hydrated, those drops didn’t go far. After repeated use, I can’t say that I saw much difference in my skin. Of course you have that initial glow from the oil, but otherwise nothing noteworthy. The packaging is beautiful and I like the idea of the dropper. I don’t think I would ever purchase though",0.0
I got a sample of this in my Sephora Play box and was so excited to try it. The second I put it on my skin it started itching. When I rinsed it off my skin was very red and itchy. It took almost 2 hours for the redness to go away and my skin got worse than it already was.I would definitely not ever try this again.,0.0
"Received a sample of this and followed the instructions carefully about only using a small amount once every few days. I tried it once and my skin became extremely sensitive (tender to the touch) and peeled like crazy, especially around my eyes - odd considering I didn’t apply it to the eye area. I tried again 3 weeks later and same reaction. Wouldn’t recommend. Use with caution. I tried to contact Drunk Elephant directly, but still no word from them.",0.0
"I had heard amazing things about this product from my friend who works in the industry, I am the first person to try anything new and that promotes glowing, moisturized skin. I splurged and got the kit with the Luna night oil, I love the night oil as it’s perfect for my dry winter skin, however Good Genes wasn’t my favorite product from Sunday Riley. I haven’t seen any dramatic difference yet on my skin this other than it being Moisturizing, but I honestly think the smell is a deal breaker for me not to purchase the full size.",0.0
"I saw a review that said you would look like a disco ball if you used this and they were right, it’s very shiny. I prefer a sunscreen you can wear on its own and this isn’t it for me. It does look better when I put on a finishing powder but I don’t want to have to do that everyday.",0.0
Love this! Great toner and the smell is really great,1.0
The product consistency and smell is very nice. What I didn’t like was that it made me look very shiny almost greasy wherever it was applied. Not good for everyday wear. Also it’s been 3 weeks of continued use night and day and I don’t think I’ve seen any improvement.,0.0
"This is luxurious oil cleanser! I use this as the first part of my double cleansing routine. I was terrified to use an oil because I have oily, sensitive acne prone skin. I don’t experience any issues with my skin having incorporated this cleanser in to my routine. This product feels amazing and does an incredible job removing my makeup (primer, foundation, concealer, powders, etc.). You need very little - I use a dime size and the smell is subtle. I really enjoy the process of removing my makeup because I get to use the Camellia oil cleanser. Disclaimer: I’m not a beauty influencer or employee of Tatcha or Sephora. I paid full price for this product with my own money and use it regularly.",1.0
"Was hesitant to use this at first bc my skin is quite sensitive, however I had no issues with this product and can wear it nightly. The texture is thick but super lightweight and hydrating. I also love how it’s in a tube. Obsessed with this eye cream!",1.0
Wonderful products! Used nightly to exfoliate my face and it’s helped keep my skin clear!,1.0
I don’t understand the hype about this over priced product. I feel like it moisturizes but that’s all. I see no difference in my skin after two weeks and it’s too expensive for what it does. Not a fan.,0.0
I wanted to love this product. Everyone raves about it and I really had high hopes. I would say this will maybe work for someone that doesn’t wear makeup. This pilled on top of my drunk elephant protini which I refuse to change. I have other spf products that don’t pill on top of my skincare. And I ended up having to completely remove my makeup and start over. I tend to use silicone/sweat/water resistant foundations and this primer was not it under my makeup. I will be giving mine to someone who wears water based products.,0.0
I’m new to the self tanner world I decided to give this one a try after reading the review. I’ve received and used it a couple of times and I’ve noticed no difference in my skin! So very disappointed! I’ve used the most recommended drops in my moisturizer and still nothing! I usually don’t return things but for the price point of this product I’m going to!,0.0
"i bought this to try a new sunscreen and it was just okay. for myself, i have a pretty extensive skincare routine and the way this product combined with my skincare at the end of my morning routine left little pieces of product around my face and as it “dried” it just looked like i had insanely dry and peeling skin. the texture is very silicone-like, similar texture to the pore perfect or benefit primer. i think it does it’s job alright, but really just didn’t combine well with my products (i use a lot of the ordinary in my routine). if you have a simple routine it may go alright with your products and i think it definitely has worked well as a primer, but as someone who doesn’t wear as much makeup, i think there are better sunscreen options out there!! really depends on what you’re looking for.3/5 because the product itself is pretty good, good primer and doesn’t leave a white cast, but thick silicone texture and didn’t sit well on my skin.",1.0
"This is my number one go to!!! It makes my skin so happy, hydrated and I received a bunch of complements on how healthy my skin looked!!!",1.0
I have tried a handful of this brands products and this one is a fail for me. I purchased this after reading mostly positive reviews. After using this for a few days I started to breakout and developed whiteheads which I never had before. Very disappointing because I love a few of their products which I continue to repurchase.,0.0
"This isn’t a great product for me as I have acne prone skin and produce a fair bit of oil. I think this is a product for those with sensitive skin and problems with dryness. I personally didn’t notice a toning difference but maybe if you can’t regularly use toner, it would be a better match.",0.0
I am surprised with the positive reviews and awards. this product is nothing extraordinary- it does the same job as a cheap drugstore lip balm - not worth paying so much for.The balm does work but the effect doesn’t even last beyond half an hour - whereas my Nivea lip balm lasts me for a good 3 hours at least. I’ve been a fan of the Laneige moisturiser but this product isn’t worth it.,0.0
I literally look forward to putting this on everyday! It feels like I’m adding vitamins directly to my face. It blends in perfectly and has helped reduce the dark spots. I pick at my face often and this has helped the scarring. My face looks even and bright. I don’t need to ever look for another serum. Love this stuff!,1.0
"Definitely feels very moisturizing and like that I don’t have to wipe it off after 15 minutes. However, it’s pretty expensive and I think it made me break out a bit the first time I used it. Probably not something I would buy again. I received this complimentary in exchange for reviewing.",0.0
"This product was okay. It didn’t necessarily absorb that well and felt a bit oily/thick on my skin. When I did wipe it off, my skin felt soft and cleansed; with most masks I seek the refreshed feeling and I didn’t so much get that. It almost felt like I couldn’t get it all off my skin.",0.0
"I received a deluxe sample of this balm, and find it very unpleasant to use. There is a slight oily smell, the texture isn’t very nice, and I find I have to use a large amount to get my eye makeup off. not my favorite makeup remover.",0.0
"When I got this product I thought “how good could a primer really be??” and now I can tell you. This felt absolutely weightless on my skin. Felt so incredibly smooth. I was having a horrible skin day when I tried this out and my makeup looked so nice after. It didn’t feel heavy or like my skin couldn’t breathe. My makeup lasted ALL day from a busy morning to the playground with my kid running around. I didn’t think I would love this as much as I do, but wow. Possibly best primer I’ve ever used.",1.0
"This product is amazing it contains so much product in the jar. This product works on smooth skin, if your skin is bumpy or peeling flaky it won’t look as good just like makeup. My face is so red but the color correcting covered it up really well and it looked very natural. It will look amazing as long as you moisturize right and exfoliate.",1.0
"I thought my skin was in a bad stage cuz I was getting texture and a lot of brake outs at first I was like there has to be something that I eating or missing then I read reviews about this stop using it and my face went back to normal , this was the reason my sling was getting crazy break outs all over my mouth and lip area!

I received this product complementary from Influenster and truly was impressed with how amazing this product is. It’s like a drink of fresh water for your face! If you suffer from dry skin then I highly recommend this product. It made my face feel instantly refreshed and soft.

Ladies this is a very nice lip scrub unfortunately I do believe it is too harsh for a facial scrub. Where did the Walnut scrub go? Omg let’s revive this perfect addition to our skin care routine!,0.0
I got this as a part of a set with 4 other minis. Disappointed. It’s not gel like at all it’s pretty watery if you ask me. This left a lot of residue on my skin that my cotton pad picked up after toning. Usually don’t have that problem after double cleansing with what I already use so stuck to using it only in the mornings. Also left my skin feeling very tight and dry... And felt some burning on my cheeks when toning I have an oily T but dry cheeks so I think this stuff just dried them too much after only 3 days of using it. I have discontinued use and once my cheeks feel normal again will continue to try the rest of the products. This is overhyped.,0.0
This product clumps up right away. It makes your makeup look so bad and it does not go on easily. Additionally it feels greasy on my face. Find another sunscreen,0.0
I have used this product a little over 2 weeks now and I love the product. I do feel like it tightens my skin and reduces pores. I also love how the product is vegan and sustainable because I want to start using more products that are environmentally friendly.,1.0

i received this complimentary from influenster to test out. And I am really in love with it. It smells like a freshly peeled orange and is light and hydrating. It almost feels like latering water on your skin. I recommend.,1.0
"There’s a reason why this cream is sought after. I’ve tried this cream from samples and now I am hooked.  The texture is rich but lightweight  on my skin. If I have to indulge or treat my self with high end skincare, I definitely will buy the ounce of this cream.  Complimentary from La mer",1.0
"The smell is ok, but it feels heavy on the skin. When I read “water cream” I was anticipating soemthing light, airy and refreshing but this feels like a heavier version of Olay moisturizer.",0.0
Love this cream! Very hydrating and moisturizing. Lightweight but still very moisturizing. I have very dry skin and find that this moisturizer helps incredibly. Definitely recommend!,1.0
Absolutely in love with this product! It has made my skin much more smooth and gave it a beautiful glow.,1.0
"I tried a sample of this product. I don’t have a big problem with pores except a little on my nose. After using this product for 7+ days I did notice less blackheads on my nose. It was drying but not too bad. if I had more of an issue with enlarged pores, I would consider purchasing.",1.0
"This is a nice sunscreen that leaves a silicone smooth finish. However, it can pill up really badly if you’re not careful. My mom tried it out and looked like her skin was peeling off when she put on her foundation. I’ve only had a few small problems, usually when I don’t give it enough time to dry and set. It lasts well throughout the day and hasn’t given my sensitive skin any problems",1.0
works well however extremely pricey for the quantity,1.0
"I received this product complimentary from Innisfree.  Having so much free time lately, I decided to try Innisfree Pore Clearing Clay Mask. As the mask was drying on my face, I could feel a nice cooling sensation. My face felt amazing after using this product. My skin was so smooth and soft and even the pores on my nose were less visible. It’s great to use a product that actually delivers! Great Clay Mask!",1.0
"Overall, I found that this product helped to brighten up my skin a bit after using it for a week. I will say, it probably isn’t for oily skin like mine because it is a bit heavy. Overall, I am sure it is the right product for the right skin type. I do like the results.",0.0
"Pros: airy texture, earthy scent (almost like fresh cut greens), 2oz of product is solid for the price point, absorbs QUICKCons: Even after the product sunk in, my skin felt like it still needed more hydration. Granted, I have extremely dry skin. I’d guess this work better for oily/combo skin types.",0.0
"Been using everyday for a month now and have to say that it just sits on your lips and does little to nothing to enhance the moisture content of your lips. I find myself reapplying more way more often than I normally would with my other lip balms, it’s almost like it’s drying out my lips! While the packaging is what initially intrigued me, it doesn’t allow you to get the bottom without digging it out with your finger. A classic tube would allow you to get the most of the product that you’re paying for. Glad I tried, wouldn’t buy again.",0.0
This product was gifted to me. I’ve tested this for the past two weeks and I’ve been loving it! The scent is light and refreshing and the overall texture is pretty light and great for the summer season. The consistency is really nice and doesn’t stick at all.,1.0
"Hard to apply, smells really strong and not in a pleasant way, did nothing to my skin, and its consistency is so runny that I had to be really careful to not get it into my eyes. Disappointed.",0.0
"I am in love with this cleansing oil. It removes dirt, impurities, and stubborn makeup while leaving skin feeling supple and smooth. It is easy to use, all you need is to apply a small amount to dry skin, gently massage over the face and eye area, rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. It’s also safe to use for removing eye makeup. The result is thoroughly cleansed and softened skin. Overall I loved it and would definitely repurchase it when I am out.",1.0
"Very irritating, stings and caused me to get very red and itchy. Would not recommend!",0.0
"I applied this product a few days prior to my time of the month, to see if it would help with the hormonal acne that usually comes up. It definitely helped with my acne! However, the product made my skin extremely sensitive for about a week. Moisturizer, makeup remover, and serums all slightly stung after application. I believe this product does exactly what it’s supposed to do, however it was too strong for my sensitive skin type. I recommend only applying a tiny amount, as not much is needed and the product will last a lot longer this way! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but the opinion is my own.",1.0
I’ve been trying to give this product a chance as I’m only on my 2nd week of using it but I’ve never had a product dry my skin out so much before this. I was excited to try it because of the hype and the ingredients but sadly I’m disappointed. I have combination skin but this definitely has brought out more dryness than usual.,0.0
Smelled nice but didn’t work well for me.,0.0
"This cream helped with the wrinkles and dryness around my eyes. In one week, I could see a slight difference in my under eye wrinkles. In two weeks, I could notice a difference in my under eye wrinkles. They weren’t as pronounced and deep as before I started using this cream. The cream is also very hydrating, a little goes a long way, which helped with some dryness I had around my eyes. Overall, I would recommend this eye cream.",1.0
"When I put on this sunscreen, it looks like I applied vaseline it’s that greasy. It takes about two hours to “dry down“ to the point that I can apply makeup over it. But it still looks greasy. I actually had someone ask what was wrong with my skin because it looked so greasy. It looked gross. I have combination/oily skin. This product is not for me. The smell is alright. They claim it is “scentless“ and I am sensitive to smells, but it isn’t bad per say.With the claim that it has “shine control“ I can’t stand behind that.",0.0
"Whenever my skin needs a pick me up, this is my go to. It truly does leave your face baby soft! It burns at first because of the acids, it becomes tacky, but once I wash it off I’m always as impressed as I was the first time. My skin is always brighter, smoother, and noticeably more hydrated. I will always recommend, hands down.",1.0
"This is my second time buying a full sized bottle . I wanted to make sure I was using it correctly . This exfoliation is too much for daily use , especially if you use toners and serums that will irritate the skin if coupled with it. I like to use it maybe once or twice a week now . The best thing about it is it makes your skin feel squeaky clean like a clay mask .",0.0
"While it is an okay exfoliant, the product clumps up immediately upon use which makes you feel like it is taking off a lot dead skin...but it isn’t. So, it feels like a misleading sensation. I didn’t notice any real different than using, for example, maybe Simple or other drugstore brands. I just feel like you should be getting more bang for your buck.",0.0
"This was like a thick paste when I first got it, and really hard to squeeze out. After about a month, it was easier to get out of the tube but it began to separate. So I would get a paste-like balm and liquid. It was incredibly messy and left my face with a greasy film. It also struggled to break down complex eye looks; like anything with liners and mascara.",0.0
"I had not heard of this product, but I tried it when I purchased the three piece holiday set (with the gold eye peels and hyaluronic mask). This exfoliator is awesome... I love how you apply it dry, and then the dead skin that you physically see come off your face is soooo satisfying. My skin feels so smooth after, and I have sensitive skin... I highly recommend!!",1.0
"I apply this lip mask at night and my lips feel emollient till next morning. It is a good occlusive, like a slightly less viscous, scented version of vaseline. However, once this lip mask is removed, my lips do not feel moisturized. I had high hopes because I love the face sleeping mask but this just feels like a more expensive vaseline.",0.0
"This feels so light weight and natural. Sinks in to skin so nicely and doesn’t leave a white cast. It’s a high spf but it doesn’t feel thick, and you can use it on face or body! It does smell sunscreen-y but i enjoy the scent as it always reminds me of summer.",1.0
"This product is amazing. i bought the small bottle, completely used it up, then bought a different brand as a cheaper replacement but it was NOWHERE NEAR as good as this. it’s hydrating, it soaks in nicely, it’s nice to acne-prone skin and evens out combo skin. this is seriously amazing stuff and i am so happy that i tried other brands out so i can tell you how much i missed this one.",1.0
"Best cream  I ever Used. I am 73 years old skin feels like silk ,LOVE every one of the products. all I use.",1.0
"I wondered why the texture was so nice and slippy and it’s because it has dimethicone in it ?? I didn’t think Clean at Sephora stuff had that, I’m not super weird about chemicals but I don’t like putting that in my face tbh. This is a nice sunscreen otherwise tho, feels good going on and plays well w makeup",0.0
"I’ve been using this product for 6 months. I haven’t noticed anything different with my skin, no glow, no lighting of acne scars etc. It has a watery consistency, it isn’t sticky, it feels ok on the skin, wear well under makeup and under other products. I wouldn’t purchase again.",0.0
"It’s a great moisturizer. I have oily skin, and it only takes the tiniest bit to cover my face. Smells kind of like Nivea, a nice change from the perfume-y scents that a lot of luxury creams have. Skin is moisturized the next morning without the grease that usually accompanies a thicker cream. Still not worth the price though, no moisturizer is.",0.0
"For someone who has combination skin, this cream is everything, its light on my skin and has a calming effect. Left my skin feeling hydrated and replenished....Dream Cream is what I’m calling it..Love it",1.0
"I tried the sample. Although the product does moisturize my face, it takes a long time for the stickiness to go away. It’s been over 5 hrs and my face is still sticky from it. It’s not absorbing into my skin. I like products that absorb well right away.",0.0
Contains caustic soda aka sodium hydroxide. I was so disappointed that this product contained lye definitely will not use it in my skincare regimen.,0.0
This was the least enjoyable cream I have ever used on my face. Did not feel hydrating at all. Waste of time. The Dewy cream is way better.,0.0
"So, unlike the SK-II SKINPOWER eye and facial creams that I received to try along with this essence, this product does not seem to have any added fragrance.  It has a very mild almost non-existent scent which is greatly appreciated.  To use the essence, I put a few splashes in my hand and then press it into my face, neck and the backs of my poor hands after cleansing.  I follow it by serums and moisturizers.  I did not experience any dryness, redness, or tingling.  I feel like my skin is hydrated, in good balance, with minimal acne.  I’ve only been using these products for a month, but I have enjoyed the way my skin has looked for the duration.  I will absolutely continue using this product and I would absolutely suggest it to those who have a larger budget and who are wanting to change up their routine.I received these complimentary from SK-II and Influenster in exchange for my honest feedback.",1.0

"This exfoliant sample gifted to me by Dermalogica left my face feeling so smooth, clean, and so so soft. It’s super foamy which I love! It starts off as a powder and you mix it with water, I thought that was so cool. I love this product and will definitely be buying more of it in the future!",1.0
"I have dealt with acne since puberty and adult acne for years.  I’ve been looking for something to help with stubborn acne. When I first started using this, my face did break out like other reviews said.  It seemed like my skin was purging.  After about three weeks, my skin is now clearer and my pores are less prominent.  My skin is clearer now than it has been in years. I plan on keeping up with this and buying a smaller travel size as well, so I am never without. Keep up with it for at least a month and every day as well, it’s worth it, in my opinion.",1.0
"This product from Caudalie looks beautiful! The pink to green ombre in the glass jar looks perfect on my nightstand. Besides brand reputation and looks, I unfortunately have to say I was very disappointed with the actual product and mist and would certainly not recommend. However I did buy online and didn’t get the chance to smell in person (honest mistake) but when I finally got to smell it in person it was quite honestly the most disgusting thing I ever smelled (personally). Not only did I spend $49 on this but for it so smell so strong and outrageous for a facial mist is absurd! If I had to describe the smell in any way it would a mint paradise and not in a good way. It smelled like a box of straight up altoid mints. This mist is extremely STRONG and not relaxing in any way. Unless you enjoy the smell of mints (and I mean enjoy!)  If you were thinking about it, I would definetly smell in person or if not possible get the smaller size.",0.0

"I received this toner as a complimentary product and am in love with it! Typically I don’t use anything to tone and am skeptical of products like this. However, after just 1 week of using it my face feels amazing! The product goes on effortlessly and smells amazing! It also remains slightly tacky at first so it would be great to use as a primer for your foundation! If you want a natural look I like to wear this by itself to smooth out the uneven tones on my skin like redness or dark circles. I would definitely recommend it is worth the price point to pay for a product that works!",1.0

"I read that using this on your scalp would help with flakes and it DOES! I spray this on scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes before rinsing. Right now I use it about twice a week. Once a week, I use Fable and Maine’s scalp treatment oil after and it’s a god send. If you have dry scalp or just want some good exfoliation you should try this",1.0
"This had no effect on my skin whatsoever. It was a waste of money. I like other tatcha products , but this is not good for me, Maybe the rave reviews are from really young people or others who are not used to quality vitamin C products. I have used various vitamin C products and know how the skin reacts to them in a positive way and this did nothing. For example PTR vitamin C and  SR CEO work well.",0.0
I was a little hesitant to try this. I was worried about how strong the orange scent is. But it actually isnt bad. For me I feel it does smell like oranges but not such a extreme scent that it leaves you feeling like you rubbed oranges all over you face. It left my face feeling very soft and perfectly moisturized. It didn’t leave my face feeling greasy. Would definitely recommend,1.0

I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I have been using this product for a week and I am pleasantly surprised. I have been experiencing very dry skin and when I first applied this product I thought since it was not very thick it would not work for me. Well I was wrong. My face was very moisturized without that greasy feeling or look. The scent of the product reminds me of a green smoothie however it fades away very quickly. I have been wearing under my makeup and I have not experienced any clogged pores or an extremely shiny T-zone.,1.0

I’m not sure how I feel about this product. It feels thick but spreads on your face decently. I don’t have a lot of redness so I can’t speak for the color correcting. It does start and green and blend in though!I received this product complimentary within the body of your review.,0.0

I can’t think of anything negative to say about this cream. My wife also lives it. I highly recommend it.",1.0
I was gifted by Sunday Riley for my honest review! This was my first Sunday Riley product ever! I have only used this serum a couple of times and I have seen a difference already! My skin texture looks so much better and I can already see old dead skin peeling! My dry patchy problem areas are smooth and my skin looks bright!,1.0
"I really Love this product. I highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a thin yet moisturizing product. I myself have combination skin so it’s hard to find moisturizers that don’t make me oily but also help with dryness. The phobia of this product I’m in love with, it left my skin not oily but also very moisturized. This product Has to be my favorite and I’m definitely going to buy it again. Are use the moisturizer before my normal make up routine, and it held in strength and moisture throughout. My sensitive skin usually react negatively to most products but it didn’t with this one. I recommend this product for all skin types it is now my favorite.",1.0

After 2 days of using this I broke out into a horrible red rash on my face and neck! I’m not sure why it took some time to show up...it may be that in very small amounts it was not irritating but it came to be too much for my sensitive skin. It’s a shame because I really wanted to love this. Perhaps it’s because this is loaded with perfumes. Not good for sensitive skin. And not good for skin in general honestly!,0.0
This smells so good! Like a spa product. A little goes a long way and it hydrates and diminishes redness. Feels creamy and hydrating. Spf is a plus! I feel very confident wearing this because it gives me a natural no makeup look.,1.0
"Honestly, I was extremly excited to try this product because I’ve heard and seen many positive reviews of this product. I have a normal to dry skin combination and this product was not for me. I gave it a try for a while but I would wake up with a lot of redness and pimples on my face, this hasn’t happened with any other product I’ve used before. There’s something in this that’s not made for sensitive skin. The texture is a little weird, sort of like jelly, and it leaves your face feeling sticky, heavy, and a little greasy. It seems like a light formula but it’s not. Maybe this product is made for another skin type. I don’t recommend for everyone!!!!!!!!!",0.0
"My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and I’ve been using this as the final step in my nighttime routine to seal in moisture. It makes my skin feel soft and plump, and I wake up in the morning with my skin still looking good. Was worried that it would smell weird but it has no smell at all. I purchased the small size to see if I liked it enough to buy the full size but I’m not sure it’s 100% worth the price point.",1.0

I chose this for my birthday gift this year and after using it a couple times I realized I had bumps coming up under my skin.

"I received this cleanser for my birthday and at first I didn’t care much for the light scent, it reminded me of a spice of sorts.  I am sensitive to strong smells in products, my eyes will burn and become red, my skin will become irritated but I had no problem with this light scent.  I tried it and fell in love with this amazing product!  My skin is dry to normal, sensitive and will break out if moisturizers or makeup are too heavy. My skin feels so soothed, soft and smooth after using it, as if I had applied a moisturizer already.  I have noticed my fine lines are lighter and I love how young this makes me look.  I have even decided I kind of like the scent now. I bought more for myself and plan to buy some for my mom and sister-in-law for Christmas.",1.0

"Been using this cream daily since Feb 2022. I have dry, sensitive acne rosacea skin and this really helped to keep my skin moisturized and it doesn’t burn or irritate my skin unlike the avocado recovery serum and watermelon moisturizer from Glow Recipe (still test with a small amount if you’re trying for the first time and have rosacea/sensitive skin and maybe avoid during active flares since there’s a bit of fragrance). A little goes a long way and it spreads pretty nicely, so it’s not horrible for the price if you get the refill pods. I probably would not recommend this if you have oily skin since it might feel a little heavy, but for dry skin it feels silky smooth and not greasy.",1.0

I was very skeptical of this at first and only bought it because I had a gift card (would not normally spend $36 on a tiny bottle lol). It has a weird smell and I don’t love the way it feels on my skin at first but I do love the way it looks. I only use it when I’m leaving the house (need to conserve) and after applying it I feel like I don’t even really need to put on makeup. It really is glowy. It’s also good for using under your makeup routine. I have acne prone combination skin and I’m still trying to figure out if it makes me breakout. I will miss it when it’s gone but it is definitely overpriced. Would give 3.5 stars.,1.0
"If anyone is hesitant about whether to purchase this, definitely don’t be! This is by far THE most soothing and wonderful smelling overnight mask I have ever used. My face seriously feels unbelievably soft and hydrated. I can’t wait to use this every night, especially during this dry winter season!",1.0
"I read many good reviews about this product, however, it did nothing for me. Just like rubbing any oil on your skin.",0.0
I admit I fell for the Drunk Elephant hype. I am 42 with typically normal skin except during winter when dryness becomes a factor. I used the entire line for 4 months. This product actually lasted longer than the moisturizers. I used it in conjunction with the C-Firma and then followed with a moisturizer every morning. It does well wear under makeup but in my humble opinion is not a stand alone product.,0.0
WOW! Just woke up from my first night using this and I am so impressed. When you take it off it isn’t like the traditional pore strips where you will see little white heads so at first I was slightly underwhelmed. But then I checked my mirror and my poors on my nose (which I struggle with) are significantly smaller. I have tried a lot of stuff like this and have never seen anything work this well. Will definitely be buying again!!,1.0
This lip balm  provides a full and glossy look to your lips. I like to wear it alone or under a liquid lipstick. You can also use it under the eyes and it doesn’t feel filmy or greasy on the skin. This is probably my favorite purchase.,1.0
This mask disappointed me. Not enough moisture fir my combo skin. I want to apply more moisturizer right after application.,0.0
I love this Vitamin Enriched Face Base. I use it as a moisturizer and primer for my makeup. My skin looks so hydrated & plump. Makeup lasts all day and dont look cakey. I love how lightweight it is and the light citrus scent.,1.0
"My lips went from cracked and bumpy (I couldn’t wear lipstick without it looking like the Grand Canyon) to smooth and soft. I can even wear a matte lipstick now!

"I have been using Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant for over 2 years. I have oily/combination skin and use the product 2-3 times per week and I alternate between morning and evening. Make sure to use SPF for morning regimen. My skin always feels smooth and non-irritating after use. The product is fine milled and it does not cause scarring which is always a bonus. I activate with water and massage it in for 60 seconds, and sometimes I leave it on as a mask for up to 5 minutes. I also use this right after using the Dermalogica special cleansing gel, or sometimes combining the two! (Tip from Jackie Aina). I also love how it leaves my skin radiant. This is a staple in my skincare regimen! You will not be disappointed at all!",1.0
Not effective.  My skin felt moisturized for maybe a couple of hours but that was all.,0.0
"Because I like the actual product I gave it two stars even tho the packaging got me wanting to give it zero stars. I can’t wait for this bottle to be out of my life. I don’t want to throw it away or squeeze into another friendlier bottle. How did the team at tatcha miss this? Having to squeeze really hard a pretty solid bottle, then all the writing on it comes off and gets all over your hands... you have to shake upside down for it to go all the way down before you squeeze ever so slightly so the whole thing doesn’t dump off. Ugh. Please let me know when the packaging changes, before then, NEVER again",0.0
"Heard many rave reviews for this product, but this really broke me out. Beware if you have skin sensitivities!",0.0
I have been using this lotion since May 2017 and can honestly say that it’s completely changed my skin in a positive way. My skin was super oily and I’d break out all the time because I’d try to had my breakouts with make up. I use this lotion in the morning and it hydrates my skin to the point that I’m no longer producing excess oils and I live in Texas! I’ve been able to stop wearing make up and let my natural skin breathe. This is a must have staple in my skin care routine.,1.0
"I wanted so badly to like this product after all the rave reviews, but even though this product did hydrate my skin, it gave me a painful breakout. Those with sensitive skin, proceed with caution.",0.0
This toner works great but I am not a fan of the smell. If you can get past that it’s an awesome product. My face felt hydrated and gave me a noticeable glow.,1.0
"I really liked this for exfoliation. It is a little rough on skin so if you have sensitive skin, I would not use this product to take off your make up, especially your eye make up. I used a cleansing oil for make up removal and used this product for my 2nd cleanser. I did receive this product from Influenster for my honest review.",0.0
My skin is still dry when I use this product. For the price I was expecting better results. My skin was still dull not much of a difference.,0.0
"This product is just awful! I have no idea why it gets such a great rating, but my skin is combo for refernce. 1)The oil goes on (my dry face) and it just stays there. You can’t swirl any of it around. Once it hits your face it’s staying there! 2) When I try to rub it, it created a weird friction on my face that probably could give me premature wrinkles. 3) it takes at lease 5 pumps to get my makeup off. ( I wear Double wear) so I have to do that twice to get it all off, and that just makes my face really dry. I just think that this product isn’t worth the hassle because it was poorly marketed. A drug store micellar water preforms better than this. I’ll be returning it since I couldn’t use it as a brush cleanser, because the oil and friction makes my brush shed.",0.0
"I love DE, and have at LEAST half of their products. But this, was a disappointment. Idk if I got a bad batch or something but mine was CHUNKY and super thick. It left me having a horrible whiteish glow that made me look like a scary monster. I didn’t even want to mount my makeup on over it so i took it off. I definitely will not be purchasing this product again and would not recommend it to anyone",0.0
"This has been a staple in my mother’s routine for quite some time. The company has made some nice adjustments to its formulation but that mainly focuses on hydration. The serum lacks some of the more effective ingredients that target aging. While the serum leaves skin plump and hydrated, I wouldn’t call it “anti-aging”. I think there are cheaper serums on the market that will give you similar results.",0.0

It instantly makes my lips feel soothed and moisturized without making them feel sticky or like I’m wearing something. Highly recommend.,1.0
"Yes, this does the job. It removes make-up and cleanses my skin. However, this is a little drying on my face; it leaves me with a tight feeling. I prefer to use my cleanser from the drugstore, the ceraVe hydrating cleanser. No tight feeling with that and it’s much cheaper!",0.0

"I don’t struggle with dark circles as much as I do eye puffiness in the mornings. This cream does have a hint of yellow which I think does help hide the dark circles but doesn’t fully make them disappear. It has a silky texture that glides on easily and does help with the eye bagginess but doesn’t make it completely go away. While this isn’t a miracle in a jar eye cream (I’ve yet to find one that exists), this definitely helps and I see better results compared to other eye creams I’ve used.",1.0
Highly DO NOT recommend! Broke me out so much as well as my little brother (who literally never breaks out) we both started breaking out and couldn’t figure out why. Then as we went through our skin routines we saw the only new thing was this cleanser! So not worth the $30+ I’m sooo upset my skin was doing sooo good till this cleanser! DO NOT BUY!,0.0

"Just finished my second bottle.. not quite sure that it’s doing anything as my eye cream is also brightening/de-puffing, but my dark circles look marginally better at best, after 6+ months of use. The one thing I really dislike about this is that the product builds up around rim of bottle and oxides into this very gross, thick crust that reminds me of foam housing insulation. This has happened on both bottles, even though I’m careful not to get product everywhere.",0.0
"This eye cream is beautiful. From the packaging to the actual cream, it is luxurious throughout. The cream is really think so I would only use it during nights and when you are not using makeup, because it might make your concealer slip during oily days. It does have a slight but pleasant smell. If you are allergic to fragrance, you might not like it! Moisturizes without milia. Can’t say a lot about the wrinkle smoothing since I haven’t used it for that long, hence knocked off 1 star. Also it doesn’t claim to, nor does help with dark circles. Thanks to Influenster for letting me try this out for free in exchange of an honest review!",1.0

"I have used prescription retinol before and this is even better with less irritation.  I’ve seen results in 1-2 months.  To the people who aren’t seeing results, I’m wondering if you need to get to the point where you use it alone rather than with a moisturizer.  I’ve seen the best results once I applied it every night before moisturizer.  But you should start it with a moisturizer.   It does exactly what retinol is supposed to do.",1.0
I’m so used to lather like foam or exfoliating cleansers that it’s been challenging for me to accept that my face is being clean using this and the feeling is so different leaving my face soft and not dry and right. Just recently got into this brand the price is amazing and being gluten free is even better. I will try other products to see if they help my skin. This cleanser is good and seems to clean the skin thoroughly.,1.0

"I am no stranger to double cleansing so I was really excited to try this, especially after my mom said it’s one of her favorite products! It felt like it got the job done with removing my makeup.

That alone is typically a dealbreaker for me, and I will say that I don’t typically have sensitive eyes. I also was not a big fan of the smell.

"This moisturizer...confuses me. It does not claim to be oil free, non-comedogenic, or dermatologist tested which are the very first things I look for in any category of skincare before I ever even consider putting something on my face. When I looked at the ingredient list, I found it does contain Passion flower seed oil, which upon my research has a fairly low likelihood of clogging pores. HOWEVER this product also contains olive oil which is a pore clogging oil, so all of my acne prone babes beware. I also have to point out that this product claims to contain probiotics (live bacteria) however this product contains preservatives like tocopherol acetate (a vitamin E derivative). What you need to understand is that preservatives kill live bacteria rendering the “probiotics” useless. Which leaves me very confused as to what this product is trying to accomplish. I do enjoy the cooling sensation of this product it’s quite nice and I find that it lasts for a decent amount of time. You may enjoy this product if you aren’t sensitive or acne prone and prefer natural skincare ingredients. But please remember that although ingredients are “natural” or vegan they can still be pore clogging and cause acne. I received this as a complimentary product.",0.0

I was pretty excited when I heard that this had been reformulated because I’ve tried it in the past and it broke me out. Sadly I had the same experience this time around. I can’t seem to pinpoint what it is in there that does it but right about at the 1 week mark of use I start to notice breakouts. If I continue to use it the breakouts get worse and they are the deeper ones that Seem to want to stick around for a long time. Since I knew that is how my skin reacted before I decided to stop using this as soon as the breakouts started. Luckily they have mostly cleared up now but I’ve got a couple on my cheek that are stubborn. Since I’ve never been able to use it for very long I can’t really speak to the anti aging benefits.

The old product was not packaed in a box but instead in a plastic sleeve/bag.  This old product was FAR softer than the current version (which, I will admit, is still pretty soft) and has none of the slubs or little brown spots that are in the current version.  I am guessing the current version is more environmentally friendly and less processed/bleached, which is great. However, it’s not as soft.  For me personally, I much prefer the older version :-(.",1.0
Broke my under eye area out horribly.   Tried on two different occasions and same result .,0.0
"I love this product. I’ve been using it for almost a month and I’ve definitely felt an seen the difference. I apply it at night daily, and in the morning my skin is plumped and radiant, with a pinkish undertone, similar to when you slightly blush. It feels like you just applied moisturizer",1.0
"I truly enjoy having this product as a part in my night time skin care regimen. I found that it doesn’t prevent breakouts but once you apply on an active one, it will calm redness and help towards preventing scars. I found my skin looks less red in the morning now and my pores are tighter (coming from a person with generally large pores). It has helped with scars that I’ve been fighting against for the past few months. In all, it’s a really great product as well as a effective one! 10/10 would recommend.",1.0
"Decent enough cleansing balm, I found it way too oily and irritating to use on my eyes, and it seemed to leave a residue. Definitely need to double cleanse. I prefer the Clinique one even despite the price difference.",0.0
"I accidentally ordered this moisturizer instead of the biossance gel one. Since stores aren’t open right now, I decided to give this one a go. Doesn’t work any magical wonders for my skin, it’s very average. But I can’t get over the smell!! It almost smells like rotten beer to me.",0.0
"Love love love this toner!! Was recommended to use due to my pigmentation from my acne scarring, and active hormonal breakouts. This also has added a glow to my skin which was a big surprise, and my skin feels super hydrated. Had to start slowly adding this to my routine, but now my skin can handle it everyday!",1.0
I really liked this product! It goes on really thick but it dissolves into your skin so nicely. I really feel like it does a Good job.,1.0
I loved this but then I found out it had alcohol in it :(( I don’t understand how it’s clean when it has straight alcohol.,0.0
"This face scrub has gone above and beyond my expectations! I like to use it for the full time and put it on just before sitting and relaxing after a long day but you can also use it by just doing a fast scrub. The scrub leaves your face feeling smooth and helps tighten the pores just like it says. However the scent as beautiful as it is does have a super strong smell while on the face, it doesn’t stick when you clean it off though. I love that the formula is vegan and cruelty free because that is something that is important to me",1.0
I used this product first thing at night and when I woke up. It’s now 12 hours later..I still have my makeup on but my undereyes are soo soft still! It definitely boosts hydration and keeps your under eyes soft and moisturized all day and night. If your looking for a nice eye cream that is quality and holds Hydration I would definitely reccomend. Definitely try Travel size first! This review was part of a complimentary sample,1.0
"This serum smells really nice and feels amazing on the skin. Leaves a very luxurious feeling and a little goes a long way. I got the sample version of this, the one that lasts for 7 days and even though I really like how this feels I didn’t notice anything regarding wrinkles or radiance. Maybe I would buy it just to see if in the long run I do see something.",1.0
Super beautiful the only reason im giving it four stars is because the white on the cap started chipping off and gets on my hands when I open it,1.0
"- Comes in polished packaging with a convenient dropper. Easy to use- Is not too tacky and absorbs well into the skin. I prefer to use it at night as a serum followed by moisturizer or sleep-in cream masks and wake up to soft, supple and hydrated skin- it claims to be made with 95% natural ingredients.- has a perfume like scent upon application which is not overpowering or lingering but quite pleasant - have not noticed any visible plumpness after a week of use. But not ready to write it off either. I believe good things take time to respond and show their magic. Products showcasing immediate results may not always be the best for our skin.- will continue using as I’m enjoying the product. May drop in after a few more weeks for another review.",1.0
"This provides a lot of moisture for me, it didn’t break me over however it did cause my malassezia to get worse! Must be an ingredient, but I have all of these little bumps now :(. Wanted to love, but it’s different for everyone! I’m glad it locks in the moisture though.",0.0
I first received a sample and I went on to purchase the full size. I’m on my second jar now and really loving this product!! I double cleanse so I use this to remove my makeup/any dirt on my face and I go back in with micellar water or another cleanser (depending on how heavy my make was that day). One jar lasted me about 6 months. This will permanently be part of my skin care routine.,1.0
"I originally bought this because in the winter my skin gets very dry and in first month I used it I noticed a significant  decrease in the dryness of my skin. However, during the second month I got blackheads in places that I’ve never gotten them, like my forehead and cheeks, and about two weeks after i stopped using it they went away.  I also noticed that I got little white bumps around my eyes, so if you use this make sure to avoid the thin skin around the eyes. I now use it only when my skin is really dry and never more than two nights in a row.",0.0
In love with this. Takes makeup off COMPLETELY and EFFORTLESSLY with a small amount. Tried UD melt off before this. Not as good. On my second tub of this,1.0
Creme de La Mer worked wonders on my dry skin. This moisturizer left my skin feeling hydrated all day. It was very easy to apply. Just rub a small amount between your fingers until it is translucent and then press gently into your skin. A little really does go a long way so the jar lasts a good amount of time. The Miracle Broth healing elixir made my skin look more vibrant. I received this product complimentary from La Mer.,1.0
"I really wanted to love this product. About a year or two ago I had received a sample and remembered really liking the gentle yet exfoliating qualities. It also has a good smell.  However when I bought the full size recently, it did not react well with my skin. I don’t normally have sensitive skin, but my face would break out around the cheek area whenever I used this.",0.0
Don’t really see any difference after using this for a few months. It looks pretty and smells good but is not any better than using just vaseline.,0.0
"I’ve had chemcial peels before and this process was so much more simple than going to an esthetician’s office. It’s a simple product soaked pad that makes it easy to apply all over your face, chest and shoulders. It was supposed to tingle but i felt a mild itch on my eyebrow but nothing alarming. I followed up with my moisturizer after 15 minutes and I was good to go! I woke up the next morning with soft glowing skin. I wouldn’t definitely try this peel again.",1.0
"I struggle with chronic mild-to-severe acne, and I was searching for a deep moisturizer that wouldn’t break my sensitive skin out. Hearing such fabulous things about Tatcha, I decided to spend 100 points to get a sample size of this cream. I’ve only been using it for 4 days now, and I will not be using it again. I don’t know why people rave so much about the scent - it smells like Vick’s Vaporub to me. It caused several dozens of tiny bumps to form all over my face just as my skin was clearing up, and made my acne flare up intensely. I am extremely disappointed in this product, and will now have to spend even more money trying to repair the damage this cream did to my face. Wish I never tried this! :(",0.0
"I wasn’t impressed with this. It gave me subtle hydration but other than that, I just really didn’t see any difference. If anything it made me break out the first couple of uses, but I don’t think it made my other skincare work any better.",0.0
This Lala Retro Whipped Moisturizer is my absolute favorite. It’s very light and instantly soaks into my dry skin. Areas where I have noticed the most benefit is around my nose (which is very dry from my seasonal cold nose blowing) and around my chin. I can see that my makeup blends easier due to my skin being better hydrated thanks to this lovely cream. The container is perfect and dispenses the exact amount needed. I received this product free for testing purposes but will purchase in the future as should you.,1.0
"Didn’t do anything positive for my skin, but didn’t do anything negative for my skin. Smells good, like fresh lemons. Overpriced. 3 stars.",0.0
"Honestly, I’m not sure how to feel about this product. Throughout the years I have always used glycolic acid because it has helped my acne! I was so excited to receive this product and finally try it out, it’s like a mini facial! I did love how it made my skin feel at first, but the next day my skin was very oily and very sensitive. It would almost hurt to wash my face because my skin felt so thin! I have always had fair combination skin that is somewhat sensitive, so this may be why. I am still glad that I had the opportunity to test this product out, and wish that I can try it again to see if I would get the same affect as the first time!",1.0
"Just nope. Doesn’t moisturize my dry patches, takes forever to dry. Personally this just doesn’t work for my skin.",0.0
"I love this lip mask and have been using it religiously for months as a part of my nightly skincare routine. It hydrates and keeps my lips soft like no other, buuuuut I just recently realized it contains dimethicone, which is a silicone derivative and is not something you want on your skin or much less on your lips to ingest. I am so disappointed they would put a silicone product in this, and will sadly not be repurchasing until they reformulate.",0.0
"One of my favourite cleansers! I have pretty oily skin, however, I don’t love completely stripping it when I wash my face. This cleanser cleans my face and removes oil, but leaves it still feeling soft, not squeaky. I’ve also noticed that my acne is much smaller in size and less frequent. Plus I think the kale smell is lovely :) I would recommend this product for oily skin!",1.0
Really not worth buying. It never took off the makeup and was weird and waxy it was such a waste of money. I tried to take off eyeliner used the cleansing balm twice and this was what was left over. It’s annoying I might as well have had just used makeup remover once and been done with it.,0.0
"the consistency is very thick, the application of the moisturizer is somewhat heavy, which i did not like, compared to other moisturizers i have used that were light and airy in application. once the moisturizer is absorbed and dried on my face, i felt that my skin was hydrated and moisturized - a good result, but application and texture was not so lightweight and airy as it was described.",0.0
"Not crazy about these. While they were super soft, I didn’t think they were markedly better and worth the $$",0.0
"I received this as a complimentary. First off, i’d like to say the packaging is so beautiful! It’s chic and looks luxurious. I notice they have small beads inside the product with the oil. That was cool. I applied them on, they have scent to it which i normally lean to non-fragrance product. It smelled nice though. They easily absorb onto your face. My face doesn’t seem to react, although the scent kind of lingers for a while after you put it on. I wouldn’t recommend this for those who are sensitive to fragrance, but overall great product! For me personally, i think you should do a research first and see if it’s worth your money and the value of adding this to your skincare. Otherwise, i will test this out a few more times and see how it goes!",0.0
Been a huge fan of Bobbi brown product and this one is hands down one of my favorite makeup base! Ut really hydrates and plumps my skin but doesn’t breakup my makeup! Feels very luxurious on the skin too!,1.0
I love it. ❤️ How it feel on my skin is amazingg,1.0
"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I chose this exfoliant. I’ve been testing out for the past 3 weeks and it has been a life saver! As you can see it’s a very liquid consistency, dries down fast and is easy to layer onto. At first, I wasn’t sure if I was seeing results but this is definitely more of a long term effect product. I use 3-4 times a week, about every other day, and have been loving that. I don’t use all over, I found that putting on my trouble areas has worked best for me. Such as my nose, forehead, and chin. Or any area I feel a breakout coming in, almost like a spot treatment. And I’ve noticed it stops the breakout right in its tracks! I’ve also noticed a more even, brighter complexion which was a big goal of mine from this product. I can’t wait to see what else it does later on!",1.0
This made Me break out and did nothing for my skin. Felt like watered down oil.,0.0
I received this item complimentary to review. I did not like the texture or the feel. It also had a white hint to it. However it does repel water.,0.0
"I received this sample size product for free in exchange for an honest review. I found that this product was a bit watery/runny on application. The scent was gentle and not too overpowering which I liked. I did feel that it moisturized my skin and was gentle, but other than that I didn’t notice too much of a difference as far as clearing up dark spots or evening skin tone. Maybe that is due to the fact that I was only able to use it for about a week. Overall not too bad when compared with other Vitamin C serums.",0.0
This eye cream plumps under eyes giving them a youthful look. I also noticed it helps with fine lines.,1.0
"There’s no way to apply this without tugging on your skin which defeats the purpose. I tried warming it up on my hand first but it doesn’t ever get melty. Maybe eventually it would but by then you will have used up half of the tiny stick on your hand trying to get it warm. It doesn’t transfer well from finger to under eyes either. Wish it was less waxy and more like a shea butter consistency. Also, any reputable retinol product should have the concentration listed.",0.0
"I wanted to like this soooo badly :(I saw this online and it was supposed to be a miracle product that cancels out redness and makes the skin look amazing while also being a great sunscreenI personally like the smell, it definitely is strong while you put it on, like a clean grassy minty smell, but as you apply it dissipates.I didn’t notice much about cancelling out any redness but it did make my under eye area look much lighter and brighter which I liked, however it just sat on top of my skin, grabbing on to any texture or hairs :(I have normal, acne prone skin, and have lots of little bumps and blackheads all over my face, and this made that A MILLION times worse. I tried it for about two or three weeks before I couldn’t handle the way my skin looked anymore. After about a week of not using it, my skin still hasn’t cleared up. I ended up buying MORE products to help clear it up.I would not recommend this if you wear makeup, have ANY texture, or have sensitive skin prone to those little “acne bumps” or fungal acneYou’ll probably love this if you have perfect skin but just need a little color correction",0.0
Extremely thick and does not feel really hydrating at all. I got it thinking it would be a good night cream but I woke up each time feeling more dry than using my normal moisturizer.,0.0
"I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I’ve used it for about 2 and 1/2 weeks now! It goes on smooth and feels like silk and smells really fresh and light! It doesn’t leave a film and absorbs quickly! The results are amazing! Skin tones have definitely been improved, the only dislike is it is recommended not to go into sun while using, so I use it at night. Definitely recommend!",1.0
"First off it smells like bubblegum and seriously a little goes a long way. Good thinking on their part of adding a little rubber spatula because this stuff is sticky if you get it on your hands. This product will literally last you forever so the price is very fair, you only need a little bit depending on how thick you want to apply this stuff. I can say this stays on all night, when I wake up I still feel the product on my lips compared to when I used to use a regular lip balm and it’d be gone before I knew it. My lips do feel hydrated for the couple hours in the morning when I wipe it off but I guess my lips are always dry from drinking water all the time, but that doesn’t give any reason to not buy this product!",1.0
"It’s a basic lip balm. Save your money and buy one from the drugstore. The texture is nice, but the watermelon scent seems so cheap.",0.0
"I never used to use sunscreen in my skincare because I wasn’t aware of how important it was - of course now I am aware and can tell you how much I love this stuff! It’s not heavy on the skin, light, with a nice scent to it. It almost gives me a glow after I put it on after my moisturizer! I’ll use this on weekends when I’m out and about. Make sure you shake before using because the product might be separated. Other than that I’d definitely recommend this product!",1.0
this product so amazing! I have so much dark spots on my face and this serum really help!! will buy again.,1.0

I absolutely love this spray! I like to spray it on in the morning before I start my priming process. It gives a tingling minty feel that really wakes up the skin! It’s also ads a nice hydrated glow!,1.0
The Sunday Riley auto correct brightening and depuffing eye contour cream works great! It reduced the look off puffiness under my eyes and made them appear lest tired. They made my eyes look more vibrant and beautiful.  I really enjoy this product and think the packaging is great. It comes in an easy pump bottle. The bottle is a great long lasting size. Would recommend this product.,1.0
I wanted to love this but it made my skin break into a rash/tiny bumps that I suspect is a reaction to their formulation. It is similar to smash box primer—has a slick texture and it is clear which is a plus. I think if you’re blessed with naturally beautiful skin and not so sensitive this might work. I wanted the higher spf this product offers but not at the expense of having bumpy skin :( I think glossier is a good alternative if you are looking for that clear/transparent look. But for now I’ll stick to hourglass veil primer even with the low spf and whitish look...hope this helps,0.0
This product really makes the skin GLOW! It also really helps removes those pesky dark spots. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the lemony smell. If you like that smell than you won’t have any other problem with it!,1.0
"I receive this product free to trial from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.This moisturizer feels so luxurious. It’s thick and creamy and feels heavy and smooth upon application. However, it doesn’t sit heavy on the skin. It sinks in really nicely and doesn’t leave a stickiness or oiliness. I don’t love the scent and it’s very fragrant. I also don’t know that it feels like it’s very effective at smoothing my skin, however, I’ve only used it for 3 weeks so it may not be enough time to assess that, but I haven’t noticed a visible difference. Overall it’s nice but smells so strongly I wouldn’t want it as a permanent staple in my routine.",0.0
This is a great and effective serum to target acne and pores! It’s priced very fairly and is a product I have repurchased. The dropper bottle allows the product to remain sanitary and be easily applied. Unfortunately this serum pills and may be difficult to layer under certain moisturizers.,1.0
"This product is way too thick that it makes it hard to massage the face without irritating the skin--it requires a forceful rubbing action. I’ve never seen an oil product this thick and after using it once, I returned it.",0.0

I wanted to like this sunscreen a lot because it’s the first clear sunscreen I’ve used and was super excited. But it felt SO greasy and just oily on my skin. I’ll continue to use until empty but wouldn’t repurchase.,0.0
Honestly was disappointed with this product. I love my other ordinary products but this one just didn’t work for me. I couldn’t see any difference with the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes even after weeks of very consistent use.,0.0
Nice product but I feel like it broke me out a little bit.  I also wish a smaller amount went further.  Overall my skin feels nice but I am not in love.,1.0

"I never do my skincare routine without this. I notice a difference in how the other products are absorbed and the hydration of my skin during the day. Best applied on damp skin, 3-4 drops.",1.0
Call me crazy but I actually like using this as a moisturizer. Use a thin layer and give about 10 minutes to set in and it just makes your face look so glowy and supple. 10/10 would recommend.,1.0
A great light weight moisturizer that helps hydrate my combination skin without making it feel too oily or too dry. It’s not quite hydrating enough for me in the winter but I always seem to go back to it in the other seasons. It’s a great value for the price too!,1.0
I’ve never used this product and was thinking about using it but according to  the Healthy Living Powered by Skin deep app this is NOT a clean product so for that reason I will not be trying this out and I would highly recommend getting the app it shows you the ingredients and rates them and you can look up the ingredients for yourself.,0.0
"Such a great addition to my skin care regimen. I have been having seasonal dryness, but find that most heavy moisturizers cause me to break out. I am happy to say that this one doesn’t! What I love about this mask is it’s versatility - it can be leave-on or wash off; for ten minutes or overnight. I have definitely noticed a difference in the “suppleness“ of my skin, which has been making my fine lines less noticeable.",1.0
I love this stuff!  My expectations were as low as the price tag and I’ve been blown away.,1.0
"It’s okay for wetting beauty sponges, and that’s about it. I keep one in my gym bag and the other with my makeup and I just never reach for it. I could just as easily buy the actual water bottle and put in a spray bottle. Not worth the money in my opinion.",0.0
I love this moisturizer! The matte formula is so creamy and hydrating on my dry skin and it hide impurities like blemishes and rosecea. It works beautifully under foundation as it make skin so smooth!,1.0

"So I originally tried this product in a set and all I can say is I’m blown away. My skin has never had such a natural glow, from a lightweight product. I’ve been using this serum for over three months and all I can say is I’m in love!",1.0
Been using this for over a week now and felt results within the first couple of days.  I have oil/dry combo skin and I feel like it evens it out for me and works well.  It keeps my skin feeling moisturized longer and the formula absorbs quickly into my skin so I can finish my skincare routine quicker which I like.  Has a slight fragrance but I don’t mind it at all.   I just care that it works!,1.0

"This was the first makeup remover balm I tried and I love it! It’s less messy than using cleansing oils and I love how the texture is very light and sorbet like. It smells very refreshing and it’s easy to massage it on my skin. I like that it leaves a clean but not squeaky feeling on my face (I still do double cleanse regardless). I gave it 4/5 because of the cost, I know i’ll finish this in about 3 months vs the large Shu Uemura cleansing oil that typically takes me a year to finish at ~$85.",1.0
"I bought this lip balm on vib sale thinking it would be my winter chapped lip saviour. Unfortunately nothing like that happened as soon as applying it feels smooth and super hydrating but in under 30 mins it makes my lip skin so hard that i had to peel it off.

So, if just that small of an amount was able to do that for my skin- I am sure that with continued use, my skin would reap several benefits.

I did not have any tingling, but I use exfoliates on a regular basis so my skin may be immune to that sensitive sensation.

This is a good serum for people that need moisture. If you have oily skin then this isn’t the one for you. It will make you break out if you use it everyday.

"I’ve never had a face cream quite like this one.

I recommended getting the largest size offered, it lasts quite a long time and the touch-less pump definitely helps reduce bacteria from cream to face.  Price point is worth it, such soft skin as a result of this hydrating cream.",1.0
This cream is super hydrating a little goes a long way but the finish wow my skin is so soft it’s a skin staple for me and my dry skin i recieved this complimentary from influenster and i’m so happy i came across this brand,1.0
It was gifted by Glow Recipe in exchange for my honest opinion. The serum is light and absorbs quickly. It has a slight cucumber smell to it. I didn’t smell avocado at all. Unfortunately it didn’t do anything to my skin. I had a fresh feeling but that’s about it. The bottle is cute but not a fan of the applicator. I will probably use it only in summer as its light weight.,0.0
"This is a nice feeling oil, but for me it never really absorbed into my skin. It has very little smell, which is nice. It worked better for me when I mixed it into a moisturizer then when I used it on its own. Overall there are oils that I like a lot better for my skin type.",0.0
I received this as a sample and was able to make it last about 2 weeks. I used it as part of my night time routine. It is nice and thick and ultra moisturizing. I like the fact that it doesn’t spread. It takes a little time to absorb but again I used it at night so it didn’t matter. I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. I haven’t had any problems with breakouts or irritation. I would buy the larger size but I prefer the Belief moisturizing eye bomb which is similar in size and price. Although I do like the product I wasn’t moved enough to make a switch.,1.0
AMAZING. been using this for over a year and i freaking LOVE IT.,1.0
"Received this product as #freeproduct. I like that the fragnance is not strong and this one is not greasy either. I used it during the day time, as part of my daily routine. The skin felt smooth, but it did not do much to leave it hydrated. I think using it for longer time may have better visible effect.",0.0
"Got this as a birthday gift, and I absolutely love it. I am transitioning all my skincare to clean products without fragrance because I have sensitive skin. I wear it under my makeup, and it makes application a charm. I also use it at night so my skin can be nice and hydrated in the morning. This is definitely my go to mask now!",1.0
"I don’t get it. I have oily skin, so this didn’t do anything for me. I ended up using the sample for my legs.",0.0
The smell is too much for me. Smells like sunscreen on my lips. Not favourite lip balm either.,0.0
So I received a sample of this cream a long time ago and loved it. I got the full size in February 2019 and it’s May 2019 and I haven’t even used half of it. A little goes a long way. I have super oily skin and this doesn’t clog my pores. It is light and hydrating. I will never stop using this as my day cream.,1.0
"I was expecting more from this product, but was left very disappointed. Salicylic acid is quite harsh on my sensitive acne-prone skin.",0.0
"This is the only facial cleanser both my boyfriend, sister and I have been able to share. He has acne prone skin while my sister has dry skin and I have combination skin. This cleanser cleans your face without it being stripping, without irritation, and the fragrance is very soft and natural so it’s not gendered. Love love love. I tried going back to my Soy facial cleanser and it just didn’t measure up at all. Will definitely be repurchasing.",1.0
I was gifted by Dermalogica.  The product was very nice on my sensitive face. It did not break my skin out and I felt like the little trail packets gave the right amount to use each time. I felt like my face was glowing.,1.0
I have dry/sensitive skin and this product has made my dry skin worse. I have used this for about five days and would often have to use a cleansing lotion or I would have patchy dry spots all over my face.,0.0
I received this in my Influencer #voxbox and I have to say I’m glad I got a free sample instead of buying it. I have sensitive skin and this did not agree with my skin at all.,0.0
Calms and soothes my skin when it’s feeling angry. I suffer from acne blemishes and eczema on my face and find the coconut wipes are gentle and cooling and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.,1.0
"I love the balm texture, it’s very creamy and soft like a cloud around the eye area. It does absorb very quickly without leaving any residue, plus it’s fragrance free which is perfect for my sensitive skin.  I highly recommend it!",1.0

"This is suppose to help with sensitive skin, but it made mine red, dry and itchy.  Strange bc I can use the adaptogen spray which I loveee!",0.0
"Made me break out, if you have sensitive skin, do not use this cream! It has a very strong fragrance which smells nice but the cream made me break out on three different occasions. Super bummed!",0.0
"I did not like this product. It contains fragrance that I found to be super irritating, and it broke me out just after one use. I would love to try it again, if there was no fragrance.",0.0
"Dior dream skin care perfect is definitely one of my favorites. When I put it on my skin it just soaked it right up no oily feeling No stickiness it made my skin feel like velvet. Within a couple of days I could tell a difference around my eyes and in my forehead. Not everyone is going to be able to afford this product but if you can I would and if you find it on sale at my two , highly recommended.",1.0
I was hype to try this based on reviews and I was looking for something more affordable(I’m a SuperGoop user) so I thought I’d give it a try. This was not it. It left me super shiny and feeling clogged. The minute I stepped outside I was an oil slick. I’m just gonna pay the extra and stick with SuperGoop,0.0
Best thing ever!! Gets rid of pimples over 1 night. I don’t have severe acne but a few pimple pop up once in a while and these hearing dots are able to get rid of them,1.0
"I have ultra sensitive, reactive and acne prone skin and, rather than controlling acne as described, I woke up with whiteheads all over my face after just one use. I’m hyper vigilant about ingredients in the hopes that I can avoid reactions and I’ve used Niacinamide products before without issue so I’m pretty sure the Zinc caused this reaction.  Clearly many people love this but I don’t recommend it to those with sensitive skin.",0.0
pretty awesome considering how wiggy the concept of a peeling gel was to me the first time i used it. works super well,1.0
This product is just okay. It has a lot of essential oils and oils which makes the product very slippery and oily. When I wash it off I still feel the oil on my face. It smells very nice however but all those oils are not needed. I also don’t think it works that amazing. I always have to go in with a face wash or other form of makeup remover to wash off the rest of my makeup. I wanted to love it since I have been wanting to try a cleansing balm but I think this one needs some work.,0.0
"I was excited to try this product. Sunblock is a daily must for me. I thought this would be great because I was looking for something clear, without the white residue and I already have a tinted sunscreen I like (Coola). I wore this twice, not as a primer but bare faced just out and about running errands. Sadly, I am returning it. I felt like silicone was just sitting on my face. It was uncomfortable for me and left my mostly dry skin feeling like an oily silicone slick. Many people seem to like it so it’s just a matter of preference and what you want your skin to feel like.",0.0
Hydrating. But I don’t feel like it did anything to my skin and I feel like I can always smell some sort of spicy-ness. Don’t like it :/,0.0
"I got this in this months beauty box and I’m DEFINITELY buying the full version. I have extremely oily skin on my nose but right on my cheeks are very dry, I can put this all over my face and it somehow evens out the dryness AND the oil. I absolutely love this product!",1.0
"I’ve been using this product for a little bit and didn’t notice anything.  I’ve recently got a zit on my nose and I haven’t had one on my nose in decades.  I assumed this was a coincidence and was going to continue using it because of all the great reviews.  I just heard that the FTC charged Sunday Riley with directing her employees to create multiple usernames and use different VPNs to make hundreds, maybe thousands of fake reviews for their products. This is disgusting and I will no longer use these products. I would hope Sephora will do their due diligence and remove the fake reviews.",0.0
It works so well on me because it doesn’t dry me out! Love the way my makeup just disappears so I’m super happy! Love all my Glow recipe products :),1.0
"Not worth it as a cure for chapped lips per say, but def a nice gloss that won’t ruin your lips. Def overhyped by all the IG bloggers.",0.0
Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and glowy! I will definitely be using this during the winter months when I need that extra oomf,1.0
I was really excited when I received this to test for free especially because my skin is really dry. This doesn’t exactly sink into the skin it just dries ontop and leaves me with residue.,0.0
"Probably the best lip balm I’ve ever used. This was my life saver while on accutane, and my lips were dry and peeling like crazy. It is a bit pricey at $26 but it’s totally worth the money!!!!",1.0
"It is the second time that you used a product of this brand And the truth is that I just fell totally in love with this new product!Its texture is undoubtedly unmatched and I love that when rubbed with your hands it looks like a unique foami sensation.

I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have extremely dry skin and my skin drinks this up and feels supple and clean. It didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy.,1.0
Complimentary from Dermalogica. This is a great precleanse. I also use it as a cleanser itself when I’m not wearing foundation. It works perfectly fine and goes t dry out my skin. I prefer to use this in the morning when I skin is oilier.,1.0
"I loved this the first few times I used it. My face felt nice and smooth and really saw results in my fine wrinkles...But then my face started feeling heavy and tight about a week into using it and started to break out.  I’m 47 and never have breakouts, so this was wierd to me..but this was the only product I tried that was new in my skincare regimen. I researched and saw that others had the same reaction. For such an expensive product I am shocked. Thank God I can return it. My skin really reacts in a bad way to it. BTW..I have normal skin. I never have breakouts, I have fine lines and sometimes dehydrated skin.",0.0
"I’ve been using this product for a couple of weeks, im a big fan! It keeps my dry skin hydrated all day! It is on the thicker side but absorbs well, even on hot summer days! It does have a strong fragrance but not unbearable.",1.0
"I have tried multiple makeup removers for eye makeup especially, and none have worked as well as this does. I was using a cotton ball and all kinds of makeup remover from The Body Shop, Lancome, Micellar Cleansing Water, and all of them irritated my eyes and did not remove everything. This cleansing balm from Clinique is the only makeup remover that takes off ALL my eye AND face makeup, at the same time...even my stubborn eyeliner in the water line! I scoop out a portion about the size of a quarter and get it all over my hands. I apply it to my DRY face that I have not washed yet, and rub all over. You don’t have to rub and press hard, just circular motions, starting with your closed eyes. Then i get the rest of my face covered in it, and THEN rinse with water. I absolutely love it and I’m about to purchase my third container of it this year!",1.0
"This item was gifted by Dermalogia in exchange for my honest opinion. I liked the way this cleanser foamed but i did not appreciate the way it made my skin dry. I think it was too harsh for daily use for my skin. So i may try it 3 times a week, and use a more hydrating cleanser on the opposite days.",0.0
"This is good stuff. Gentle but effective. The first day I used it my face turned a bit red, but after that it went back to it’s usual color.",1.0
Happily replaced my Clinique Clarifying Lotion!!,1.0
"I actually love The Ordinary products, but not this one. I like when hyaluronic acid serums glide and this one did not. It dried quickly, too quickly. It was a great price point, but not worth rebuying. It’s still better than not using hyaluronic acid",0.0
"I received this product as a sample from a Sephora purchase. This was the first Biossance product I ever tried and I really wanted to like the brand and the cream.However, this cream did not work well for my skin. I have dry and oily combination skin. I tried the cream once in the morning on my clean face and it gave me a few acne on my cheeks on the same day. I guess the cream was a little heavy for me. It felt tacky during application and took a long time to be absorbed. The smell was also distinct and very medicine-like, which I liked, but some people may find it unpleasant.So, I would recommend to try it as a sample first if possible before purchasing the product.",0.0
I brought this product because in the winter time my lips are not the best. I always switch up during the winter and have to keep my lips moisturized. This product smells cheap and the recovery for better lips is a complete lie. I brought the entire set and if it was good I was going to buy this for the family. I try the product out for 2 weeks and all my lips did was peel This is a bad product and very ghetto 1 Star would not recommend,0.0
I love this. Easy to use and my face feels so smooth after I use it.,1.0
"Since started using Ordinary Niacinamide, I didn’t need to use Neutrogena Rapid Clear anymore.",1.0
I like this product. It’s light weight. Absorbs quickly. Plays well under makeup. But I really did not see a difference in my under eye area. I find drugstore eye cream that work better for a fraction of the cost.,0.0
"Since turning 40, I decided that I really needed to start taking better care of my skin if I hope to retain a more youthful appearance.  I have combination skin with the oily areas being concentrated on my forehead and nose - these areas are also prone to the occasional pimple and blackheads. After reading reviews, I hoped that Confidence in a Cream would provide all the benefits I currently need. I immediately noticed the soft creamy texture and subtle and pleasant citrus scent. It’s very light and fresh which I didn’t expect because I’m used to unscented moisturizers (although I prefer scented products). I applied a small amount to start off since I didn’t know how my skin would react. I applied to my face, neck and decollette to start. After about a week, while I did notice my skin was glowing, I also experienced small breakouts on my cheeks, jawline and forehead. The only thing I can attribute it too is this moisturizer unfortunately. I’m a believer in that you need to give products several weeks to see an outcome so I’ll keep using it and see if my skin improves. If not, then I guess I’ll be on the hunt for a new moisturizer. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.",1.0
"I had always wanted to try this so I was excited to receive it. I decided to try the essence for a week by itself and a week with the cream to see if there was a difference. My skin has been a wreck because of mask wearing and working 12 hour nursing shifts added to the stress of work. Alone with my regular moisturizer, it provided a good base to hydrate my skin and made it feel like velvet. Paired with the cream, I didn’t even have the breakouts I normally have around my mouth area from mask wearing nor did I have issues with all over hormonal breakouts the week before my cycle began. I didn’t want to love this product because I am going to have to purchase more but I am so glad I got to indulge myself with a small bottle I received for the purposes of reviewing prior to purchasing. It is definitely a replacement for my beloved Nuxe essence that I’ve been using for years.",1.0
I tried to use this two different times . Both times I broke out and it left dried patches on my skin!! I have combination skin. I received as a sample and would not purchase!,0.0
"There is a reason why there are so many 5 star reviews. It really is amazing. It did take me a few tries to figure out how to effectively take off mascara with this product but other than that no complaints. The instant the balm touches your skin, the makeup melts. It leaves my skin feeling clean and supple. I do recommend you double cleanse and follow this product with your daily cleanser and skin care routine.",1.0
"This melting butter cleanser does it’s job and gets rid of make-up pretty well. I do feel like this cleansing balm doesn’t do a solid job at removing certain makeup like my tubing mascara or heavy eye makeup. However, it is extremely thick and greasy. I do double cleanse and that helps remove a film that it leaves on my face. I also dislike the packaging. I usually leave this in my bathroom because that’s where I take off my make-up (near a sink/in the shower) and I thought I would love the magnet on the scoop so it can easily attach to the lid, but there’s a flaw in this packaging design. The magnet behind the scoop rusts and the rust crumbles all over the packaging and that’s really annoying because it can easily get in the product sometimes when it happens. Not a big fan of this packaging anymore. Is there a way to hide the magnet in the scooper like you did with the lid? That would make it sooo much better.Overall, decent product. Would rate it 3.5/5. The amount of money you spend for this product size is still pretty decent. However, I still think I might prefer other brands’ make-up removing balm a little better.",0.0

"this toner goes bad QUICK, mine actually started to turn brown which was really weird. it never happened to me before so i googled what was going on and what i found out was that this tone was oxidizing and going bad. so i would not recommend this product for anyone to use because i don’t see how this would be good for the skin, i threw it away. i was super excited to try this so it was a bummer.",0.0
"This product definitely feels “wet“, but is not very moisturizing, and really irritated my sensitive and dry skin. Definitely not worth the 52 dollars.",0.0

"LOVE the packaging at the control I had to prepare the product when I was ready instead of having the serum go off because I wasn’t ready to start using it yet. The formula itself is a pleasure to use and it didn’t interfere with any of my other skincare or makeup steps. Immediate results were a bit brighter skin, but mostly improved texture to the touch after a few uses. I’m excited to see results over a longer period of use!",1.0

"This cream is very hydrating but I dropped a star because it can’t be used under foundation as it leaves a film on skin that is peeled of when foundation is applied. First I thought it was my skin, but I did a test with this cream on half face. So it remains to be used either alone in the morning or at night. Other than this complain, I love it. It is highly hydrating and sinks in my skin without being greasy. It is true it is winter and my skin is drier.",1.0
"I started using this oil in the winter when I needed something a little heavier to help with my dry skin. Not only did it keep my skin soft and supple, but I’ve rarely had a pimple since and there were less fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I stopped using it for a while when I was traveling and my skin suffered without it. I only apply in the evening and the first bottle I purchased lasted almost a year so it’s well worth the price, IMO. I’m on my second bottle and now I use it throughout the year.",1.0
It literally just has plastic in it and smells disgusting. I started using it and a few days later I saw two new (highly) painful pimples. Not sure if this is to blame or the weather. Yes it does the job but also contributes to water pollution (so depends which is more important for you).,0.0
"Used for 2 months. No big results. Good for dry skin, very moisturizing. Applied to close to lash line will cause gland blockage. Not worth the price IMO.",0.0
"I honestly didn’t like the way this felt on my skin, it felt more like a face wash soapy like",0.0
"Although this product has received amazing reviews (which are completely valid) I am sad to say I don’t think it is the right one for those with sensitive skin. I have been using clinique all my life and looked to switch with Drunk Elephant due to the high reviews. However after 2 days of using this and the jelly cleanser, my face began to heat up, burn, and itch. I began to see redness on my cheeks mostly. I reacted poorly to it. Luckily it was a “birthday gift“ so I used the little gift as a tester for my skin, I was glad I did before even thinking of purchasing this expensive thing. Im sure it works for most girls but for sensitive skin ones like me, this ain’t it champ.",0.0
"This cleanser does what it says: cleans my face without irritating my skin. It’s gentle but still foams up very well so my face feels clean after use. However, I couldn’t stand the smell at all. I don’t know where the scent comes from but it was absolutely horrible. If you’re sensitive to smells as I am I would not recommend this at all.",0.0
Gifted by Glow RecipeThere are so many things I love about this product! You only need a dab in the four areas of your face to instantly hydrate and plump your skin. My skin feel so soft and smooth immediately after applying it and if looks so glowy without looking or feeling oily.Almost as important (if not more tbh) is that this is a refillable jar!,1.0
"This stuff is awesome, makes my face look smooth and covers red spots, has spf so also a plus. I don’t usually have time during the week to do my make up. I love that I can just put this stuff on and go. It covers my dark circles if I’m tired and my red/pink areas.",1.0
One of the best moisturizer out there! I would recommend to anyone!,1.0
"I have never written a review but this deserves my first. My holy grail got too expensive for me and I was looking elsewhere. Tried 1-2 other products and they broke me out bad after a month (normal skin leaning towards oily, somewhat sensitive), little bumps, patchy... my skin progress hit a steep decline. I saw this and the milkiness threw me off but the reviews were good and decided to give it a shot. When I tell you this got my skin all the way right IN ONE DAY. Incredible product. My skin is plump, smooth, vibrant... no little bumps, nothing. It took one day, I’m not even kidding. I have been using this for about a week, twice a day. I don’t know which ordinary products i can/cant use with this but i am slowly working them in. Happy to have found my new holy grail.",1.0
"You need to use a generous amount of the product in order to remove a full face of makeup, so the bottle goes by quick. The Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm is significantly cheaper and you do not have to use as much product in one use.",0.0

"I receive this product free to trial from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.This moisturizer feels so luxurious. It’s thick and creamy and feels heavy and smooth upon application. However, it doesn’t sit heavy on the skin. It sinks in really nicely and doesn’t leave a stickiness or oiliness. I don’t love the scent and it’s very fragrant. I also don’t know that it feels like it’s very effective at smoothing my skin, however, I’ve only used it for 3 weeks so it may not be enough time to assess that, but I haven’t noticed a visible difference. Overall it’s nice but smells so strongly I wouldn’t want it as a permanent staple in my routine.",0.0

"I really like this moisturizer. It is light when you apply it to your face, and a little goes a pretty long way. It helped to smooth out my skin and soften it after using harsh and drying face washes, so it was especially great for that. It also did not have a harsh smell to it or have any harsh effects on my skin. I did receive this product complimentary, however, I still really enjoyed the product in general. However, I do not think I’d pay the regular price for this product. I did really love it, but I feel like I could settle for less expensive products that do almost as good a job. I did appreciate that the moisturizer was natural and clean beauty, though, as that was a plus!",1.0
"I’ve been using this product every night for over a year (on my second one). I have only positive things to say about this mask. It smells/tastes great, and it has a pleasant texture - not too sticky. It doesn’t make a mess, such as getting on my pillows or in my hair when I sleep. Whenever I forget to put it on at night, I notice the difference the next morning now. Since I started using this, I’m used to waking up with hydrated lips and having soft lips all day. I also have sensitive lips, and will have allergic reactions to some products, but this one is perfect and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s worth the price since it lasts so long! I used it every night for about a year and it lasted me that entire time.",1.0
"At first I really liked this cleanser. Less than a week in I got dry patches under my eyes that itched horribly. I wasn’t sure if it was the cleanser or not so I continued using it and as soon as I stopped using it, it got better. My acne never cleared up but got worse within the month I used it. Will be returning!",0.0
"One of the best cleansers I have used. Super gentle. You can even use it to remove eye make up. When I put it on, I feel like I’m at a spa because of the lovely cucumber scent.  I was so happy to see the value size and make sure to snag one during one of the recent sales.",1.0
"This balm takes me right back to the late 90s- early 2000s.  It’s poppin’ as a lip gloss, and keeps my lips so soft and smooth, just like the sleeping lip mask. And the berry scent reminds me of my old Lip Smackers. Love it!",1.0
The product itself is nice but the refill is very disappointing for its price! It does not fit in the container and you will lose a lot of product in the process of closing it. It seems that there is too much product in the refill jar and that’s why the original jar is not full in the first place!,0.0
"The first week I loved this product!! The smell is great and I love the texture. I have fairly sensitive skin so I was very happy. I used it every night. Following the first week though, my lips felt even more dry than before I started to use this product. I think I’d recommend Vaseline over this product if you’re dealing with dry lips. Overpriced and unnecessary IMO",0.0
I was so excited to purchase this product after an employee referred me to it. I’ve been using it 2x daily but haven’t noticed any improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and it hasn’t helped puffiness/dark circles either. I wouldn’t recommend this product.,0.0
"This was a 50/50 for me. If I received it in a value pack or as a freebie would I use it again? Absolutely. Would I go out of my way to buy it?

Cons: Can’t say I saw any actual results with it, and the jar was really hard to get into.",0.0

Your skin will thank you. I’m now a huge Tatcha fan!",1.0

This cream is so nice and hydrating! It is on the thicker side so maybe use this one in the colder months so it does not feel as heavy on the skin. I love the creamy texture and consistency of it too. It does have a rose scent to it (I do not mind it) but if fragrance bothers you I would maybe try a mini or sample first!,1.0
"I’ve used this for the past week during my nighttime routine and I wake up with my skin noticeably brighter! I haven’t really noticed a difference in pore size but that was never really a problem of mine.

I really wanted to love it, but this is incredibly disappointing and I hope they clean it up.",0.0

I usually skip face makeup, but this made me even more confident about doing so. This is definitely up there in my top favorite masks and even general beauty products.",1.0
Broke me out horribly due to Octyl Palmitate being so high up on the ingredient list. I was not expecting such a known acne causing ingredient in ‘clean’ skincare. If you are acne prone this may be a hard pass which is sad because I LOVE everything else about this. The texture is amazing and it simply sinks into my skin while still feeling like it will protect my moisture barrier.,0.0
I have NEVER IN MY LIFE tried a product as good as this one. I use these every night and they have helped my skin SO much. I have also used them for body acne and these tiny dots never fail to amaze. PLEASE buy these if you are considering. You will not be sorry.,1.0
"I am interested to give this product a try with a full-size so I can clearly see the results. As I received this in a sample size for 7 days, I cant be sure if I have seen the best of the results yet and I can justify the product but yes, I can surely say that the initial results are really good that my skin have started to look radiant and definitely smoother because I have super dry skin which needs extra hydration.This serum with one of my favorite skincare ingridient, turmeric, have started to help my skin look fresh, glowy and healthier.I love the texture which is super light and easily absorbent in to the skin.I would definitely give it a try and get a full-size to see the full results for myself.",1.0
I love mostly all GOOP products including this one. I used the exfoliation product and literally my skin was so smooth after. Going to continue doing this product 1-2x a week.,1.0
I’m a huge love trying new skincare products. This serum so far has felt nice on my face.  It’s not greasy and it doesn’t just sit on my face. My skin do feel soft and moisturized after using also. I only wish that the company would update the packaging for the product.,1.0
Didn’t care for this product that much as it doesn’t remove your mascara very well and dries my skin a little,0.0
I received this complemtary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I love to use this for a moisturizer at night. I have dry skin and this soothes it! The only thing I don’t like is the smell.,1.0
"it did nothing then days later, my skin reacted and now my head has 2 dots where the patches are. I have clear skin all year round and when I use this it ruined my skin :(",0.0
I have been a ride or die for this product for years! It is one of the only makeup melters that actually removes waterproof mascara and my full coverage foundation without having to scrub my skin raw. I go in with a little micellar water afterwards to ensure that my skin is all set and I’m good to go! Complimentary from Dermalogica.,1.0
"I like a lot about this cleanser. It’s a glass bottle - awesome as it’s not plastic, also makes me nervous to have glass in the bathroom since I am good at breaking things - and a nice consistency. I like the amount of foam and feel. My skin felt good after.However, for all it’s amazing ingredients, it made me break out. I wasn’t able to pin point what exactly in it didn’t work with my skin. I’m thankful for Sephora’s return policy so I was able to take it back and get something that I didn’t react to.",0.0
i’ve only been using this for 3 days and i have already noticed a HUGE difference. i had a few scabs on my face too from pimples and it helped those heal up fast as well as getting rid of my small breakouts. great product.,1.0
I’ve been using this for over a year now and honestly haven’t noticed a much of a difference. It’s nice to add in with an eye treatment and the price point is great. But probably won’t repurchase,1.0
"Im so disappointed with this product, i couldnt wait to get it only to be dissatisfied, this is not a scrub its just alil gritty , and the texture is so thin i had to keep applying it to feel like i had something on my face . IM gonna give a few days to see if i see a difference like in the comments before me but i know i will be returning because this is definitely a waste of money",0.0
"I received this product from the birthday gift set. I chose the product because of all the hype and good reviews. I have combination skin (super oily nose and normal skin everywhere else) and this product resulted in me having EXTREMELY dry and flaky skin. I didn’t add any other new product to my routine except this but about two days after using this, I started to see some flakiness and eventually dryness. This really confuses me because everyone else said that it’s either too oily or perfect so I might’ve gotten a bad batch or something. Overall I had a terrible experience with this product.",0.0
Don’t do it if you are even remotely breakout prone! Thankfully I got a free sample packet of this before purchasing. Made my skin red as soon as I applied it and after rinsing I had 4 new blemishes within hours! I am not very acne prone but I do get the occasional one or two around that time of the month. My skin felt and looked no different after rinsing aside from the new breakout that came that same day:(  if your skin is sensitive at all skip on this!,0.0
"I have combination skin, which is prone to sensitivity. The texture of the cream was nice, but it caused a lot of irritation and redness.  I used this three times, and it didn’t cooperate with my skin.",0.0
My face is super dry and this was an extremely nourishing and helpful product!,1.0
"I didn’t find this gel hydrating. I started with 2 pumps, moved to 3, then moved to 6 and did not feel a difference. I also followed with the protini moisturizer using progressively more of that as well and my skin was unusually parched. I don’t even have dry skin so this was pretty strange.",0.0
"Holy crap. My skin has never been so smooth as it is after using this stuff. After ONE use I noticed a difference: scaly patches gone and a fresh ’layer’ of skin. Pretty shiny, but not in an oily way. It stings a teeny bit at first but it dissipates after a minute or two. Get off the fence and buy it.",1.0
Love this it works wonderful. I highly recommend this product.,1.0
"This is my second purchase of this.  The first one I bought lasted me 1.5 years. Your face must be dry when you put this on and this is my time for a face massage!!  Then I use a hot face cloth to wipe the product off my face. My skin feels clean, hydrated, and light (if that makes sense). I’ve never had to contact their customer service but there are many customers who have been spoken to horribly and for that I cannot buy any more products. I’ve found dupes for what I used to buy, but I haven’t found a product that comes close to the price and formula.",1.0
"I like that it includes cantaloupe, which I’ve heard good things. It is a jelly cleanser that removes all traces of makeup, excess oil, pollution, and any other grime from the day. It is also free of fragrance. However, I have to mix it with a more moisturizing or scrub as I find it drying otherwise. May be worth trying for oily or acne prone skin.",1.0
Loved this products! Great for my dry skin!,1.0
"I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. I love every Origins product I’ve tried, and this one is no different. It’s still moisturizing but not too heavy or greasy for combination/oily skin. If you have dry skin, I would recommend the original GinZing moisturizer.",1.0
"Charlotte’s magic cream has lived up to its name for me and has exceeded my expectations. I has helped me with my goal of glowing skin. I love that it has hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and E. These ingredients combined help brighten and even out my skin tone and helps hydrate and plump my mature skin. I’ve been using the Charlotte magic massage technique when using this cream and have had been happy with the way my skin looks and feels. I love that it helps provide  a smooth canvas for makeup application. I’ve been loving bringing the product down my neck and on my décolleté. I enjoy the experience using this product as part of my skincare routine.",1.0
I received a one week sample and the only thing I noticed was how soft it left my skin It was a bit sticky which I didn’t like it.,0.0
This lip balm smells great and is moisturizing BUT it evetually is drying to lips. The more you use it overnight as a lip mask it dries out your lips. I will not be repurchasing this. Nivea does a better job with their hydrating lip balms for $3. SMH @ LANEIGE for $20 it should be plumping and hydrating our lips  better than anything out there!,0.0
This serum smells so earthy and clean and overall refreshing - my skin feels an instant cooling sensation once I put a few drops on. My skin feels hydrated and calm from just one use and I can tell that there are a lot of great active ingredients that are working to heal my skin inside and out. It feels extremely luxurious as well!!,1.0
"I love the scent of this and it feels luxurious to put on, but I am pretty certain it breaks me out, possibly because of the lavender. I also did not notice a high difference in my skin. I used it quite a long time and went through half a bottle before giving up.",0.0
"This product was gifted to me by the brand. The texture is similar to a serum so it’s super lightweight! I didn’t notice a difference in the longevity of my makeup. I feel like it works well under and over makeup, although I prefer wearing it under. It does quickly absorb into the skin and you do feel a softness to the skin as well as a glow.",1.0
"This product is great if you suffer from red skin! It’s a light green but when you go to rub it in it turns a beige and neutralizes the redness. This product is good for all skin types but if you have oily skin like me it definitely adds to my oil production, or at least looks like it does. Very dewy like finish. It almost has a foundation like feel/look. I don’t like that it rubs off easily and is very transferable. It would be nice if they made a version with more of a matte finish because definitely makes your skin look dewy. I would recommend this product for somebody with more combo/dry skin.",1.0
"It gave my lips a greasy feel. Felt like the hydration was gone fast. Didn’t even finish the Treatment, I threw it away. I got halfway through it.",0.0
Wore this alone. It was hydrating and not greasy for my combination skin. Helped fill and mask my pores for a smooth finish. Great citrus smell. I received this product for free for testing purposes.,1.0
"After all the hype from bloggers and beauty influencers surrounding this product I caved and purchased. People were raving about the difference it made in their skin after one bottle. I have purchased two bottles, shame on me, in hopes of seeing these magical results and I got nothing. It is expensive tap water that literally does nothing. Would not recommend and definitely not repurchase",0.0
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster.I will start off by saying this moisturizer is nice. But after having it on your skin for a few minutes it does this weird thing where it dries and then will come off in balls if you run your fingers across your face. It didn’t exactly feel like it was moisturizing but the next day my skin felt soft so I’m very confused about this product. The smell is nice and it feels refreshing. Also you have to work quickly to rub it in because it dries very fast.,0.0
"I received this product to try out and review. It was on the smaller side so I didn’t have enough to use for a long duration of time. From a first impression standpoint, this product was lightweight and absorbed quickly similar to the other Clinique smart repair line. There was a very light scent to this product, but it didn’t irritate my skin. I have always been a fan of Clinique products and recommend if you have sensitive skin.",1.0
"Sometimes I stray, but I always return to this product. Which is unfortunate because it’s a bit spend-y but when it works, it works! I have combination skin and hate the feeling of thick products on my skin. I’ve tried Tatcha’s Dewey Skin Cream and that was too much - I felt as if it never absorbed, just sat atop my skin. The Water Cream is light, but moisturizing. It absorbs quickly, almost spreading like water onto skin and never leaving a film.",1.0
This toner is extremely strong and feels like a ton of peppermint oil which can feel very uncomfortable. The dark spot toner is strong but not nearly as much as this. I recommend the dark spot toner,0.0
"Love the way it smells, but it’s sticky and made my lips dry and chapped.",0.0
"This definitely removed all the makeup from my face... even my eye makeup.  My face felt clean however, my skin did feel tight like the cleanser is too drying.  I don’t feel like it really helped with oil control at all because my skin was still very oily during the day.  I didn’t use the rest of the oil control products in this line and maybe that’s necessary for the full benefit.  It smells really nice too and almost has a nice cooling effect on my skin after I rinse it off... I just don’t think I’ll purchase this again because it didn’t control my oil at all.",0.0
"I received this product complementary for testing purposes.  I was excited to try this out as it received so many rave reviews but for my oily, dehydrated skin, this liquid was too greasy and slick.  It also has a disgusting perfumed scent that is so strong.  I cannot recommend this.",0.0
"I’m not sure why this is such a “cult favorite.“ My skin has been so dry recently from having to wear a mask. I’ve been putting light layers and thick layers of this on my dry patches and wake up to even drier patches than I started with. It feels good upon the first application, but by no means is delivering extended moisture. Save your money and buy any of the La Roche Posay moisturizers from your local pharmacy.",0.0
"This broke me out completely. I did a patch test and didn’t see anything wrong but as soon as I put it on my face, I broke out horribly. It took me 3-4 weeks to get my face back to normal after using this product.",0.0
"I received a sample of this and absolutely loved it. I planned on purchasing it, until I saw the cheap, wasteful packaging. I expected more from such a well respected clean beauty brand. Especially one that is known to use glass containers for other products. Consumers expect a high end, clean item to take its packaging and its impact into consideration. I deducted a star for this reason and also decided not to purchase the item.",0.0
"Nothing special. Simple creamy heavily foaming face wash if that’s what you’re looking for. Didn’t try removing makeup with it, but I’m sure it would be a good first step in make up removal. Product went rancid after just a few months at room temperature, well before it was set to expire in the 12 months after opening. Sephora couldn’t do anything since it was a gift, the beauty rep in store couldn’t do anything - but she referred me to the website, who also couldn’t do anything because I don’t have proof of purchase and it’s been past 30 days. So I’m stuck with a rancid stinky smelly face wash that I need to toss. Don’t recommend - unless you use it before it goes rancid, in a few short months! Does last forever since you only need a tiny bit. It foams/lathers a lot!",0.0
The price is good but this balm leaves a grainy film on my face. Should not be used alone and should be used as part of a double cleanse.,0.0
"I find this product to be drying for my combination skin, even though it smells really good.",0.0
Creamy. Smooth. Smelly like a subtle Japanese cherry blossom.  I wish it has a sub protectant but other than that no large draw back. My skin feels smooth and creamy. It leaves a powder like feel. I received this product form Influenster for free for my unbiased opinion,1.0
Absolutely love love love this product! Smells really good also. It gives a nice glow and kinda feels like my pores look smaller. It just makes my skin feel good.,1.0
"If spoiled milk was a cream, this would be it. It’s a great winter-moisturizer…if it weren’t for the sour smell. The texture is smooth and light and it doesn’t feel heavy on my combination skin. Just wish it didn’t stink.",0.0
"It’s good for the price point. It does it’s job, but it’s not my favorite cleansing balm. I’m almost done with my first bottle, and the whole time I’ve had it, it’s been separated between the oil and the thicker balm part of it. I’m not a fan of the texture for that reason, but that’s the only issue I have with it. I don’t wear heavy makeup, but it’s always been good for me as a makeup and sunscreen remover. It does leave my skin soft too",0.0
"Pendant les 2 premiers jours j’adorais ce produit! Je le trouvait hydratant et diminuait la visibilité des pores. J’ai une peau sèches et très claire, sans boutons et au bout quelques jours plusieurs boutons sont apparut dans mon front..plusieurs bouton jours,plusieurs",0.0
"Seriously this product is amazing!!! I’ve been in at my local Sephora and the guy is always raving about but they never had it in stock. They only ever had the sample/display and I was not going to get a sample from there since you never know who’s hands/fingers have touched that. So my last trip in they finally had it and I was like why not, so I took it home and SERIOUSLY this is AMAZING!!! this stuff worked! not like how makeup wipes take off 3/4 of your makeup casusing you to use another wipe.. No this stuff seriously melts your makeup off! I was too SHOOK that it was all that and a bag of chips! lmao... IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A MAKEUP REMOVER AND A CLEANER BUY THIS***",1.0
"Let me start of by saying this cleansing balm is hands down the best on the market. It blows every other balm out of the water! It removes literally every trace of makeup and then emulsifies completely off with zero residue. It’s also cruelty-free and vegan! However, I will NOT be repurchasing. This contains micro-plastic (polyethylene) which gives the balm it’s solid form but is completely unnecessary (Drunk Elephant Slaai=No polyethylene). It is extremely terrible for marine life and water. Polyethylene is normally too large to penetrate your skin..BUT if you have open acne spots or microtears it can make it’s way into the open skin and into your body. This is NOT A CLEAN INGREDIENT. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!",0.0
"I absolutely love this product! It nourishes my dry, sensitive skin like no other. The Japanese Rice Powder really sets it apart from other products I’ve tried. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and doesn’t irritate at all. I also love that it is Cruelty-Free!I received this product complimentary through Influenster & Tatcha!",1.0
"I have super sensitive skin that is easily prone to redness and irritation. While the concept of having two textures together to mix into a serum was interesting, it did not give me the skin I desired. After seven days of use, I found my skin to look more evenly red toned and also found my skin’s texture to feel rough and dry in my forehead and cheek areas. I’ll easily pass this up for other more affordable products.",0.0
"Thanks, Influenster for the complimentary Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum.  I’ve been using this sample for two weeks and, unfortunately, the only difference I see is the resulting acne.  The texture and feel is just fine and it smells like a multi-vitamin, so I wouldn’t hesitate to use it if I had a large enough sample to see results and it didn’t cause acne.",0.0
"I have tried a couple things from Estée Lauder and some have been good. This youth power crème isn’t what I would like it to be for the price. The first ingredient is water and the second is dimethicone. So, that is what makes up most of the product. I don’t want a silicone filled cream as my skincare. I don’t mind it in makeup at all. In a cream that’s for youthful skin to aid with wrinkles and fine lines should have better ingredients. There is also fragrance and bht as well. In 2022 we all now read the ingredients and aren’t willing to spend our hard earned money on products without proven good ingredients. There are some I like in here but they are overshadowed by the cons. I did try this as a primer with makeup and it worked well for that. As long as you’re okay with fragrance. I just want these high end brands to step it up and do better. We are all reading and learning now with our skincare. If you want to use this as primer you may enjoy it or if you’re okay with mostly silicone in your skincare. This was also the smallest sample ever and I just hoped for more with the product and it’s size.",0.0
"Definitely was extremely smoothing! A very intense scrub, I wouldn’t recommend rubbing too hard as the granules do the exfoliating for you!! Smells amazing too!",1.0

"I received these products for free from Influenster and Tatcha in exchange for my honest review.Holy hydration. This brand new 3-in-1 serum from Tatcha is amazing. My face feels soft and super hydrated with no oily residue left behind. I highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with locking in moisture. I can’t wait to see the results after extended use. I mean, who doesn’t want to smooth out their texture and fine lines, all while plumping and hydrating your skin?",1.0
I really like this serum! The tea smell actually doesn’t bother me and it goes away pretty fast. It gives me a beautiful glow and it hasn’t irritated my skin in the slighted. The texture is also super lightweight!,1.0

"I like the packaging, it’s really elegant and looks really pretty it definitely calls your attention but since I started using this product I don’t feel a complete change, it smells really synthetic and although it serves it purpose and is not harsh to skin at all it’s not a must have. Definitely room for some improvemente in the price/quality range.",0.0
This product smells way better than regular sunscreen it has a citrusy smell to it. I actually really like this project and it stays on for a while which is a plus. I like the stick cause you can just carry it in your bag it doesn’t take up much room. The only downside to this product is it feels a bit oily on my skin.,1.0

"I received a sample of 3 treatments to try this out and tested the first 2 over the course of the past 2 weeks. I was a little nervous because I’m newer to peels but it wasn’t uncomfortable and I’m so impressed at the results! My skin has cleared quite a bit and is left smooth and soft. This is priced far out of my ability to afford something that I don’t actually need, so I likely won’t get it in the future but it was definitely a good experience.",1.0
"This oil cleanser literally worked miracles! My skin was very textured, had a lot of acne scars and was just dull! Within a week of using this product there was noticeable improvements. Definitely would recommend for sensitive skin!",1.0
Got this Facial Mask by @Olehenriksen thru my #voxbox as a #complimentary gift. I’ve been using it and love how it makes my skin feel. It actually minimized my pores with just the one use. It will definitely be a staple piece to my skin care routine.,1.0
Smells like proactive moisturizer and did not do anything really. So glad i got a sample instead of actually purchasing this. It just sat on my skin and made me feel like a greast mess.,0.0
I received this as a free gift through Influenster. I had HIGH expectations from I have read all of the raging reviews and had people personally talk to me about it. I am new to the skincare world so this product was a little intimidating. I used it for about 2 weeks and did not notice much of a difference in my skin texture or brightness. I will continue to use and see!,0.0
looks pretty good but definitely not for oily skin and I wish I knew that. has a very very dewy finish which does not look good on my oily skin,0.0
"My skin loved this cleanser. Using it as the first step in my double-cleansing routine, I squeeze a small amount into my hands and work into a unified paste. Spreading it on my dry skin, the aroma is very comforting, similar to oatmeal and of a relaxing hot tub experience on a snowy mountain top resort. After reminiscing of better childhood memories of the past, I wet my hands and massage my skin some more and rinse away the cleanser. Now, I do agree that there is a bit of “residue“ left over, but with the help of the second cleanser, an ultra-gentle, creamy cleanser, most of the residue is removed and my skin feel great afterwards: smooth and moisturized and the best part, not striped nor in discomfort. I rate this cleanser 5 stars and I will be repurchasing this balm again.",1.0
"I am enjoying using this IT Cosmetics in a Cream.  It goes on very easily on my face and neck, does not leave any residue, has a mild scent, and leaves my face moisturized.  Very creamy without feeling too heavy.  Recommend to others to try.",1.0

"The packaging is cute and I really like that the dispenser stops any kind of contamination. However, this seems like a lot of plastic for .5 oz. With that in mind, I wouldn’t purchase as I am actively trying to be a good steward of the planet.

"Got a very generous sample of this and have been using nightly (and a teeny bit some mornings). Smells really great and makes my lips super smooth, but I don’t feel like it’s HYDRATING my lips.

"Unfortunately this breaks me out in whiteheads. I’ve tried it off and on for a year trying to experiment since it has such great reviews. To me (combo skin, oily t-zone), it is very greasy. I give it two stars because I guess if you have VERY dry skin and absolutely no oil or you really messed up your skin barrier, this could be useful. I keep it around to use if my elbows/heels get dry. Would’ve returned but I waited too long. What a shame.",0.0

I use the oil to remove makeup and do an initial cleanse and follow with the powder which has a light exfoliating effect without causing irritation.My skin looks amazing. I haven’t had a breakout in months.",1.0

This cream is a lifesaver! I have been using it religiously over 2 weeks and I can’t believe what a difference it made on the overall appearance of my skin.

Unfortunately after 3 or 4 uses it gave me a terrible rash, it was burning and itchy in addition to it looking absolutely horrible. I ended up having to go to the doctor to get medication to treat it, and now after a week it is still not completely cleared up. Would not recommend this product at all if you have sensitive skin or are at all prone too rashes.",0.0
The name is confusing it is not a peel you wipe step 1 on face and leave on for a couple of minutes then wipe step 2 on face and leave on so no rinsing required. I have sensitive skin so when I applied skin felt stingy for a few minutes and skin turned red for about 20 minutes so if using will do so only on occasion and not before a special occasion. Did not see much of a difference but only had the small pack and for the cost will probably not purchase especially since skin felt irritated.,0.0

I recently got a sample of this from Sephora due to all the hype and it’s a huge fail for me. I have no idea why this has such great reviews but it’s appalling.

There are so many other great products to spend your money on. I’d skip this one.,0.0

"I had high hopes for this product, but it left my skin feeling greasy in the morning. It applies well and left my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth in the evening, but the morning was a different story. Maybe it was just not the correct product for me.

Shiseido makes the best eye creams around! This cream is heavy enough to help with the bitty wrinkles from living in a dry climate and also light enough to not fall into my under eye lines. It help with the overtired look I normally have from lack of sleep and helped with my early crows feet. It doesn’t give the pep like Clinique’s pepstart under eye in that orange tube but I’ve aged out of their lightweight formula and need the big guns.,1.0
"I was hesitant to order this because of some of the negative reviews. But I’ve been using this for about a week now, twice a day and I have 100% noticed a difference in my skin. I get really bad post acne hyperpigmentation and I definitely can already see the spots fading. One thing you gotta remember about products is that everyone’s skin is different so just because one product doesn’t work for one person, doesn’t mean it work for you. I have combo, acne prone skin that recently leans towards the dryer side and I don’t think I want to try any other oil again after this one.",1.0
"There is nothing gradual about this product.  I was light last night and woke up patchy Orange and brown pattern.   Mind you, I regularly exfoliate and followed the application instructions.   Returning immediately and I take my 28 showers to get rid of this color pattern of awfulness.    Advice, get some good sunscreen and get yourself a tan the good old fashion way.  Please note that I did purchase the correct tone, my skin tone is naturally olive and tan very easily. Buyer beware. Currently on Amazon right now ordering a tanning remover.  Oh boy!!!!!!!!!!!",0.0
I wanted to love this because hello anti aging and it said it brightens. I got a sample as a cub reward  I usually use purity face wash. Every time I wash my face with this it gets in my mouth I have no clue how but it’s so gross and then I can’t get the taste out. It also burns my eyes. I’m trying g to finish the sample but I don’t even think it’s worth it,0.0
"I got a sample bottle of this in a Sephora Play Smarts box, along with a sample tube of Good Genes. I was initially a little skeptical and wondered if the Sunday Riley thing was a bunch of hype, but I changed my mind pretty quickly. This is one of the few products I’ve used where I could see results pretty immediately after use. When I awoke the next day, my skin felt plump, healthy, and soft. It also seemed brighter in a subtle way. I’m 41 and have a few fine lines, but I don’t suffer from major skin problems or sun damage, so I only use this oil a few times a week in conjunction with Good Genes. Although it is a facial oil, I will say that is incredibly lightweight and soaks in very quickly. A little goes a long way, so if I have to invest in the smaller size bottle for $55, I think I can get a lot of mileage out of it. As an aside, I know some people dislike the blue tansy smell, but I really like that mixed with chamomile...it makes for a soothing night scent. I highly recommend giving this a try if you can find a sample.",1.0
Dried my face out and the bottle made it really hard to get the product out.,0.0
"I love how this product is clean, and has a mild odour. The texture is very pleasant too, but my sensitive, combination skin broke out after one use; I woke up with a breakout where I used the product. I’ll go back to my usual Tatcha Water Cream, which is at a comparable price point. I forget if this was a bonus offer or a 100 point item, but I’m glad I had the sample.",0.0
"I love this product it works really well and for someone who’s skin breaks out a lot, I have not had my skin break out. I have combination skin, age 39 and this product has not made me break out and I see that my skin is more plump. The only thing that I do not like about this product is the packaging. The pump up method of retrieving the product seems like it would be a waste when you get to the end of the product. I like to scrape every last bit of the jar when it’s towards the bottom and you can’t do that with this packaging. Unfortunately I will have to keep looking for another moisturizer that the packaging is also good. Please change the packaging!!!",1.0
"This is the one step I can’t skip for my daily skincare routine. Even when I’m extremely exhausted, I force myself to put this on before I fall asleep. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, evens out most of my surface texture, and eradicates almost all of my redness (the minor exception would be if I’m having an eczema flare up, but it will still minimize the redness). I normally don’t buy skincare products as gifts, but I think I’ll be ordering several as gifts this holiday season.",1.0
"Loved the feel of this on my skin. It absorbed very nicely and didn’t leave me feeling greasy. A little goes a very long way, which is also nice considering the price. Price being my main reason for the deduction in rating. Overall I feel I did notice an improvement in my skin’s texture and suppleness. I would recommend this product if you can afford it. I received a sample for testing purposes.",1.0
I absolutely love this lightweight cream! It is so silky and going on smooth. A little but goes a long way so this will last for awhile. I would recommend this product for all skin types. It is so hydrating but doesn’t feel greasy or oily. I love it!,1.0
"I give this 4 stars because it does what it’s supposed to do, but it’s nothing extraordinary. It moisturizes and it doesn’t make me breakout, so I’m happy, especially considering the price. This is also one of the products recommended by The Ordinary as something to mix their niacinamide powder with, so if you use that, it’s a great option for you.",1.0
"I am currently on Accutane so my skin is so dry, especially my lips. I have to put on lip balm every 30 minutes with only partial relief. I received this as a sample from my trip to sephora and had INSTANT relief. I will be buying it as soon as my sample us out.",1.0
I have bought so many moisterizers and none of them worked for my dry skin. this one is incredible. Put it on at night and let it sink in while you sleep and wake up with super soft and moisturized skin.,1.0
"I absolutely love this product. I use it to melt my makeup and follow with the cantelope Drunk Elephant cleanser. This product also easily melts my waterproof mascara and a little goes a long way. At first, I was adamant in trying the oil but instead got the balm because it was on sale. I have no regrets but would be interesting to see how the oil is different",1.0
Definitely worth the money. I’ve had this product for a long time and I still haven’t run out. Lasts long! I put it on before I go to sleep and my lips feel so soft in the morning. Definitely recommend!,1.0
"The Drops warm up my skin in a very natural way. I use them as part of my morning routine for some added color. On both non-makeup and makeup days - layers well with my skincare and makeup. I shake the bottle, then squeeze a tiny drop (comes out dark but sheers out) into my Lala Retro Whipped Cream for a tinted moisturizer that subtly gives instant color.",1.0
"Decent mask — it’s hydrating, but I’m not a huge fan of the slightly minty scent. It does the trick but I have other masks and creams I prefer over this one.",1.0
If you have sensitive skin I would say proceed with caution. I use this more as a spot treatment now instead of everywhere. I also had a “purging” period when I first started using this product. It does work but takes some time. It works but wasn’t as magical is people say.,0.0
"I have really sensitive skin that gets cystic acne  fairly easily. My face had just started to settle down through using some of the other products from this lone in my regimen. Since the other products worked so well, I hoped to use this one to increase plumpness and prevent wrinkles.

Now I have to start over again with repairing my skin (I get hyperpigmentation very badly as well)!",0.0
"I recieved this product free from influesnster, and I was really suprised by this product! I love the way the product feels... It isn’t sticky or tacky! It doesn’t have a smell to it...

"After washing it off at the end of the day, it seemed like I had a lot more whiteheads. Doesn’t really work for darker skin tones! Leaves a grayish look instead. Worked for my redness but it looked bad under my foundation and looked a bit cakey. Doesn’t work great with primer either.",0.0
"I like this serum as long as it is used as it is directed to be used. It is intended to be mixed with other products, like Protini for example, to get the best effect. I have even tried it with other brands. It works well to provide extra hydration when mixed. As a stand alone product, I do not find it to provide as much benefit, so I absolutely recommend mixing. I received this product complimentary for testing.",1.0
"This is a very moisturizing cream and if you have very dry skin it would probably work wonders. However, I found it sat on top of my skin creating a sticky texture eventually leaving an oily feeling, but that being said I feel like this would be better used in the winter when my skin needs the extra moisture versus summer. I also found it smelt like a towel that was left in the wash to long which unfortunately is bad enough that I would probably never buy it in a full sized product.",0.0
I think I might be the odd one out but I do not like this product. I find that the cleanser is breaking me out when I use it on its own. I have oil cleansed for years and this is just not as good as some traditional oils I have used for much cheaper.,0.0
"I have sensitive acne prone skin and this doesn’t aggrevate it at all. Yes, you can still see redness from acne/ some acne scars after this, but it is certainly less noticeable. It is very oily/shiny looking when on my skin, but if I blot it after letting it settle for 15 min that goes away. It does cling to dry patches/ rough skin and make it more obvious so exfoliate well before using. It also settles into the fine dynamic wrinkle under my eyes, but I just smooth it out every few hours. It definitely makes my skin a shade lighter, but I just smooth some down my neck so it doesn’t look odd. Might be a problem for medium-to-dark skin tones though since I am very pale.",1.0
So far I’ve been using The Essence for about 2 weeks and have used it about 7-8 times before bed. I am already noticing brighter skin!

"first, I love this brands face cleaner and I’m almost done with my 2nd bottle so why not try this exfoilator? the first couple times I used it and nothing happened. My skin felt the same and I didn’t break out. I just used this again a few days ago and my entire face feels like sandpaper! I don’t leave this product on after I’m done gently rubbing because I do have sensitive skin. The first couple of uses there weren’t any issues and now I feel like my face can go sand a clay pot. I have been trying to moisturize and I even used a Tatcha face mask but nothing is working. My foundation is just soaking into it and you can see all the rough patches all over my face. Seriously I have no idea what to do.",0.0

"This cream is very rich but has not caused any breakouts on my somewhat sensitive skin.  I recently over-exfoliated my skin and it became irritated, so I used this cream at bedtime and by morning, my skin had calmed down and felt hydrated and super-soft.  I don’t ever want to be without Omega Repair now, especially in winter - it’s a must-have for cold, dry climates.",1.0

"I normally use Clinique’s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion because it’s a nice basic moisturizer that doesn’t break me out, but it wasn’t quite hydrating enough, so I decided to try this one out. When I first used it, I woke up to little bumps ALL over my face, which has never happened to me before. I think it might have been a reaction to the eucalyptus oil (which gives off a pretty strong scent). I kept using the moisturizer, and the bumps did go away after about 1-2 weeks. But I don’t know why a product marketed for sensitive skin would have essential oils in it - they can be irritating to a lot of people, especially those with sensitive skin.I use this cream after my Laneige Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer because the cream is very thick and doesn’t penetrate deeply into my skin. It’s fine, and I will use it up because I don’t like wasting products, but I definitely won’t be repurchasing this.",0.0
"I’ve been using this cleanser for a while now, and it’s incredible! It’s great at removing sebum and buildup without over stripping the skin. If you’re interested in this product, I would definitely give it a try.",1.0
"I loved this cleanser because it took off my make up so well and really love fresh beauty products (I use the lotus youth preserve face cream every day). I bought this because of the popularity and trust in the brand, but for some reason I realized that this had been the new product I was using that was breaking my face out. From what I’ve read from other reviewers it seems like this was common if you have dry skin. I stopped using it and kept everything else that I normally use the same and my face isn’t breaking out anymore. Again it was a great cleanser to take off make up and really make my face feel clean, but obviously the breakouts weren’t ideal. I’d recommend getting a sample first if you’re considering or the smaller size (glad that’s what I usually get when trying a new skincare product). Anyways, I’m giving the rest to a friend who loves this and doesn’t break out from using it.",0.0
"I wanted to love this product. It smells and feels fantastic, applies smoothly, and washes off cleanly. But after using this followed by a gel cleanser, a toner-soaked cotton pad still picks up dirt and makeup from my face. I simply can’t use a face cleanser that doesn’t clean my face.",0.0
"I agree with the others, this is a poor bottle design. The product itself didn’t improve my oily skin. I broke out immediately using the product.",0.0

"These acne dots are amazing! They stick on well and don’t fall off. I usually put these on before bed and they draw out all the nasty gunk by the time I wake up. Really makes a difference in getting rid of a zit faster. The patches reduce the size of the zit and I’ve also noticed that I’ve been getting fewer acne scars than I did before, possibly due to the fact that these patches keep me from touching my zits and infecting them further. Overall, I think they’re very effective despite being a little pricey.",1.0
I received this product for free for my honest review. I will say I want to love this but I don’t as much as I love the Aqua bomb by them ! I don’t feel like this lasts up to 26 hours maybe 2 where as the aqua bomb definitely had me feeling glowing for longer !  I do like how it applies and that there is definitely no scent !,1.0

This face oil smells lovely in an essential oil way which I can see some people liking. However I’m not a fan of essential oils in skincare as it can cause reactions in people. Goes on skin almost matte with a hint of healthy glow. Subtle and beautiful. It’s ok if you’re fine with essential oils and caprylic triglycerides but those definitely put me off this.,0.0
"This was okay for a facial moisturizer. For reference I have acne prone, combination skin. Upon application everything was moisturized and all was well till a few hours later. Around my nose was dry again and my face just didn’t feel like when I first put it on. It didn’t take care of any dryness. This may work for someone who has more well behaved skin than I do. On the positive side it is fragrance free and the jar is adorable. The cream itself is on the thick side but smooths over the face without tugging. I wish it worked for me :(",0.0

A little if this product goes a long way, so make sure you only use a little bit - otherwise it will be greasy and won’t absorb properly",1.0

I also developed a reaction as my face turn red as soon as I apply it. I kept using it as I thought is was hormonal, but now I am dealing with huge clogged pores and breakout. I think it may be too rich, I will keep it as an occasional night cream. Will see how it goes.",0.0
This was my first time trying Sunday Riley products and I’m hooked! I’ve been using the Luna Oil and Good Genes at least once a day for a month and I have seen a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.

Love this moisturizer. Only thing I’ve found that is hydrating enough in winter but doesn’t break me out (I battle combination acne prone skin that gets scaly and cracked in the cooler months). Feel improved texture in skin with consistent bedtime use. I saw lots of reviewers talking about a negative odor but it doesn’t bother me. It smells a little strange during application but it quickly goes away and it’s a tradeoff I’m willing to take because I love how my skin feels. One of my favorite skin care products!,1.0

I have been using this product for about a month now and I have not noticed any significant changes in the appearance of my skin. I have oily combo skin (oily forehead and t zone and dry or normal skin on my cheeks) and it is still the same.

This product did nothing for me so i am super disappointed because everyone seems to love this rosehip oil.,0.0
"This mask has a very refreshing feeling when being applied, so I can see why its purpose is to be used on flights. After applying it, my face felt very hydrated. Since I wasn’t on a flight, I applied this as an overnight mask. It was quick sticky even after an hour of application. Upon waking up, it was not as sticky. However, it could’ve been due to transference. I also saw no visible difference in my skin, but remember that everyone’s skin is different! Overall, I cannot recommend this since I saw no affect.",0.0
Cleansing balms are my jam. This balm melts off all of my makeup but I find it can sometimes leave a small filmy residue depending on how dry my skin is. I’ll use a second cleanser afterwards and having this residue seriously helps with preventing that tight feeling I can get from even the most gentle of face washes. The double cleansing method has seriously saved my dry sensitive skin. It hasn’t broken me out yet but may not be suitable for acne-prone skin. The packaging is seriously the star of the show. The added Bamboo Booster is great for when ur lips get seriously dry but I personally wouldn’t use it on your face if you have sensitive skin as it may be too abrasive. If you have acne-prone skin I’d use the Pharmacy’s Green Clean cleansing balm as it doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy afterwards.,1.0

"I switched for this because of the “ phobia “ generated around skincare that contains alcohol. I was doing quite well with Tarte Knockout for even skin tone and pore size control. I have normal oily combo skin. Was very pleased with that Tarte Knockout Tingling toner. Used this for a full year. I can definitely atest to it’s inefficiency in helping pore size stay at minimum, no glowy feeling skin like before, dullness and insufficient exfoliating power. My make up didn’t look as good all during the time I used this. But I was going with the “ no alcohol “ moviment and ended up setting back my skin wasting a year on this over hyped product. Of Tarte Knockout is too strong for you I started years ago with the Climique ones. Both better than this product.",0.0
I was starting to notice fine lines around my my eyes and was previously only using a moisturizing eye serum. Switched to this and love it! the lines have disappeared.

I love the smell and was really excited about this product but it’s more of a makeup remover than cleanser. I would not recommend nor purchase it again.

It’s expensive for what you get.,0.0
I really wanted to love this product as everyone loves it. The smells smells like fermented celery. Which is a huge turn off. It also leaves a weird film as if it’s a mask.

"I enjoyed the glow I had the next morning from this mask, I did not enjoy the smell as much.

I received these as a sample from Sephora. I had high hopes but all it did was gave me a free waxing on my forehead and left a crater where the zit was. It peeled off the head on the zit and bled. I’d include a pic but it is just gross so I shall not. Definitely not for me!,0.0
"I got this a few months ago because I wanted something really moisturizing and nourishing for the winter and I’ve heard good things about this one so I tried it. It worked well for a bit, my skin wasn’t dry but it just looked okay. But recently my face has started burning after putting it on. It looks like I have chemical burns.",0.0

Love the natural ingredient! Did not break out and have used two bottles already!",1.0
"I saw Huda’s video on this product and thought I HAD to get it. The price is yikes! But I used my rewards and made the price look better. So I tried this product a few different ways. First and foremost,, BEWARE, It comes out fiarly easy so be gentle! I overdid my first squeeze! ha. I could feel it gently exfoliating BUT the little balls felt more like the formula and not so much my dead skin. I didn’t feel glowy but I felt like I had product on after I rinsed, like a layer on top of my skin, which made it feel softer but I felt like my skin didn’t soak up my serums or moisturizer afterwards. It didn’t really affect my skin the days after. I have been using it twice a week (third week now), when I do my facial time. So the second time I used it, I put in on BEFORE I double cleansed and I actually felt like that prepped my skin better. I felt more cleansed and my skin soaked up my serum and moisturizer better. Third try I cleansed, left my face slightly damp, then I used the enzyme scrub. I felt like that was THE best way to use this product. I could feel my skin being exfoliated and THEN the product started balling up and felt more like dead skin. BUT still for me, I wish I felt more of that soft, glowy feel in the days to follow. The day of, feels great but that’s it, for me at least. I won’t be purchasing this product again. The price just doesn’t reflect what the product claims to fix.",0.0

"I’ve never used Korres before. Right off the bat, I’m not a huge fan of scented skincare or grapes in general. I do feel like it does a good job of hydrating but do not use it when you’re going to put on makeup. It made my foundation pill up. I did not notice it doing anything for my pores because they were still very visible. So for me, it’s just an ok product that I wouldn’t purchase because there’s other that work better for me *Product received complimentary from Influenster and Korres for testing purposes*",0.0

"I picked this moisturizer up when a rep said it would be good for dry skin. She obviously never used it personally. While the texture is thick, it doesn’t spread well. I need to “warm” up this product with my hands first and still it doesn’t have enough slip. For this price, I expect a more luxurious texture. In terms of hydration, it’s also a miss. Though the cream can leave a layer of product, it doesn’t seem to penetrate deeply enough to appropriately hydrate. There are much better options for hydration, especially at this price point. I would not recommend or repurchase.",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product. I have olive skin but in the Canadian winter I get very pale and was looking for a pick me up. When it arrived it didn’t look all the way full and there were dark spots turning in the pipette. I don’t know if they all look like this or mine was defective? Anyway I gave it a shot. The first time I used it I only put 2 drops into my moisturizer before bed and woke up with a slight glow - very subtle but there. My hands were quite stained but face didn’t look blotchy. A few days later it was completely faded so again at night I added an extra drop (3 total) to my moisturizer. Woke up with awful acne and a barely tan face. My palms however are rusty orange and have been for several days!!If you use very sparingly and don’t have acne prone skin this product might work great, but unfortunately it’s a no from me. Will be returning.",0.0

"I am a total skincare junkie. Maybe even more so than makeup. I am 35, have dry skin, and I am fighting the first signs of aging. I love this anti-aging moisturizer. It does not give the velvety feel to your skin that lala does, however, I find that using this twice a day in addition to hyaluronic acid from “The Ordinary” definitely does allow me to maintain my moisture levels, even in the winter. But what I really love about this, is the anti-aging effects. It definitely does make my skin appear more plump, firm, and smooth. It’s exactly what I was hoping for in a moisturizer. One that goes beyond simple moisturizing. And this does. I think if you are currently fighting dry and scaly patches, this may not be enough for you, but if you already have those effectively managed, this is a great addition to your skincare routine. It works fine under my makeup and does not pill or cause my makeup to break apart. Thank you again DE! And yes, I realize it is expensive, but I’d say this one is worth the splurge if you are looking for the same benefits I was.",1.0
"My favourite thing about the product is the packaging. It’s quite visually appealing I love it aesthetically! I also love the commitment to sustainability. Otherwise, I find the fragrance overwhelming, I’d prefer it milder or not there at all. It makes my face a bit red after I apply it, maybe I’m a bit sensitive to the fragrance. I also don’t find it any better than any other less expensive face oil. I received this product complimentary for the purpose of review.",0.0

I have wanted to try this Charlotte tilbury cream for a long time.  It’s so luxurious and makes my skin feel amazing. I use it at night and wake up with such soft skin. You can still feel it after you wash your face. My makeup goes on beautifully as well.  I highly recommend this!,1.0

"This primer is amazing in the liquid form. It smooths my skin and does not ball up or flake prior to applying my foundation. My only complaint is how difficult it was to open the container to try to use up lots of leftover product. I literally had to break the very hard plastic bottle with a hammer to get to it! It shouldn’t be so difficult to get something like this open. For this reason I may have to look for another primer, I hate knowing there is wasted product that will be thrown away. Plus, I don’t find the packaging to be environmentally friendly.",0.0

"High hopes for this but it’s a no for me. At 39 a $90 sleeping mask has to really perform for me to purchase it. It’s a nice texture, pleasant smell and easy to apply.

I am not sure i like it. It does not behave well with other products. It tends to peel off. also it does have a bit of a white cast on me. I did wear it on the beach all over my body and it worked better that way but for the price I would purchase something else,0.0
"Expensive but worth it! I would never buy anything this expensive; but was so happy to get a sample for free from Pinchme! I used this over the course of a week and while I will say it definitely made a difference; I truly cant constitute spending this much on a product that doesnt have long lasting effects. Dont get me wrong, this would be a perfect product for people who may suffer from extreme acne or oily skin; but it just doesnt do enough for me to justify the price.",0.0
I am shook!! This exfoliator is so amazing. I am officially in love. I did not expect for this to be as great as it is. My skin instantly felt amazing and looked even better. It felt so soft and hydrated. This is a must have. I have never tried anything like it!,1.0
Good everyday gentle cleanser for normal/dry skin. Does not irritate or cause breakouts. Smells nice. Just wish it had a pump.,1.0
This is a great cleansing balm!! Especially when double cleaning and for melting away makeup! I love applying it to my face while being dry as it quickly melts into my skin with this silky consistency. It has no scent which is nice if you have a sensitivity to fragrance. It’s also great cleansing with this balm alone. It keeps my skin feeling hydrated!,1.0
"I’m kinda bummed about this mask. I got a sample of this with an order and I immediately loved it- it felt so great and hydrating on my face. I recommended it to a couple friends even. Once I bought the bigger size and started using it more often, my skin became more dry. So I started using it during the day and at night hoping it would help. But, I believe it was the product actually drying out my skin. I quit using it for a few days and my skin is more hydrated now. The mask seems to only work initially and then has the opposite effect of drying out the skin more. I’m giving 3 stars bc I really did love it at first and it did not break me out. However, I will be saving the rest of it until it gets a little warmer out and my skin isn’t so dry.",0.0

"Holy moly. So I have a skin/joint condition that makes me scar very easy, leaving me with ice-pick scars from acne, and stretch marks everywhere from just growing. This noticably plumps my skin, and reduces the look of my scars in ways I’ve never had any other product do before. I had some left over from applying to my face, so I rubbed it on my shoulders, and could see with the naked eye how a concave scar plumped up to match the height of the rest of my skin.$7 bucks and it instantly did more for a problem it doesn’t even advertise helping with than tens of other products I’ve tried charging quadruple the amount.This must be the stuff they put in the pods in sci-fi movies to preserve astronauts in hibernation on long voyages.",1.0
"This is the first moisturizer that I’ve actually loved and bought a second bottle of. I really feel this moisturizer hydrating my skin. I have combo/oily skin so I was unsure if this would be too heavy but it actually works great. Even in summer when it’s hot and humid, I have found the cream to be great on my combo skin. Was debating whether I should try YTTP’s lightweight moisturizer but I’m already in love with this one :)",1.0

It has the texture of hair gel, and even though it’s silicone free it feels like you’re spreading hair gel all over your face. It does not sink in, and does not hydrate, it made my skin feel irritated and more dry than before I put it on. Not a fan.",0.0
influenced to buy it but big mistake this moisturizer hardly does anything. It does smell good but that’s probably all it has going for it. If you like glow recipe i’d probably recommend the plum moisturizer over this one,0.0
So I was very excited to get this product after reading all the great reviews. I do have larger size pores so that was my main reason buying it.It does definitely give you that nice glass complexion my only problem is it does not completely absorb in my skin and It actually rubs off in a flaky texture. Not sure why. So disappointed! :(I wish Sephora didn’t give you a section after writing a review if you would recommend it or not. I don’t want to say yes and I don’t want to say no but unfortunately my circumstance I have to check no. It might just be my skin.,0.0

It’s pretty thick, so you don’t need much. I love how it feels and looks when I put it on before bed, and the morning after my first use, I was like, “WOW!“ For some reason, though, it was just that first application that really impressed me. It’s been a week and I’ve noticed it’s been clumping up overnight and my lips haven’t looked THAT hydrated in the morning. Perhaps I’ll give it a few more days, though at this point I’m leaning toward my drugstore overnight lip treatment.",0.0
"It definitely has some good ingridients especially if you have sensitive skin BUT honestly as a person that works out 3-4 times a week, after showering after a workout, my face never feels fully clean when using this cleanser. It’s to ... gentle? That’s why I’m assuming it’s meant for only sensitive skin. If you want something that actually cleans your pores deep down I suggest looking elsewhere especially if you sweat a lot because all that does ever sully build up if Not cleansed properly. It’s a good brand but I won’t purchase this again, I’ll try something else",0.0
I got a sample of from Sephora and it’s just alright. I do feel like it exfoliates the skin and it’s definitely not as strong as other acid toners I’ve used in the past like the Tarte Knockout and the GlamGlow Supertoner. I think it’s in the nice middle spot where it’s not too gentle but you still feel like it does something. The reason why I don’t really like it and I won’t be purchasing a full size version of this is because it feels soapy on the skin. When I put it on a cotton pad it kind of feels like a surfactant which is very strange to me and I don’t like that feeling. Your probably thinking maybe you have residual cleanser on your face but i only use this toner once a day and I always cleanse my face in the shower to make sure that I throughly wash my cleanser of my face so I don’t really know why I get that soapy texture on my skin I just know I don’t like it and this is a pass for me.,0.0
"I decided to treat myself after hearing rave reviews from a friend and I can personally say, for me, it has been well worth the purchase!

This is truly one of my all time favorite products. I’ve been a fan of dermalogica for a long time and this has changed up my entire routine.

The best part about this product is that it never OVER exfoliates so you never have to worry about it creating more dryness. Definitely recommend.,1.0

It’s not my favorite product...I wouldn’t say it is worth the price, but I do like it while I have it. Probably won’t buy this again.",0.0

"I received this product complimentary to give an honest review.  I have use and loved products from this brand before and I appreciate that it’s a clean brand because I’ve been trying to utilize more clean products on myself and in my makeup kit.  Lately I have been working long hours in the heat so my skin hasn’t been looking its best. I like the vacuum sealed, airtight pump packaging. The creamy, rich texture does have a little bit of a scent to it, but it didn’t bother me. After a couple of minutes of application I did feel a tingly sensation, but nothing to the effect of a sting or burn. It was refreshing. After washing it off I didn’t see any drastic effects. My skin still had some redness to it, no noticeable difference in pore size or skin texture.  But that was just the first immediate try.  I will update this review after a few more applications for a more in depth, long term use.",0.0
"So I bought this because my housemate RAVED about it after trying it out herself & I have I got say WOW~ Just with one use I immediately noticed a difference on my face. I ended up using this daily morning & evening after cleansing during my skincare routine and I just could not stop being impressed. As someone who struggles with big pores, aging skin and visible texture, using this has greatly increased my confidence in my skin.",1.0
Such an amazing product. My face has never looked so clear.,1.0
"I got this because I was on a budget and couldn’t exactly afford my usual moisturizer. I should have just waited instead of settling for this. Not only did it break me out, it made me so oily. My skin did not absorb any of this cream, it just sat on my face, and it felt uncomfortable too.",0.0
ITS THE BEST!!! I received this in small container for testing purposes and a little goes a long way and the grains are so small I really feel like it exfoliates my skin. I know that once my tester turns out this is something I won’t be able to live without. Sooo recommend!,1.0
"Burned intensely, face was red and swollen after use. I couldn’t keep it on longer than 5 minutes. I LOVE Drunk Elephant products but this just wasn’t for me :(. I know many other people love this product, and I’ll give it a break because I could have just been allergic to something in it. I wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin.",0.0
"This balm works well for softening my lips and goes on nice and smooth. I love that it doesn’t feel waxy or sticky. It sinks into the lips quickly so I use it many times throughout the day. It really helps my dry lips. The only drawback is that the stick is so big. I don’t know why they made it that wide, it would be easier to apply if it were smaller. I don’t think it was different enough from other products out there to justify being almost $20.",0.0
I ignored bad reviews to try it for myself but i just left me with breakouts every time I used it. I would even stop for a while and try again but I just wouldn’t recommend this for sensitive skin I really wanted to like this but I think it just has too much fragrance:(,0.0
"I was skeptical about this moisturizer just because I felt like Tatcha had really been stepping up their advertising over the past year among beauty gurus and the public so I wasn’t sure if all of the positive reviews had been because of that. After buying the mini and then buying the full size, I can say that for me it is definitely worth it if you are willing to spend the money. There are still great moisturizers and dupes out there if you are on a budget, but nothing I’ve tried is exactly like this water cream. It does come with a small spatula so you can scoop out the product to be a little more sanitary, or you can be like me and just dip your hands in because you’re too impatient and not boujee enough to use it. You really do only need a dime sized amount to moisturize your face. So the mini ended up lasting me 1.5 weeks with it being used twice a day. The normal size looks like it will last me around 5-7 weeks. This moisturizer makes your skin so smooth and soft. You can definitely tell the difference the next morning if you apply it at night and my skin feels great throughout the day when applied in the morning. Only thing I will say is that it is borderline greasy if you apply too much, especially around the T-zone.",1.0
Lightweight and quick absorbing this moisturizer has quickly become a favorite. Leaves my skin nourished and well hydrated plus has a nice scent. Wears well under makeup and makes my skin look plump and fresh. Gifted.,1.0
This stuff did melt my makeup but then I had to double cleanse AFTER to get the balm off.  It is very greasy and i would have to use a makeup removing cloth and a cleanser to get the greasy slip off. I like cleansing balms and oils but I ended up tossing this because it was so frustrating to use.,0.0

"It says Fragrance Free which is true but it STINKS! It smells like a dead animal or that awful smell of raw unfiltered lanolin. I am dreading using it due to the smell. I’ve only used it once, I hope it performs well otherwise. If I can’t stand the smell, I’ll have to return it. I did like the consistency though and that it’s fast absorbing.",0.0
"I received a free sample of dr. Dennis gross’ alpha beta extra strength daily peel in exchange for my honest review. It worked really well at refreshing my skin after the summer took its toll on my skin, causing a few dark spots. It definitely sloughed off the layer of dry skin after a few uses, leaving my skin looking brighter. It did dry my skin out a bit, however, so I would recommend using with a good moisturizer",1.0
I meaaan.. at least they don’t burn your eyes like some heavily fragranced ones tend to do. I just wish they took my makeup off w/o trying so hard. Like I feel like the garnier charcoal wipes take it all off with ease but yes these do smell good (not too powerful of a scent) but I’d buy these again if only I didn’t struggle that much with removing my makeup. That should be an easy process idk why these give me such a hard time especially w eyeliner and pigmented shadows!,0.0
Emphasis on primer! This is the perfect spf / primer for anyone with problem skin it glides on like a silky luxury primer I haven’t burned while using it so I’m putting my stamp of approval on the spf purpose. It definitely helps hide the texture on my skin it helps my make up hang on to flaky post break out areas and has become my new go to. It’s clear so no white cast and it does not pill up with my other skin care products (creams oils and serums).,1.0
I love to use this toner every other night with The Ordinary Rose Hip Seed Oil. I wouldn’t recommend mixing it with other acids like the Lactic Acid.,1.0
Absorbs alright. Not special here. Moisture wasn’t sealed and skin would get dry through the day. Eventually my skin started compensating and overproducing oil. Had to use a real moisturizer for a few weeks to correct this. Would use if nothing else were available.,0.0
* I received this product free from @influenster & @sundayriley in exchange for my honest review* I really love the packaging it is super cute and catches the eye. The smell if super nice (if you love the smell of oranges). The product went on very smoothly and you really don’t need much. It left a glowy finish on my skin. I have very sensitive skin but it hasn’t broken me out and it felt very soothing when I put it on. It is a higher price point but may be something I implement into my skin care routine!,1.0
"I will start this review off by saying that I really don’t have any major issues as far as my undereyes go. I have some dryness but otherwise dark circles and fine lines are not a problem for me, therefore, I cannot really speak as to whether this product helps with those concerns. It is a nice cream that isn’t too heavy and applies and absorbs well. I don’t notice any real brightening effect with this. All in all, I don’t think there is anything special about this eye cream. It is just OK. I do recommend using it at night because when I have tried it in the mornings under my makeup, it never seems to sit right right under my concealer. I feel like my concealer and under eye powders look more dry or cakey on the days when I have used this eye cream. So, I prefer to use it at night after I have removed all my makeup.",0.0

"First, I would like to mention that I received this product complementary from Influenster about a month ago to test out. So far, I’ve used it every other night around my eyes, mouth and forehead. Places that wrinkle the most. I love how lightweight and hydrating it feels. Works well with my nightly routine and other serums. It smells really nice but not overpowering. I can’t speak for the fast repair or youth generating power, but it did make my skin feel nice. Ill definitely be purchasing a bottle to try for a longer period of time. #esteelauder #advancednightrepair #influenster #voxbox #free",1.0
Ended up returning it after a few days. Had the worst rancid oil smell made my stomach flip in the worst way. Ended up breaking out super bad from it too. Was not a fan. Even the Sephora employee agreed that it smelled super bad.,0.0
I have extremely sensitive skin and will break out with anything that doesn’t agree with it. Fortunately with this product I didn’t have a single break out and I’ve been using it for about a month now. I have combo skin but during the winter in very dry and lately I’ve been waking up with my skin looking super hydrated and vibrant. I def recommend this to anyone looking for a good overnight moisturizer that will help you wake up looking great.,1.0
This is a great product and smells really good. I have oily skin and it didn’t affect it. I use it as a regular face cream and it’s nice!,1.0
This product is pretty pricey but I think it is worth it. After 2-3 uses I saw a huge difference in my skin.,1.0
I put this on at night when I have breakouts and in the morning my skin is noticeably better.,1.0
The liquid mild face soap is okay. It didn’t dry out my face or break me out. It did a decent job removing minimal makeup. However the smell this cleanser has is very chemically. It doesn’t have any extra benefits from using this cleanser unlike others. I just find it too basic for my liking.,0.0

"I first got this as a trial for my birthday gift from sephora and i loved how it feels when using it so i bought the regular size (i switch from clinuque’s cleanser to this one) and after using it for a while i noticed that every after i use it, it made my skin feels dry. my skin is normal but my tzone is a little bit oily and this product made me break out a lot. I still use it sometimes but not as much anymore.",0.0

I don’t know what lax marketing rules allow Supergoop to say this is reef safe when it contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene. All of these are extremely harmful to our reefs and oceans. So disappointed and will not be purchasing.",0.0
Not sure why no one is mentioning the smell here.. It smells like mold growing on top of rusted metal. I had high hopes for it because the price per amount and the glow it gives skin but the smell is in tolerable that I will be returning,0.0
As a person with combination skin it can be difficult to find a moisturizer that’s occlusive but not heavy. This moisturizer is lightweight and sinks in quickly. It has a light scent that lingers so if you’re sensitive to fragrance this may not be for you but I found it pleasant. You can feel the dimethicone in the product which I find works well under makeup as it smoothes your skin’s texture and leaves a slight sheen.,1.0
Tried this in conjunction with the find the toner and moisturizer. I haven’t seen an improvement in my oil throughout the day but it also hasn’t gotten worse.,0.0
"Disappointing. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Like others, I bought the mini and also received a half-full jar. Texture is not horrid, feels like smearing peanut butter on your face. Because it’s brown, I can’t tell if it’s actually reducing my redness or just covering it ip.",0.0
Absolutely phenomenal. Thats it. Theres nothing else to say.,1.0

"I love this product, it leaves my skin beautiful, I can’t be without it since I met it. I look beautiful and at the same time I take care of my skin since it has sun protection and in addition to that it helped hydrate my skin",1.0
"It’s not bad. It’s very hydrating and it gives a nice glow to the skin BUT, it’s way too oily (and I love oily stuff), the fragrance is strong, it stings my eyes, and the UV filters are not the best in the world. It has an elegant formula but there are other better sunscreens that may cost less. I don’t hate it but having sensitive/combination skin, it wasn’t the most pleasant sunscreen I’ve ever used (and I like glowy/hydrating sunscreens!). Even for a dry skin could be too much. It’s like it never sets. It was nice trying it and I’ll finish it. But I’m not sure if I’d repurchase it, I’m sorry!",0.0

"This sunscreen was oily on my face. Its consistency is thin, liquid-y and has a tint. It absorbs quickly but leaves a slight white cast at first when you apply but it goes away after few minutes. It does a slight Pledge-y lemony smell but it doesn’t linger around. It also has hyaluronic acid so it retains moisture throughout the day. I’ve combo skin and I didn’t like it even though it’s a oil free sunscreen. It definitely does not feel heavy on skin but light. I don’t mind this sunscreen if I’ve no other to wear but it’s not my 1st choice.",0.0
"This is my favorite moisturizer ever. This is a big statement for a skincare junkie. I LOVE this. I have combo type skin and thought the water cream would be more fitting for me, but I was underwhelmed by that. A friend of mine had the dewy cream and when we were on vacation together, I used hers everyday. I was obsessed. I bought it immediately and haven’t stopped since. This moisturizer feels like luxury on your skin. It is so rich but does not feel too heavy. Even with my oily t zone, I have no issues with this. I use it at night and days when I am home all day (ie not outside in the sun bc i have spf for that) During this quarentine season, I have been using this day and night, and its such a treat. I will cleanse, use my AHA toner, then a serum, then top off with my dewy skin. If I had to pick one moisturizer only for the rest of time, this would be it.",1.0
"I do not like this face wash at all. I purchased this because I read reviews and it has a high rating. These are the reasons why I do not care for this product. 1. I have combination skin that leans more dry and I felt like this completely stripped my face of any and all moisture. 2. It made my skin feel tight and not in a healthy youthful way. 3. I could actually see the dry in my face and I never, ever get dry patches. 4. I don’t feel like it cleaned my face very much at all. One star for scent and I like that it has essential oils. Price point isn’t bad either for how much you get. I typically enjoy Origins products - however if you have combination skin or dry skin I would steer clear of this product. Maybe this works for oily folks but I hate using this. I probably won’t even finish the wash and will give it away - it’s that bad. :(",0.0

"Personally I’m not a fan of this facial mask. Smells kind of weird. I must say it’s very interesting to see the clay turn from pink to white as you rub it in but I think my skin is just too sensitive for this product. Just a few mins after applying, my skin started tingling and burning. When I took it off, my face was so red and irritated where the mask was. U could literally see the lines from where the mask was applied. The redness lasted an hr or 2. On top of that I didn’t see any change in my skin. Would not recommend especially if you have sensitive skin. I received this complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.",0.0

Seriously, I got so excited when I bought it that the sales lady was looking at me strangely.",1.0
"Received a small sachet to sample for free from topbox. I liked the consistency - very thick. I’d definitely suggest it for night use, if your under eye area is very dry.

"I’d love to give this 5 stars- it goes on well and is not greasy. However it doesn’t provide protection! We got this for our trip to England.

I was really excited about this product but then I wanted to return it... I decided to stick with it and have seen some visible brightness in my skin after a week of use. Pros - Purchased for 50% off Not as irritating as other highly concentrated vitamin C products Doesn’t burnSaw a significant improvement to skin brightness after a few days.

I didn’t love this product. This is the third cleansing balm that I’ve used and about to be done with the entire thing and will not be purchasing again. I does noticeably seem to remove black/white heads once it lathers but not as well as the heimish all cleansing balm. It also leaves my face feeling slightly dry. Something that heimish does not do. I recommend heimish over this product!,0.0
I REALLY wanted to love this product since I’ve been wanting to try biossance for quite some time. I have oily skin and this was just too much for me. It caused breakouts the first time I used it. I stopped for about a week and retried it and broke out again. I wasn’t able to use my Night time moisturizer because the oil was a lot on my skin. I think this may be more for people with dry skin. I read to mix it with foundation but I’m too afraid to do that as I’m oily enough in the daytime.,0.0

"Liked it, not loved it. Decent.I won’t lie- my skin did feel nice and hydrated after use. But that’s really it. It didn’t give me any kind of “lit from within glow“, and I certainly didn’t feel any plumping like some reviews claim. Also, personally, I would never use this as a primer. Not only for the reason that I am oily and breakout prone and prefer matte primers, but also for the fact that I don’t see how makeup would have staying power with this as a primer. But that’s just me.Lastly, I am a stickler for packaging, and I actually bought this product because I thought the packaging was really gorgeous and would look nice on my little beauty counter. I actually loved the packaging so much that I decided I would put this product on the “first row“ of my beauty counter- which is saved for products with the prettiest packaging. When I received this product it was in tact, but as soon as I touched it, like literally just touched it- hadn’t even used it yet- it became “dented“ (if that makes sense) all over. Now it has a seat in the back row.Basically, in summation, okay mask. Nothing to write home about.",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product , the packaging is so beautiful and I have always loved Dior skincare . Right from the beginning the smell is a bit strong but it does go away. It has a strange liquid to powder like texture so I wasn’t sure how to incorporate it into the rest of my routine. I don’t dislike it the product but I can’t say I absolutely love it . I continue to use it just in case I’m missing something . So far I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and the only thing I can say is that it gives my skin a sort of soft diffused look kinda like a primer . Overall I don’t dislike it but I wouldn’t be able to justify paying so much without more benefit .",0.0

The primer was very hydrating and I really enjoyed applying it. The product was very silky and just melted beautifully into the under eye area.

"This lip balm is… fine, just not necessarily what I look for in one. The color is nice but I think not the most flattering for my neutral medium skin (I’m a somewhat tan Asian). It’s kind of a bright pink, which just isn’t a shade I usually go for. It’s also a bit waxy for my taste - I’ve come to prefer more oily/slippery formulas that your lips really absorb.

Not only do I require less per use than other creams I’ve tried, but I wake up with refreshed and soft skin.It’s completely cleared up my dry skin issues (which were noticeable even under makeup prior to this), reduced the redness in my cheeks, and also seems to help with outbreaks (which are not common for me, but I have noticed less of). It soaks in quickly, and does not feel sticky or leave greasy residue.As an added bonus, it works amazing as a tattoo cream and minimizes that itchy dryness without you feeling the need to constantly apply it. It is also incredibly useful for skin irritations/rashes and bug bites.It is practically a miracle cream. I highly recommend it.",1.0

I really wanted to love it and I kinda do. It feels great going on and it smells like creamy coconut.

I would maybe repurchase but I’d rather have the Kopari Lip love if you need more hydration.,0.0
This is what my lips were craving. In the colder months my lips get super super chapped so I was looking for a product to help with that and voila - I found this! I use it every night and pair it with the laneige lip glowy balm during the day,1.0

I wish I loved this since I love DE products and the TLC serum does wonders for my skin but unfortunately this product is not for me. It’s light and not oily but once I started using it I broke out like crazy. I thought maybe it was just hormonal acne? I stopped using it then gave it another try a few weeks later and my skin broke out again. Sad to give this a low review :(,0.0
"This thing is amazing!!! Smells light, feels light, amazing packaging! Cleans up all the make up, allow it! Not over drying for the skin and my skin is cleared up with a combo of this and a mask I used weekly from proactive. Not a fake review from marketing agencies.

"My skin is sooo sensitive to alcohol so the fact that this contain ZERO alcohol, i had to buy it. I had never used glycolic acid so i only bought just to give it a try. I always have hormonal acnes on my cheek and it gave me redness and little bumps, made it look so ugly. If you have the same issue as me, this toner is for you!!! It has been only a week now since I started using this toning solution, my skin feels&looks so different. The bumps are all gone, the redness faded, its amazing! When I first applied it to my skin I felt the subtle tingling feeling. So I thought it was not gonna be good for my skin but i was wrong. The next morning I saw a dramatic difference in my skin when I woke up. My skin looked so fresh, my bumps are all calmed down. I was soo amazed!(As instructed I only use this solution usually before I go to bed and only once a day. )If you have congested skin, nothing ever has worked for your bumps yet your skin is sensitive, but you are looking for something to change your skin condition,YOU GOTTA BUY THIS!!",1.0

I even tested it with a white flushable wipe and I was disheartened to see a significant amount of makeup come off. For this price, you can get the Clinique Take The Day Off balm (which is $1 more but you get an extra 25ml) which works wayyyyy better.Save your money, points, and nostrils. Don’t get this.",0.0

This is like a thick cream. While it was easy to apply there wasn’t much product to tissue off. I had to remove it with a damp cloth.

"I was pleasantly surprised at how well and how quickly this cleared up blemishes. Most of the time I put it on at night and the next day the pimple would be flat and less red, but sometimes I even put it on during the day under light makeup and it worked that way as well. The only cons are the smell is extremely strong and it’s hard to get the right amount out because of the way it dispenses. Neither of these will prevent me from buying it.",1.0

I also just started adding retinol to my skin care routine, so finding a good moisturizer is my main goal nowadays. After receiving the samples from Influenster and have used for couple of weeks, I would like to give my honest review about this cream. The cream is perfect for night since the the texture might be a little bit heavy for the morning. It goes really smooth onto my skin.

I can’t say how it’s in the long run, but i definitely want to continue to use it and recommend it for my friends.",1.0

"Farmacy Beauty gifted me their Honey Halo Ceramide Moisturizer. I really loved the packaging of this Honey Halo. It’s a nice glass container with a wood type lid that has a magnetic spatula that stays on the lid. Very useful so you do not lose your spatula. The opening of the container is a little so small so I hope when it starts to get low, I can still access the rest of the product easily with the spatula.  I really loved the texture. It was a nice cream texture and it absorbed into my skin really well. My skin soaked it all in and was very moisturized. It has helped with dry flakey patches I have had and will be a blessing come wintertime! It says its fragrance free but there is a hint of scent which I’m sure is natural. I can’t describe it, but it wasn’t bad and faded away quickly.",1.0

Natural, clean, silicone-free, perfect consistency, creamy & hydrating but not heavy, light pleasant natural scent (a little like tea <3), glass packaging, great ingredients & effective.

This stuff is incredible and I really wanted to hate it. I’ve never had an acne problem but I always have those stubborn ones on my forehead that always come back. Now my skin is very sensitive as well so I need to be careful. But this THIS is amazing I no longer get the acne on my forehead and I don’t really understand how that is possible.

"I’ve used this almost every day since the end of July, and I’ve got to say I’m disappointed. It hasn’t made my skin look any different at all. I have fairly normal skin but I’m concerned about early aging. I do have some noticeable lines and it’s something I’ve been battling with for a few years now. I was hoping this cream would help with the appearance of the lines on my forehead but they haven’t gotten any better at all. Literally made zero difference with them. It does feel nice going on, didn’t cause any breakouts, doesn’t have much of a scent which is nice, but for me, it doesn’t live up to it’s promises of replenishing my skin and immediately reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles, or even reducing their appearance over the course of two  months. Huge bummer, especially considering the price of it. Also, I wouldn’t say it makes my skin feel moisturized, like right now my face feels a little tight and dry, but to the physical touch it makes my skin feel soft. It’s not a terrible cream, it just didn’t improve the look of MY skin whatsoever. It’s probably good for someone with sensitive skin looking for a cream that won’t irritate their face. Two stars because it didn’t cause any damage to my skin, and I like what the company is about.",0.0

I wanted to love it I really did but I just couldn’t imagine spending so much on the full size after it did nothing for my skin.

If this product would come in lower dosages to then build up to the current percentage I think it would be better.

I definitely noticed a difference it made my skin baby soft!! I loved how soft it made my skin but it’s too expensive for the amount of time it lasted me! I would use it twice a day right after cleansing and before applying other skincare unfortunately it only lasted a little over 3 months! Once o realized it wasn’t going to last very long i tried to get creative with it and used less... i even tried putting it in a bottle and spraying it but i didn’t like how it went everywhere and it didn’t feel like it was equally distributed across my face. Most of my skincare is somewhat pricy but at least it last longer than 3 months so I’m going to stick to something more affordable.,1.0
This product is not hydrating enough for dry/combo skin. It soaks right in to your skin So you’d think it would be very hydrating but still leaves it flaky. I have combination skin so this just doesn’t work for me.,0.0
"Before talking of this product, we need to understand what collagen is, and what it does. Collagen is at the base of the dermis. Collagen, think of it as the springs that give the bounciness to the matress that is the dermis. A healthy yougn skin has a ton of collagen, and that results into even skin tone, bounciness, elasticity and firmness. Now collagen gets broken for many reasons, hormonal changes, pollution, UVA rays. A comprehensive system that protect that collagen and helps repair it is crucial to mainain a younger looking skin. SPF and Vitamin C here are crucial. Still, no matter how much you protect and address the isue exfoliating, protecting, using all the right anti oxidants, theres always going to be room for improvement. I received my first bottle of this as a gift, and used it as my essence. I already had a comprehensive skincare routine! Then, I got a second bottle...and so carried on using it.. And then one day I noticed the difference. As result of my age, my jaw has started to loose definition. Nothing terrible, but I can notice it! Also my skin , though healthy and beautiful had loss a tad of its usual glow. Now, the glow is back, and people are complimenting my skin much more tan usual, speciall when not wearing any make up. The only thin I have changed is this liquid collagen, so after pondering about, it makes sense that m skin appears firmer and brighter and just so gorgeous. This collagen, unforunately, works. It is expensive, Sure. Do you must? No, specially if you alreday have a good routine inplace. Would it improve your skin considerably? Yes it would, so if you have some extra cash to spend, go ahead!

I had really high hopes for this moisturizer but it unfortunately disappointed me. I have combination skin and with reading many reviews that seemed ok. But no. It sat on top of my skin for hourssss!

"I’ve just recently received this product and it has made such a difference with the eczema on my face. It’s been a struggle for years to find something to help and not irritate my eczema prone skin any further. I’ve bounced from dove beauty bar, as recommended by my dermatologist, and a few other cleaners and I think now I have found my holy grail. It cleans my skin without stripping and the oatmeal helps sooth my red scaly patches. It’s very much like rubbing vaseline on your face, but in the best way possible. And you can even use it as a 10 minute mask. I was so surprised on how much I received for the price, and a little goes a long way. So it’s very much a steal! I highly recommend picking this up, and if it doesn’t work as a cleanser for you, it has a chance of being a really nice calming mask.",1.0
"I’ve never really run into a product quite like this before. I live in a colder climate, so I haven’t experienced the separation other people do. I have the opposite issue where it’s so thick that it takes 2 hands to squeeze the product out. The texture is really weird. I definitely recommend emulsifying in your hands first. This product is great for my dry skin, but if you don’t like the feeling of residue on your face, I would definitely double cleanse. But it’s not super great at removing waterproof eye makeup, so if you’re a heavy makeup wearer, I also wouldn’t recommend this. So basically if you don’t mind a residue feeling/double cleansing and don’t wear makeup, you’ll love this. Otherwise it’s probably not going to be the best fit.",0.0
"Don’t get the hype. It smells nice, but it doesn’t make my make up wear better when used as primer & doesn’t make me glow when used as highlighter. I do have oily skin so maybe thus is better for dry skin?",0.0
This is my holy grail. I love how it makes my skin feel and the scent is subtle but amazing. It really does the trick by hydrating your skin through the driest of days. I also love the packaging because it is easy to take anywhere. You won’t regret this purchase.,1.0
"I don’t have some of the same complaints as most negative to mediocre reviews. It did not break me out. And it does absorb into my skin quite easily; I was able to apply makeup a few minutes after my morning application which was surprising. I found during the first week that my skin was looking dewy which was exciting. However, after the first week of use, I started waking up with tight, dry skin which wasn’t happening before switching to la Mer. I even had to start applying a facial oil before applying la Mer because the la Mer just wasn’t enough on its own... my skin was becoming drier and drier. This is absolutely not what I anticipated from such an iconic product. If I hadn’t been using my PTR C serum for the last 6 months, which has been a game changer for my skin, perhaps I would’ve seen more improvement in my skin tone. The reviewers that claim that la Mer dramatically calmed their skin down makes me think they were unknowingly using something previously that was inflammatory. For a product at this price point, I cannot justify having to also use an expensive vitamin c serum AND add in a facial oil to compensate for the drying effects of long term use of this product. La Mer also did absolutely nothing for the fine lines on my forehead. So what am I left with? Dewy skin in the first few hours after application, but overall drier skin than before starting this product and a need to find something for my fine lines. Overall, not worth it at all. Too bad.",0.0

"First off, it’s in a tube so major brownie points since I hit digging my fingers into tubs. Second, I have sensitive eye area (eczema prone) but no irritation.

"I have combination/oily skin and this dehydrated my skin so much that it felt really tight and dry after I washed it.

"I was not a fan of this product. It has an herbal smell to it, I guess that’s the best way to describe it. It actually liked the smell and that it did even out my skin tone, but that was it. The product is green right out of the container and is supposed to turn beige when you rub it into the skin. Even after rubbing, I still had a green hue to my skin. It also has a sandy texture, which inevitably got into my hair and brows. As it wore throughout the day, I developed white creases from the product.",0.0
I bought it because a lot of people raves about it but I just didn’t work for me. Doesn’t keep my skin moisturized and I need that especially for the cold seasons. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it.,0.0

I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I liked that the skin cream was lightweight and not oily. It provided me with a matte layer which helped with my greasy T-zome. I did not have pore issues to begin with so I am not able to review that part of it.,1.0
"Smells great, doesn’t feel too heavy going on, like the texture, but just doesn’t work for my combination skin. It made me extremely oily and made me break out especially on my forehead.

I have been using this product for many years until now. This company is owned by Loreal which I will not support anymore because of how they publicized their company. Amber Heard was a violent abuser to her husband Johnny Depp. Johnny lost is roles in pirates of carribbean while she gets to still be promoted by Loreal. It doesnt float with me. what a horrible company. They are a supporter of domestic violence.,0.0
"PROS:- Packing was different, and easy to use.- Get plenty of product for the price.CONS:- The smell. Period.- The texture was a little thin for my liking, but that’s still manageable.- Didn’t notice a difference in my skin after using it twice a day until product ran out.Overall, just didn’t work for me and my skin. And the smell; that needs to be worked on, big time. Wouldn’t repurchase again.",0.0

It actually stays put overnight and in the morning there’s still some left on your lips! OMG, this mask is incredible! So much better than the Bite Beauty Agave+ Overnight Lip Treatment, IMO! This container will LAST because a little goes a long way, and coming from a woman with very full lips AND they’re prone to dryness... That’s saying something! Lol! Definitely a must have!",1.0

I’m a huge TATCHA fan and have always loved the packaging, but the brand clearly didn’t think this one through.

As much as I enjoy the actual cleanser, I won’t be purchasing again due to the packaging.",0.0
"I’ve been using this product nightly for the past month and I haven’t really noticed a difference. It’s kept my eye area hydrated, but didn’t do much else.

It’s super annoying that you always need the scooper - if you lose that, good luck trying to get any product out for every use.",0.0

I really wish I could say I like this mask with all the great reviews and the price.. but It made me break out! I woke up with a very greasy face ( considering I have dry skin) and small breakouts. I do not have acne prone skin either. I think it is just too heavy of a mask to be used regularly,0.0

"First of all, these smell awful! The package says peach bellini and I definitely get a hint of that, but it’s mostly alcohol which is listed first in the ingredients list.

I will not repurchase!",0.0
"I’ve heard so much hype about this so I decided to try it out. To preface my review, I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily when I use a product that is not right for my face. i purchased the dr. dennis gross for sensitive skin and after the first day of using it, my skin glowed. I continued to use it (2 times a week as instructed by my sephora consultant) and i noticed with the second time i used it, my skin seemed a bit bumpy the next day. I decided to continue using it as it may need a trial period but after the 6th use, my skin broke out in acne so I immediately stopped using it and returned it.  However, the damage is done and it took 5-6 months for my face to completely heal. Although my acne went away, I still had scarring. I had such high hopes for this product but it fell below my expectations. For those with extremely sensitive skin like mine, I would think twice before purchasing it or perhaps use it at a less frequency per week.",0.0
"This product was very hydrating and left my skin very soft and glowy. I didn’t see and major differences in fine lines and wrinkles though. It didn’t have much of a scent, there was a slight floral scent. Kind of calming. I don’t think I would recommend this to anyone who is searching for a product to help with plumping.

"I wanted to love this but it’s just way too oily for my sensitive skin. For some reason I thought this would be more of a mist, but it comes out in globs. I applied it and waited about a half hour to see if it would dry down and be less sticky but that wasn’t the case, so I’ll have to find something lighter.",0.0
"I got this as a free sample and used it for about 2 weeks. It glides on smoothly and noticed it leaves somewhat of a sticky finish but smells really good. Into the 2nd week, however, I started breaking out. Not wanting to blame it right away as the reason for my breakout, I continued to use it but ultimately stopped after a few more days with no let up on the breakouts. I got tired of the sticky finish as well. I didn’t feel refreshed after my skin care routine like I usually do.",0.0

I absolutely love that it’s powder form it make storage much easier and cleaner and I don’t have to worry about spilling it. Now let’s talk about how well it works! It is good for sensitive skin and it’s non irritating but it also is very powerful and my smim feels very clean and refreshing without being dry and aggregated . It’s a must buy! Watching the powder turn into bubby liquid just adding water is kinda fun and unique. Great product,1.0
"They’re okay. I used them on a couple of different spots; while they did reduce the lump/swelling, they didn’t actually get rid of the acne. The bump would come back during the day, disappear at night under the patch, reappear during the day.....etc. Possibly these work on white heads, pimples about to pop, than actual acne under the skin still forming? (which is my issue) I gave them three stars since they do get rid of the bump each time you use them....but they definitely don’t get rid of the acne itself.",0.0

"Two stars for best moisturizer packaging, one star for effort. I don’t regret buying because I’ll reuse the jar. This cream glides and turns to water shortly after application. It’s a very odd consistency and almost ensures uneven application. On top of that, silicones can break out some people. Next time, I would go with a drugstore lotion like Neutrogena Hydroboost, save $60, and put it into this nice blue jar.",0.0
I love this serum! It makes my skin extremely beautiful even though I have sensitive and red skin sometimes. It calms it down especially when I break out. I would recommend this to everyone.,1.0
I’m so upset with this product and how it’s worked... please do not buy this unless you’re willing to take a 50/50 chance of worsening the wrinkles under your eyes. The crease right below my waterline has gotten longer and more prominent since using this product. It also did absolutely nothing to help decrease puffiness,0.0
"I first tried a travel size of this face mask, really liked it back then. It smells like heavy (rose smell) and the whole experience is great. Not sure if it does much to the skin, but you will enjoy using it. This second time I purchase this, my experience is only okay. The product didn’t change, it maybe I am just tired of it. No obvious result, I prefer using a hydrating sheet mask now.",0.0
"Ordered this and was hoping for a change to my skin (I have very acne prone skin and my forehead & jawline have dark acne scar spots). I had been using it for a couple months (usually 3 to 5 times a week; at night when skin is repairing itself and is more receptive to skin care products). I thought I was seeing results and maybe there has been a slight change, but my old scars are still dark and some new acne came along. I don’t know if it’s just not working on aggressive scars or if it’s because I used this with others products (like after a charcoal facial scrub or after PanOxyl cleanser on other days and if that was messing with how affective the lactic acid is) but in any case it’s not really working. It doesn’t seem to do well for me, but might work for others.  I’ve stopped using it for now to see how well the stronger AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution works. I just received that this week and will write a review later.",0.0

Based on the amazing reviews I decided to get a free sample of this product. I have dry/combo skin and it usually loves rich products. Not this. I started breaking out on my under eye skin within days of trying this sample. I stuck with it in hopes my skin was merely purging. NOPE. The breakouts only went away after I stopped using this and went back to my combo of Mario Badescu Hyaluronic Eye Cream in the day & Kiehl’s Midnight Eye. I loved the rich texture but my eyes didn’t.

Now I will never go back!!!",1.0
"Pretty annoyed. Bought this and saw some results, however after a few weeks, couldn’t get anything out of the bottle. Thought maybe the pump was clogged. No. The bottle is weighted and there is a very, very small bag inside the bottle. VERY little product for the money and pretty shady packaging.",0.0
I tried this at the store before I purchased it because it is a little pricy! I honestly really liked the way it made my skin looked but it had a very weird smell to it. The WORST part is that now I have broken out after this one time use and I have the worst cystic acne because of it. I read reviews saying the old one is much better & I wish I would have tried and bought it then because I have heard so many great things about this moisturizer. I would say I can’t give anything above a 1 star because my acne is terrible and i’ve never had it like this before.,0.0

"My person experience with these strips has been amazing! Even though I follow a normal skin care routine (much like a lot of others), I never figured out a way to get rid of small, pesky little pimples that would arise around my nose, chin and forehead area. However, with one use of these strips, most of them had been completely sucked up and disappeared like magic off of my face! It’s truly disgusting, but extremely satisfying to know that your skin has been rid of whatever comes off. These strips also suck out excess oil from out of your skin, which really helps with my acne prone skin! Overall, I would highly recommend giving these a try! It’s worth noting that, if you want to see very disgusting things on your strip, you should use these when your skin has really been acting up. When I use them normally, there aren’t many little white circles on the strip; however, when my skin has been really bad, that’s when there’s lots to see!",1.0

However, I won’t be purchasing the full size because all the lovely antioxidants will lose their potency in no time being exposed to air in a jar container. At this price, no thank you. I don’t understand why high end brands continue to package anti aging products in jars. And since only my positive reviews ever get published, I’d be surprise if this one shows up.",0.0
This sunscreen was just okay. It is a little more on the greasy side and would also peel and ball up off of the skin when rubbing it in. It didn’t leave much of a white cast on the skin which was nice. I wouldn’t buy it again.,0.0
Okay moisturizer. Didn’t really notice too much of a difference from my normal one.,0.0
"I would not call this a “rich cream” at all. My skin felt tight and dry after using it. As far as redness goes, this actually made my skin more red. I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry and I had high hopes for this cream. It might be better for someone with normal skin.",0.0

"I received this product as a free sample from Pinch Me and I was pleasantly surprised on how much I liked this product. I applied as directed and left on my face for 10 minutes. I have dry sensitive skin so I am always afraid to try new products because I can have reactions to some skincare brands. But I did not have a reaction to this product and it left my skin feeling smooth, refreshed and soft. The only negative is that I like my cleansers to get the job done quick, this takes 10 minutes.",1.0
I started using this mask exactly 1 Year and and haven’t looked back since! I’ve purchased 2 and a mini for myself  and give them to all my friends as gifts! It’s hydrating as an overnight mask or apply a light layer during the day for some extra dew or moisture. Perfect for under eye area if you’re tired or puffy. During flights it’s exactly what I need so my skin isn’t dry coming off the plane. You definitely need the jet lag mask for your self care needs!,1.0
"I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. The first thing I noticed, is that my makeup lasted longer, I didn’t need to retouch or re apply anything. It made my skin look smoother and it gave me a matte finish without making it feel dry.",1.0

"I have really dry, sensitive skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that will give me hydration, reduce redness and give me a glow. This moisturizer does all of the above. I got a sample in store and am purchasing now. The packaging is stunning and it smells really light, like a day at the spa. New favorite moisturizer!!!",1.0
"Honestly wanted to love it because it feels light but it left me really greasy and separated under my makeup. I wore this under the Estée Lauder foundation, after a few hours, everything separated and I looked sooo cakey. It may because of the formula differences of both but since that is my go to foundation, I don’t see the point of forcing it. I use this sunscreen for my arms now (LOL). If anyone is looking for other sunscreens, I recommend the Bondi Sands Face SPF 50 sunscreen and Bliss spf 30 sunscreen. They’re cheaper and dry down matte with no white cast.

"Korres Greek Yoghurt facial cleaner is so good! Not only did it foam up (which is something I love in a cleanser), it hydrated while it cleansed in some sort of weird wizardly combination!

"One of the best DE products.. also carries the DE pricing. This one is more reasonable though because the product has 25% AHA, just a few percent shy of being professional level but is a way cheaper experience. I’ve only used this a handful of times (when I remember) along with the accompanying oil, but my pores have gotten significantly smaller and my acne doesn’t flare up as much. For reference, I only usually get acne in my t-zone. Mostly from stress touching my forehead, but I used to get terrible zits on my cheeks that last foreverrrrrrr. The first couple of times I used it, upon initial application, my skin was tingly and subsided before the 5 min mark. After the third or fourth time, it only tingled on spots with opened pimples. (ew, bad habit, I know)Dries pretty fast, so one shouldn’t lag while applying, also this should only be on your face max 20 mins. There’s instant results after washing off, face feels tighter but smoother. applying the oil after soothes the skin and counters the immediate dryness. Works on a wide range of skin types, applied it on my aunts and cousins, they loved itif I used this every week, I’d know that my skin would be terrific. as of right now, I use it about once a month or even two months, and there’s a visible difference from before I bought the product.",1.0

"I have combination skin, and I found that this moisturizer affected the different parts of my face very differently - some parts felt more oily, while others felt more dry.

seemed to have left a film on my face. which im not really a fan of. feels soft putting it on but doesnt absorb as much as id like.,0.0
This is the most magical product ever. The tiniest bit on clean skin makes you look like you’re walking around with an Instagram filter on. I wear this with just a teeny bit of blush and eyebrow gel on top and I feel like I look better than when I wear a full face of makeup sometimes.,1.0
"I really wanted this product to be to my liking, but unfortunately it was not.This product has no smell, it is quite light, it seems that you are using simple water on the face; at first you do not need too much product, but I’ve noticed that around week 2 I start using more product. As for the results, it is already 4 weeks using this liquid and there is no change in my face, everything that was going on with it, is still the same, the same fine lines and the same dark spots, all the same.From my experience, I do not recommend this product.I got it for taste & review purposes thanx to Influenster.",0.0

My skin did not feel greasy after application.I did not see any immediate results from the use of this product.After several days of use, my skin feels soft and smooth, but did not show any major changes.After several weeks of use, it is my opinion that this cream doesn’t have any benefits that would cause me to recommend or purchase, myself.I find this product has far too many unnecessary ingedients for my taste.",0.0

Everything from Skinfix I’ve tried has been a huge hit but I think this is my favorite so far? This product is single handedly repairing my moisture barrier right now after I neglected to do some skincare routines this week.

"I’m surprised the high ratings on this moisturizer. I felt like it did nothing for my skin, and I mean nothing as in it literally felt like I had not moisturized at all. I have continued to use it since April since I always hear wonderful things about Drunk Elephant and was hoping maybe it just didn’t “feel” like I had moisturizer on but it was working it’s magic underneath. But after months and months of using this, my skin looks more wrinkled and dry than before I started using this cream. So I’m throwing the towel in and writing this review. I am giving it 2 stars because it did not break me out or give me a reaction but I would in no way recommend this product. I have combo skin and in my late 30s.",0.0

While it did what a good cleansing balm should and removed my makeup, I felt like I had to really scrub at my skin with my second cleanse to make sure I got all of the balm off. Also, the top corner popped open? So when I would squeeze some of the balm out the bottom, it would also come out the top which just wasted product. Wouldn’t repurchase.",0.0

"In my own opinion, this mask doesn’t do anything for for my skin/skin type (I have combination skin type with oily t-zone and dryness around my mouth). Initially when I put on the mask, I can feel a cooling and smoothing sensation that really calms my face down. Based on the ingredient list and the appearance of the mask, it is a very natural product that won’t do harm to the skin. However, after I washed it off, I felt no difference in my skin and it didn’t make my skin soft whatsoever. I tried this several times more, but everytime felt like I was putting a rosy scent water on my face, so I decided to stop using this. I’ve heard and read reviews of people loving this product and claimed that their skin got so much softer, pores so much small, and etc. This probably doesn’t work for everyone, but props to those people who made this work for them!",0.0

I loved and still love some of the LANEIGE prosecutes. Yet this one could be a miss if you are not really looking for anything that’s just good value for the money. It’s more like a toner compare to a moisturizer cuz you’ll still need to use a moisturizer afterwards but can’t be heavy anymore cuz this one contains a bit of the oil in it.,0.0

"I really liked this cream! First of all it smells amazing! It’s not a citrusy orange smell, but more like a creamsicle smell which I loved! The cream applys nicely, it’s not greasy or thick. Once it’s on it doesn’t feel like you have any moisturizer on, it’s that lightweight!! After a few uses I could see it giving some life to my dull, dry skin. It really does moisturize and brighten. I also tend to be sensitive to face creams, especially ones that are scented, but this one didn’t irritate me at all. Other brands of face creams that I typically use are just as great when it comes to moisturizing, but what makes this cream the best is that it’s light weight and smells wonderful!! I like to use it at night before I go to bed so that my face can take in all it’s moisturizing powers without caking makeup on top of it. I highly recommend this product.

"My experience with this product is very limited, but I wanted to add my first impression as a word of caution for people with more sensitive skin.I couldn’t wear this sunscreen even for 10 minutes.At first it was the strong scent; I expected Shiseido to use fragrance in their skincare, but the scent is just too much. After that it was the pasty thick consistency that makes it hard to apply; it also has a pearly sheen which can look perfecting under makeup for some and tin-man shiny for others; I applied the same amount I usually use for sunscreen, it was too much to look well so I had to wash and reapply a tiny amount (most likely not enough for actual sun protection). Third, 10 minutes after applying the thin layer I had to wash my face again because my eyes were watery and my skin was itching. It wasn’t that bad, but sincerely at that point I couldn’t stand the scent anymore. I do acknowledge I’m more sensitive than most people, so my bad experience might not be yours.",0.0
After years of searching for the perfect moisturizer I have finally found it. This product is so worth the hype it has transformed my face after 2 months of consistent use.

"I have somewhat sensitive skin but was looking to boost my skincare regimen with a new product. I got the Beste/Protini deluxe sample for my birthday gift from Sephora and decided it was a good time to try something new. I heard great things about DE (and that it was clean/good for sensitive skin). I eased into it and used DE alone to avoid mixing brands/ingredients. This stuff made my skin AMAZING for almost a week. I was on cloud nine and thought I found the holy grail of skincare. However, about 6 days in, I started to break out in a rash all over my face (redness, pimples, blotchiness, bumps, etc.), including in places where I never had pimples before. When the pimples started, I first thought it was a “purge“ and tried to power through it for one more day. But there’s no way this was a purge because it was more like a rash than acne. It got much worse the next day, and I ended up taking antihistamines to calm it down. I stopped using the cleanser and moisturizer and went back to my usual skincare routine, and my skin went back to normal in 3-4 days. Way too scared to try it again, as it’s just not worth it. Super disappointing, especially when the brand/product boasts being good for sensitive skin. Definitely be careful and patch test this for *several days* before going all in on it. I thought I was okay to use it, but I had a delayed reaction. I’ve read lots of similar reviews and posts on Sephora and other forums where people had the same experience.",0.0
"I’m 55 and have noticed puffiness under my eyes upon waking for the last couple years. I’m convinced it “hormonal” due the added changes in our thyroid levels as we go thru “that time of life”.

I see absolutely ZERO change after using this either in the morning or also adding it at night before bedtime. Tbh, a cold spoon or any of the gel eye patches does better than this. Glad it wasn’t expensive so it’s no big loss. I gave it one star because at least it didn’t make the situation worse or dry out my under eyes.",0.0
"I was having a hard time finding something that would remove ALL my makeup without leaving residue after washing my face.

You apply it to a dry face, texture is a a little solid but once it comes in contact to your skin it starts to melt .... reminds me of butter. It also immediately makes it easy to rub off the makeup. My skin felt clean and it removed all my makeup.

"This is is VERY oily aka dewy. It was great-ish for me during the winter months, but now that it’s spring I had to switch to a lighter facial moisturizer... and I’m glad I did. Here’s why...Even during the winter months, when I’d get SUPER DRY skin without using this moisturizer, this was still too heavy of a moisturizer. So much that I had to alternate every other day to a lighter one. For me, regardless of how I’d incorporate this moisturizer into my previous beauty routine, it really didn’t agree with my combination, hormonal cystic acne prone skin. I trialed an entire 1.7 oz and had daily cystic breakouts throughout the entire time I was trialing this.Now, I’m using CeraVe PM Moisturizer with Niacinamide to fade all my previously earned acne scars and control oil. For me, the CereVe PM works like a dream and I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now with no breakouts!Bottomline, everyone has their own unique skincare needs. This is a very high priced moisturizer.

I did not notice a huge difference in my skin aside for increased oiliness by the end of the day, to be fair it has been quite humid where I live recently. The product has a wonderful fragrance that could be off-putting for some, but I loved it! I will continue to try and love this because it smells wonderful and the packaging is luxurious! Overall, this product smells and looks wonderful, but did not do what I was expecting and left my skin feeling sticky and oily. I will not be purchasing this again once I get through the bottle I have.",0.0

"This item has great reviews but it’s never worked for me and I tried it many times hoping that it’d work. It leaves my dry spots dry as if it was never moisturized.

The most amazing thing is that it leaves the skin soft, young, and glowin’ without irritation (which I would have expected with the amount of exfoliation that it provided. I don’t think that you need to use it daily, maybe once a week at most though because it does such a good job exfoliating.tip: hydrate your skin after so that your new skin gets the most moisture!",1.0

"I love a good face lotion, however, this “hydrator“ was not for me. It has a gel-like consistency, so it left my skin feeling a bit tacky after rubbing it in.

I am giving this product 3 stars because I have sensitive skin and think this may work for someone else!",0.0
"I don’t like this product! It makes my eyes sting, wears horribly underneath my eye concealer, and my eyes are crusty in a way when I wake up.

I have to be very careful because sometimes when I squeeze it a blob of cleanser comes out. Such a waste of product.",1.0
"I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few months now. At first I really liked it. It feels nice on the face and the honey smell is to die for. However, I have dry skin and over time this product has seemed to just dry it more. This may be good for someone with oily skin to begin with but for me- the skin on the side borders of my nose are red, cracked and so dry it’s raw. Skip the hype and the product. Actually, don’t even bother getting moisturizer from sephora. There are too many chemicals in a majority of these moisturizers and baseless claims not backed by any science.",0.0

I feel that this cream would be great for colder weather to keep my skin nourish, hydrate and plump. The texture of the cream appears thick but glides on like a gel cream. The product have no scent.",1.0
I thought it was BS at first but wow this oil is incredible. Perfect for oily acne prone skin it calms and clears breakouts without drying your skin to bits. Not too oily it dries don’t fast as said. This oil calms down and/or  clears up my acne by 30% in one night. 3 days later I only have a few active breakouts from aunt flow. I personally love the smell but I can understand it’s not for everyone. Wish I had a before photo,1.0

I do this for 30-45 secs and then I leave it on for a few more seconds (it contains salicylic acid which is good for acne-prone skin!) and rinse.",1.0

"This toner serves its purpose but after using nearly the whole bottle, it hasn’t proven to show any results as the only new step in my skincare routine. I also don’t like the way my skin feels after using it and sometimes it has a slight sting to it, more so if I exfoliate beforehand. I wouldn’t repurchase this product.",0.0
I LOVE this stuff. I use it over night in addition to daily. The peachy color is a great sheer gloss that works well for me everyday. It’s moisturizing and actually sticks. I’m not constantly reapplying it. It’s also not like Vaseline where it can be overly sticky. I still get chapped lips but not nearly to the extent I normally do.,1.0
"Earlier this year, I tired it for several weeks.  It seemed to just sit in my face without absorbing.  It actually seemed a little worse than a typical facial cream.  Prior to throwing it away, I thought…well, the weather has changed, maybe I’ll like it more.  Nope.  I like it less than I did.  Very limited absorption.  It sits on my face (which is unusual).  After buying this, I bought some La Mer products.  Love!  I use the soft lotion, matte lotion (for under foundation), the concentrate and serums.  This CT brand makes some decent makeup, but the skin care is awful.  I have several of the CT products, including the serum (also awful).

"I was excited to try this but it really didn’t work for me. I don’t know how other ladies are loving this but I will never use it again. I normally use sunscreens with moisturizers because I have dry skin. I found that wearing this under makeup and alone will cause issues. When I wore it under makeup, it made my skin dry and caked up throughout the day. Not only that but if you sweat and the weather is hot out, it will look horrible! It basically built up my sweat and makeup and did not make me look cute at all. When I touched my forehead where I sweated, there were small clumps of sweat and makeup rolled up. Even alone it has this issue. There will be this weird texture. If you sweat or the weather is hot, it’ll look gross if you happen to touch your face. I do not recommend. Worst sunscreen I’ve used yet.",0.0

I enjoyed using it, it goes on smoothly and you don’t need a large amount, but once I actually looked up the ingredients I realized I can’t continue to use this product. It is not reef-safe, as it contains Octocrylene (can cause brain deformities in fish larva and reproductive toxicity - imagine what it could do to humans applying it regularly on their skin - and there is evidence that it can bleach coral). It also contains Homosalate, which doesn’t break down easily and has been found on sea life and corals. Bummer.",0.0

I love the product but this review is for the bottle itself. It sucks!! It leaks all the time and there’s no way I can find to stop it so the glass bottle is always sticky with the cleanser.

I am so impressed with this product!! I’ve only had it for a short while and I definitely tell a difference in my skin tone and texture. A little goes a long way. I only need about half a pump to do my entire face. It removes my make up without stripping my skin and leaves it feeling softer. It gently helps with my dry winter patches as well. I highly recommend this product. It is my new holy grail.,1.0
This cream is amazing! I first thought it might be to heavy for my combination skin in the middle of summer but the texture is so lovely. Instantly absorbs and keeps my skin hydrated all day.

"I currently use this product. It was suggested by a sephora employee when I was looking for a new face cleanser, this being recommended due to my sensitive skin.

This cream is exactly what it says in the name Magic. I applied the Cream to my face in the morning and was able to notice the difference in my skin immediately. This cream lasted the entire day and my face look great with just the cream after my morning face wash. I was able to use a small amount and still cover my entire face and neck.,1.0

Why I use it: I am a fan of waterproof mascara and brow pens & gels that are really hard to get out of my face, so it does wonders here.

"I have combo skin and have tried both the classic and the gentle polish powders. This is a nice, gentle way to exfoliate daily if you want (I only use this 2-3 times a week). I don’t notice too much difference between the classic and gentle powders, but they both leave my skin smoother and brighter albeit a little on the dry side (but its supposed to do that as it is removing dead skin cells). I took off a star because of the price (you can find similar products online that might not be as ’clean’ or SLS free) and because as pretty as the packaging looks, it’s very bulky. Would recommend if you want a gentle exfoliator and can handle the cost.",1.0
"I LOVE this moisturizer. I have been struggling for a skincare routine for a long time. I have suffered with acne and really oily skin for a long time as well. I purchased a travel size of this after a friend recommended it to me. At first, it made me really oily. I am pretty sure I was using too much as the website reccomends a pearl sized amount. Still, It made my face feel so good that I decided to keep using it to see if my skin would adjust to having added moisture.I never really did moisturizers because I would break out and be oilier than before. After about a week and a half, I use this twice a day after each wash and my skin absolutely craves it. It has helped my skin so much. I can’t remember a time when my face was so soft. For me, it does not cause any breakouts or irritation, which is another plus. I was reading some reviews and to be fair, the Tatcha website does recommend this for normal to oily skin. A lot of the bad reviews on here are people who have combination to dry skin, where the Tatcha website recommends a different moisturizer. It is expensive, but a little goes a long way .I received my travel size on October 8th and I probably still have a good week or two left and I use twice daily. I have already purchased the full size, as I will always keep this as a part of my routine.",1.0
"I love The Ordinary but, this product is a no for me. It dried out the skin around my eyes and made my lines more pronounced",0.0
So let me start by saying nothing will totally get rid of your puffy eyes.  It’s a genetic predisposition you are born with aka fat pad that ultimately you would have to get surgery to remove.  With that being said after waking up I can honestly see a 20% reduction in puffiness & the dark circles under my eyes.  I will not go to work without it.  I‘m 40 & some of my 30-year old coworkers say how come you never have tired eyes.  It’s a nice compliment.  In my opinion it’s way better than the ordinary caffeine eye dropper one.  That one did absolutely nothing.  Get it.  Inkey line is cheap why not?,1.0
"Very disappointed. I have dry, and sensitive skin. So I can’t just lather on a think layer. I really wanted to like this, but I break out every time I use it and it never seems to fully absorb. WAY WAY to rich for a day cream-- I would be so gross by the end of the day, that I couldn’t wait to get home and wash my face. I tried this for two weeks-- a little goes a long way-- and I’m ready to return it.",0.0
"it give you the good result for the skin, I love how the skin feel after use it. but I don’t think it’s good for everyday use. I’m combination skin, my skin kind feel dry after use for couple weeks",0.0
So I use this product a little differently and I’m gonna explain how I use it. I wasn’t a fan of it on my face I only like to use it when my skin got dry. I use it on my boobs and chest. I know that might sound weird but when I work out sometimes I can break out on top of my chest and I think it has to do with my sports bra and sweating so I use the oil all over my chest and one time I put too much in my hands so I used it on my boobs shockingly after working out I did not smell sweaty and if you know you know when you work out and have a sports bra the girls can smell a little sweaty well I didn’t smell sweaty at all. I’m a fan and will be rebuying!,1.0
The packaging is beautiful as always. I loved the texture of this cream. It applies really smooth on the skin. But it’s not super hydrating unlike some of my moisturizers in my current routine.It need layering for a good moisturizing and hydrating feel. Definitely not the best for dry skin during cold weather.,1.0
"I wish I could say something positive. But this is just an overpriced lip balm, at best. It’s not a treatment mask. You put it on your lips and it feels nice for the first 10 minutes and then it’s drying out. It definitely made my lips worse than better. I bought the sugar balm which is similar price and it actually works much better that the kissu. Very disappointed, I feel like I wasted my money on this product.",0.0
"I was gifted by dermalogica  a complementary sample from of their micro exfoliant and these are my thoughts: I’m not a huge fan of physical exfoliants but this one is nice, not harsh at all.

"It’s okay. It’s pretty, smells great, and feels soft on my lips for a little while, but it does not last and I can tell it’s not actually getting through to hydrate my lips. Just kind of sits on top. I like it enough to use throughout the day and finish the tube, but I won’t be purchasing again. If you’re looking for an actual hydrating lip balm, this is not it.",0.0
"Based on some other reviews, I got the original color/scent. I do like it - there are no downsides to the product itself, but I just don’t think it’s worth the money. I also looked through reviews of many lip masks before getting this, and it seemed to be the most promising.The first few times I used it, I felt like maybe my lips had a bit more plump and a bit more color to them. After using it a bit more, I think I was just seeing what I wanted to see. Like I said, it’s not a bad product, but it really doesn’t do anything differently than putting chapstick on your lips before going to bed, which I would always do anyway. It comes with a tiny applicator to put it on your lips (I don’t say this as a negative thing - it’s tiny because of what it’s used for - it’s not actually an issue and is the size you would expect), but in order to keep it, and the little pouch you store it in,  from getting all gunky, you have to wipe it off after every time you use it. It’s understandable, but also just makes it more work than simply using chapstick. If you want to splurge on something other than $1 chapstick for your lips, this is definitely the product, but if you’re looking for results beyond what you would get with that, this isn’t too much different.",0.0
"It’s a literally a water cream! After I use this cream, there’s water on my skin instead of the usual oil or heavy cream! The best part is that it’s so moisturizing, at the same time it’s so light (probably because there’s not much oily feeling to the skin). I loooove it so much!",1.0

It is probably meant for those who have oily faces, not so much for people who have dry faces like me.

"I wanted to love it, but it was just okay. I replaced my drug store moisturizer (about $10-$15 less expensive than this) based on a recommendation, and after using it for a month I do not see or feel a difference. I am almost out and am debating whether to purchase again. I am fairly new to layering, so it possible I didn’t layer correctly. I’m trying to keep my routine simple for now, so I used it in between my water based serum and sunscreen during the day, face oil during the night. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations - I have combination skin and my cheeks get really dry, and this moisturizer didn’t seem to make much of a difference. Overall, it felt nice, no harsh smell, sometimes a little bit of a tingling sensation but not too bad, so I am leaning towards buying it again. My friend raves about it, and we have similar skin, so I want to make sure I give it enough time to see real results.",1.0

I bought this because of all the positive reviews and people raving about it being the most luxurious product on the market. I’ve been using it daily at night after showering and removing my makeup for more than a month now. Nothing about my skin has changed! This may be great for people who have bad skin to begin with but for someone like me who has a pretty even skin tone, with very few breakouts, it did nothing. I did not notice any diminishing of pores like other reviewers -perhaps it is because I already have small pores to begin with? I’m not sure but I’m definitely going to finish the bottle for the hefty price I paid for it!",0.0
"This is my first time trying out a moisturizer from Glow Recipe. I tried this moisturizer a few times, and while I do like the texture of the cream, it’s not great for the colder weather. It felt too lightweight on my normal to dry skin. If anything, I would save it for the hotter weather. Overall, it’s ok.",1.0
"As much as I wanted to absolutely love the product, it wasn’t for me. It felt very heavy on my face regardless how much or little I used. I gave this a try for a week after resting a week from my normal routine. My face broke out quite a bit. It has no smell which is nice . It may be good for someone with out sensitive skin. But it just wasnt for me. (My skin type is combination)",0.0
"Very refreshing & feels very nice when cold, gives a very nice youthful glow helps moisturize and feel clean as well and close pores",1.0
"I wanted to try a new eye cream and gave this one a shot. within a few days my wrinkles were so bad, I didn’t know they were that bad. I should have kept to my regular eye cream",0.0
I received a sample size from Influenster in exchange for a review. I enjoyed using this moisturizer! It’s lightweight and silky. Didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy but also didn’t leave it feeling dry. I normally use a thicker moisturizer but this moisturized just as well. It soaks right in. It has a nice light scent. Left my face feeling fresh and gave me a nice youthful glow. I recommend it!,1.0
This did make my skin feel soft and refreshed.  Kind of stung a little but that may have been from the face washed used prior.  It does also have a wierd smell.  I would still recommend this product.,1.0
Love this Hyaluronic Acid! It’s soothing and hydrating without leaving a sticky residue,1.0
"What can I say this product is great all around and lasts forever. It will take off EVERYTHING in a breeze including matte lipsticks, waterproof makeup, etc. Having a double cleanse routine is crucial to keeping my pores in check and this does the job!",1.0
"I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. It’s very aesthetically pleasing (love the glass bottle, the fresh smell, the color and the healthy sounding name) When it comes to the actual product I was underwhelmed. I think it’s mostly because I prefer more of a foaming aspect in a cleanser, and this one hardly foams at all. My face just doesn’t have that clean feeling after which is important to me. Luckily I only purchased a travel size",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product because I saw so many reviews that looked and sounded like everything I needed since I have skin that easily gets red and sometimes blotchy red, and it definitely helped with that factor but I noticed after just the first use my skin started getting dry and flakey, and I moisturize morning and night my skin isn’t normally like this. I tend to have skin on the oily side, but this after just one use made my face feel really dry, tight and almost burned a little from how dry it made my face. I don’t think this is a good product for the winter time because of the air being so dry and it seeming to suck any moisture I have in my skin right out. I will try it again once it’s summer because it’s very humid where I live, maybe that factor will help balance out that drying affect.",0.0
LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser. It smells amazing and my skin feels so clean afterwards. It doesn’t not strip my skin of its natural oils like some other cleansers I have tried. Leaving my skin flakey and tight. This one cleanses but still keeps it hydrated.,1.0
"Don’t like it, made me breakout.",0.0
This product is amazing! I have hereditary dark circles and have been using this product twice a day for about a week now and my dark circles have visibly lightened and my puffiness is basically gone. Instead of a deep dark color I have a lighter reddish shade under my eyes which looks wayyyyyy better with no makeup on! Hereditary circles won’t ever complete lighten without dermal fillers but this definitely lightened my under eyes up significantly.,1.0
Love this stuff. When my skin is good I use this product to maintain my combination skin. I love how frothy it gets.,1.0
"Perfect solution for dry, cracked lips, I put this one every night and my lips stayed moisturized all night. It has a nice mild berry scent too!",1.0
I should have seen the 1 star review as well. Because my skin was Amazing only. I just wanted to get rid of open pores. So I saw the reviews that this was working for a lot of people. So I went for it. And I used it all 5 days as directed and I was getting 1 or 2 breakout. I thought it might be normal. But after that it started getting worseeeee now I am having a very very bad breakout. I don’t know what to do now. I regret using this product.,0.0
"I had been battling dry, flaky skin for months. I had tried every remedy possible, but my skin was still just flaking off which was gross and annoying. Finally, I went into Sephora and was purchasing another product, and this was left by someone at the checkout. I asked the cashier about it (I really just loved the elephant logo), and she said, ’It’s magical.’ Well, it really is. After just a few days, my skin completely improved. It effectively moisturized and the dry skin completely went away. I will purchase again.",1.0
"So almost all age groups in my family have tried this and this is everyone’s favorite. Too expensive to use it daily. However, we can see the glowy fresh effects even with one use. I usually wear it as a night cream or when I want the fresh natural makeup look. It just moisturizes in a nourishing way.",1.0
"I absolutely love this product. The picture with my hair up is the first day I used it and the second picture is today 2 weeks later. Granted I went to the beach so I’m a little tanner, but my skin is so much healthier and brighter. There is no filters used in these photos. I deal with dull uneven skin tone and this did wonders for me. Shortly after applying it absorbs and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy. I have stayed on top of using this daily and am so happy with the results. I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy it.",1.0
I really wanted to like this but didn’t. I found the smell rather overwhelming. The consistency was not the best for my skin. Felt a little too greasy for me and I found myself wiping it off pretty soon after putting it on. Did not live up to the hype.,0.0
"I am in love!! I got a 2mL sample of this and the results for me have been so instantaneous that I will be buying a full size. I have forehead lines that are not extremely deep, but very evident, and after a few minutes of having this on, the lines plump up and are extremely less visible. My skin is very combination oily/dry. Your skin will feel a little oily until you give it time to soak in the product. Once I let it sit for a bit, I follow up with my eye cream and face firming lotion.",1.0
"This Dermatologica Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator has been gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. It is made to help others achieve bright and smooth skin. This is also vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free, no parabens, no silicons, and no artificial fragrances or dyes.",1.0
"Just like the face wash, I’m genuinely impressed with how much I love this moisturizer! In fact, I’m almost done using the mini and already have the full size in my cart to repurchase after I’m done with my current jar. For reference, I have crazy dry skin in the winter time and now that I’m doing monthly chemical peels, my skin is a lot drier than normal. But this product has made a HUGE difference on my skin in regards to hydration and reducing redness from my face. I’m also noticing this product helping clear my skin as well! I love adding this moisturizer to my night routine after applying a light moisturizer for extra added hydration, but this can be used on its own as well. It’s a creamy texture for sure, so a little does go a long way. However, it does not grease up my face and I can wear this underneath my makeup with no issues with oily skin!Only reason why I’m giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is the packaging. Jars are not the most hygienic way to store skincare products, but I guess it’s normal packaging for creamier moisturizers. Otherwise, I’m excited to see what Milk Makeup comes up with next",1.0
"Oh. My. Gosh! You guys. It’s 10:54 PM on a SATURDAY night and I am taking the time to write this review. I feel like this is one of my first major contributions to society in my life on earth thus far. I just got a sample from Sephora of this today. I tried it just now. Backing up to my skin-I used to have perfect Korean skin, that baby bottom skin. I have always dealt with eczema because of my allergies.I have:-t-zone combination skin-yet kinda dry cheekies?-acne sometimes around my chin -blackhead City-some deep acne scars on my cheeks-uneven skin texture -redish slightly blotchy skin toneI tried this one time right now and I wish I would have taken before and after pics guys. The product was so crazy. I applied a layer on my skin and waited a few minutes. I started to use circular motions and literally my dead skin started coming out in chunks! At first I thought it was just the product clumping up, but then as I kept using the circular motions, the product was scrubbed off and I realized more and more dead skin was coming off! I’m not gonna lie, just be careful because I was feeling like I was gonna get mad wrinkles if I keep pulling on my skin to get the dead skin off so be delicate on your face. Lol I found it’s hard to get alllll the dead skin off without being a little rough on your skin. Whatevs, I did it anyways. I think I scrubbed at my skin for a good 5 minutes.. I used the circular motion until I felt no more dead skin. It was almost a strangely satisfying experience, like when you are squeezing a zit or blackhead, ya know?After I did my thang, I looked at my face. Oh my gosh I was amazed!!!!!!! I looked at my cheeks where my acne pits are prominent and I swear, my face in 3 years has never looked so smooth. It took layers of dead life off my face and some of my acne pits (the lighter ones) truly went away. I stood in the mirror in disbelief for a while lol. You guys MUST try this, absolutely amazing!",1.0
"Pros: I like that this has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent and that it absorbs into the skin very quickly.Cons: Leaves a sticky feel on the skin, haven’t seen any noticeable difference with puffiness or dark circles.I’m not sure how I feel about this product. I have only used it for about a week so far and haven’t seen any noticeable results.",0.0
"Definitely , super hydrating ! A little goes a long way. If you use too much it will for sure be too heavy on your face. I over did it a first because I’m used to having to glob moisturizer on to get my dry skin to feel hydrated. You will not have that problem with this. It isn’t a light formula either so I don’t feel like this is warm weather friendly or for people with oily skin It is something I use on a daily basis. How much of it depends on what my skin needs and the conditions I’m going to be in.",1.0
No more white cast sunscreen! Super lightweight and gentle for sensitive skin so you don’t get breakouts or overly dry or oily skin. Goes on super smooth and helps with getting a bit more hydrated skin.,1.0
"I wanted to like this so much, but it irritates my skin. It oxidizes my foundation too, so I always look redder than I am - and if I use a generous portion of product, then I turn extremely red. It also just doesn’t work that well. I have super oily skin and I read this works well. But I accidentally went a day without primer and realized my make up stayed better without it.  And it pills pretty badly. Overall, disappointing.",0.0
"This stuff is so amazing and luxurious. It is super moisturizing, but can be a bit thick for my skin sometimes. I’ll mix with regular moisturizer to thin it and it’s perfect",1.0
Love mixing this into my foundation when I’m in need of a darker shade. Gives me a glow while darkening the shade!,1.0

"I received a sample & tried it for 7 days. I now have 7 large cystic acne bumps on my neck, cheeks, chin & forehead. Prior to using this sample, I was using Clarins products & had the best skin of my life. My skin is a mess & sore now.",0.0
"i am writing this simply based on the birthday sample. i had recently used a lot of products with actives in them and then got sick, so i needed something gentle and decided to whip this out. this cleanser is nice, but the SOLE REASON i’m even writing a review is to say that when i’m sick my nose gets SO DRY and irritated that ALL cleansers make it burn when i wash my face. i even bought the cerave cream cleanser for dry skin that has no scent and even it burned!  beste doesn’t sting, burn, or ANYTHING and my nose feels exactly the way i left it (that is to say, this cleanser does not dry it out further even if it doesn’t add moisture). my skin has been pretty balanced lately aside from my cold, so i think that makes it hard to speak on this product for someone who has consistently problematic skin. but i just had to share that i expected this to be irritating, and i didn’t feel a thing! i want to keep a mini on hand just for when i’m sick! i’m only docking a star because it’s expensive for a “plain“ cleanser (as opposed to ones with actives/additives) and isn’t sold in a mini so i don’t know if i’ll ever repurchase it.",1.0
"Overrated product. Too rich for acne-prone skin, not a truly ’clean’ & natural product- you can tell when using it.",0.0
"Perfect barely there pink shade. Gives you a perfectly hydrated, glowy lip. I’ll literally never buy another lip balm.",1.0

"Love the Sunday Riley brand. They make products with ingredients I like. This eye cream definitely brightened my under eyes with a glowy, pearly finish.

So good for all skin types (including sensitive). This takes all the make up off and is so gentle & smooth. I also had my sister try it who has a sentive acne prone skin and she loved it so much that she bought one for herself immediately. There’s also no fragrance.,1.0
"I know people love this, but it didn’t take off my mascara and left a lot of make up on my face. I always double cleanse but with this I was left with way more make-up than usual (I usually use an oil cleanser first.) and had to triple clean my face to get off all my foundation and mascara.  I do not wear heavy foundation FYI.  Perhaps I needed to really goop up with more balm, but that makes this more expensive as I would go through this jar super fast compared to oil removers.  I wanted to like this but it didn’t work well for me.",0.0

"Considering the amount of money I spent on this product, I am extremely disappointed. I’ve been using it for a month now and I don’t see any difference in my skin.

"My skin feels so incredibly soft and supple, without feeling heavy. You definitely want to go easy on areas that could become oily throughout the day, but you’d have that with any oil. My skin doesn’t feel greasy at all, just deeply moisturized which is difficult for my dry skin to achieve in the desert heat. The scent is very light, like a warm herbal rose tea. I’m so pleased that this is a cruelty-free and vegan product as well. I will be using up every last drop! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0
Packaging is horrible. It is hard to control the amount of product that is squeezed out. Resulting in wasted product. The paint also chips off leaving paint chips all over the bathroom. As for the product it’s self.. meh!  I have  acne and have struggled to find a product that will help clear it up.  This product did not clear up and I also found it did not leave my pores clean. I would  not recommend this product to someone who truly needs a fantastic face  cleanser to clear up any concerns.,0.0
I have dry skin and was hoping this product would hydrate my skin. It unfortunately made my skin worse to the point where my cheek areas felt rough and applying makeup on top look horrendous. This product just wasn’t made for my skin and didn’t help my dry skin at all.,0.0
I do not recommend this for sensitive skin I’ve used it for a week and started breaking out unfortunately I will have to return this :(,0.0
I love the powder form of this cleanser. It’s a brand I trust and already love. It’s a great gentle exfoliant for my rosacea prone skin. I use it as part of my nighttime routine and since I’ve started I can see a difference in my overall texture. *gifted by dermalogica,1.0
"I used this for years, and unfortunately the most recent reformulation caused me to break out really badly in places I don’t normally. Also, this price is absolutely ridiculous; so many other companies have since come out with serums that are just as good, potent, and as ’clean’ as DE. I’m really happy that this product worked for me so long, but it’s time to move on. #dramatic",0.0
"I tried this based on a friend’s recommendation and am so happy I did. This serum goes on as a gel and takes about 15 minutes to fully absorb into the skin. It can be a little tacky as it dries, but the stickiness goes away once it is fully absorbed. It is super effective thanks to a highly concentrated blend of AHAs, with some salicylic acid in there for good measure. It literally tackles every skincare issue you can think of – aging, hyperpigmentation, dullness, pore size, acne, etc. I love that it is available in travel size too. This serum has given me brighter, smoother and more even skin. In fact, it has reduced redness and blotchiness faster and more effectively than any other AHA serum I have tried. What more can I say? This product is freaking phenomenal.",1.0
I love it it makes my skin feel so youthful and beautiful.like I was young again.i can’t wait to try more of this product,1.0
"This avocado recovery serum has a liquid feel and glides on smoothly. There isn’t a strong smell. The packaging is nice. I didn’t have any issues using it and it felt good on my skin. I use it during my “recovery” part of my skin routine to help restore my skin from stronger treatments. I would rate it a 6/10. It isn’t a must have for me, but it isn’t a bad product either.",1.0
"I tried this product out upon recommendation from staff, I have been a huge fan of the ordinary but figured they where hyping this up to be better so gave it a chance. I have been super disappointed by this and can’t wait to grab my regular stuff again.

"Just ok. I’ve been using it for over 4 months and don’t see any difference. It is moisturizing, but that’s about it. It more just sits on my skin and doesn’t soak in well. I also find it kind of sticky since it doesn’t soak in. Way too expensive for the size. After seeing all the good reviews, I had high hopes, but unfortunately I would not repurchase.",0.0
This product is amazing for anyone with dry and sensitive skin.  Wow.  When you first apply it seems a tad heavy however it melts on to your skin as an oil while lifting the make up off your skin.  Also amazing with the removal of eye makeup as it lifts it away instantly and the product doesn’t compromise your vision if accidently absorbed by eye.  Washing your hands it comes off immediately and disintegrates with water.   A quick wipe off with a “make up eraser” cloth and your skin is ready for your nightly treatment.   There is zero residue left from the product and your skin feels supple and clean.  A must have for this girl.,1.0
"I receive my product with what looks to be finger prints in the middle.. although the product was sealed, I just feel like $68 dollars is just too much to spend to not receive a full jar of the product. On top of that, i would have to pay out of pocket just to ship it back in which I don’t think is fair. There should be a paid shipping label for mistakes like this. I rated one star because if the product comes like this, I will not recommend buying.",0.0
I’ve only been using this for a week or two. I have really read cheeks and this seems to help a little. I feel like I need to give it more time. You do NOT need much at all. If you put too much it makes you look pastey and cakey. My coworkers have been saying my skin looks a lot better. It does feel a little tacky and the smell is not that great. I have really dry skin so this helps with keeping in moisture but I don’t think I would recommend for oily skin.,1.0
"Very disappointed, it’s totally not worth the hype",0.0
"Truthfully, not a fan. I love the fact that it is so gentle on the skin and it does a fantastic job at removing make up. I found that it was just too oily for my skin and left a residue feeling dispute washing it off with cleanser. I get the sense it probably clogs my pores. I was sent this product from Influenster.",0.0
"I was heart set on loving this product. The cleanser gel lathered well. Once dried my skin did not feel stripped of any oil. My skin felt comfortable. Enjoyed the scent. It was basically natural ingredients, but a had small breakouts every morning after use. I’ve used enough skincare products to make a determination. It was not hormonal nor a breakout I could get pass after a few uses--as I tried. They were fairly small and fine on various parts of my face. Very likely a vitamin allergy in the cleanser or this cleanser is brand exclusive. It doesn’t react well to other brand night time serums and moisturizers. So disappointed.",1.0
Would not recommend these. They do not take makeup off and are not good for the environment. I switched to cleansing oil and my makeup and sunscreen comes off much easier in less time.,0.0
This oxidizes my foundation and makes me look more oily than dewy. :( wanted to love it so badly though. Probably works on skin that’s not so oily or combination skin.,0.0

I wasn’t sure on changing up since I have sensitive skin but this is AMAZING! Smell is a bit strange at first but goes away quickly. I put this on and let it dry for a minute before putting on makeup and it’s perfect. Very moisturizing.,1.0
Smells amazing BUT that’s not what skincare is all about. I truly didn’t see a difference after emptying the container & felt that I’ve used cheaper moisturizers that do the trick.,0.0
This product dried out my skin to the point of flaming and I have oily skin so this was surprising. Also the packing makes you waste so much product because when you squeeze it so much more than you need comes out. Also there’s sharp pieces of stuff in the exfoliant which are not nice especially around the eye area.,0.0
"I have tried a lot of eye products because not only do I have a natural dark pigment under my eyes but I also have slightly sunken in under eyes, which means no amount of concealer can get rid of the tired look until I found this!! I was skeptical because of the price but after 2 days I was imediently seeing results!! This not only lightened the dark circles under my eyes but filled in the sunked lines under my eyes!! No more tired eyes! This product is absolutely amazing I recommend it to anyone with tired looking eyes, not just dark circles!!",1.0
"I have been using it nightly for about a month and I now dont think I’ll be able to go without it! I’m in my mid thirties and my biggest skincare concerns are that My skin is chronically dry but also sensitive. I have a tendency to get crusty patches throughout my T-zone, especially between my brows. This combined with the DE night serum has really transformed my face. My skin looks and  feels plump and hydrated. I have experienced no irritation with this product at all. My nighttime routine routine is the DE glycolic serum then first aid beauty moisturizer, followed by one pump of the protini. The price is steep, but a little goes a long way. I also like any face product that I don’t have to stick my fingers in. As a lover of all things skincare, I personally feel protini is a good investment.",1.0
"I received this through Influenster to try out, and I am so happy that I did! The exfoliating rice and hyaluronic acid make for a great combo for my skin. It is gentle enough for my sensitive skin as well! Tatcha as usual is killing it <3",1.0
Packaging is great. I love the pump. The product leaves my skin like I have just gotten a facial. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out. I notice a reduction in fine lines after use. My one problem is the fragrance. It’s overpoweringly sweet. To have that sweet scent on my face for 15 minutes is a little much. I was gifted this product by Influenster,1.0
"Got the SK-II cleanser, toner, essence, and lotion kit as part of a VoxBox campaign. I am 26 so I prefer drying lotions/toners with moisture so I don’t breakout. This product combo definitely was anti-aging but won’t make you breakout. Product smells great also!",1.0

"I was so excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. I don’t write reviews very often but this product has hurt my lips so bad that I felt I should say something. My daughter and I used this product the same night and both woke up very uncomfortable. Luckily my daughter felt better the next day, just said her lips were very dry and tight. Mine felt like that the first part of the day and then the whole top layer of skin came off. It has been a week now and they are still extremely chapped, painful, red, rough, and peeling. At this point I’m starting to get worried that using this product has damaged my lips. I’m using coconut oil, vaseline, and some other lip balms to try to heal them. It’s like having the worst chapped lips in the middle of winter, only it’s almost summer. I do not have sensitive skin and have never reacted to any other lip product. The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because it smells delightful, the packaging is cute, and I loved the little spatula with carrying case that came with it. I will be returning this product.",0.0
I love this stuff! My skin always looks better immediately after using. I don’t use it more than once a week for no longer than 10 minutes because it will dry my skin out.,1.0
"I received the wrinkle correcting serum via Top Box for a review #freeproduct. I used the sample in the morning for 5-6 days.

I didn’t see any change in my skin firmness, like other serums.",0.0
I received this product free from Influenster to try and give an on review and the first thing I can say is wow! This product works great it lightened some old acne scars and makes my skin glow and I have been using it one week. I love this toner!!!!! Again this was a free complimentary product to try and give my honest free.,1.0
I received this product free in response for my opinion in the product. After two weeks of using this product I have noticed alot of difference. Fine lines are minimalized with the orbital area under and around the eye...it made my skin more glowy as well...and under makeup it added a glow as well. This product has very little scent and it doesn’t require alot of product for around the eyes. It can get greasy easily so minimal application works best to avoid this. I also noticed the product is kind of heavy not very light but it still works seamlessly with application. The spoon that comes with the product is useful also in making sure you arent using too much cream.,1.0
"My absolute favorite, it makes my skin so smooth and clear. I used this pre- and post-Accutane. Before, it worked well but sometimes I would get problem zits. This is why I don’t believe in silver bullet products, genetics and personal health have so much to do with how our bodies function, no matter how much product you put on. Anyway, my skin still looked pretty good and I noticed the zits cleared much faster; like in a day with proper care. I had to stop acids while on accutane, but after about 4 mo off I phased it in again. I was getting these tiny tiny pimples on my cheeks. This stuff wiped it out. My skin has not been this clear since I was a kid! Most of my scars have faded except for some deep ones, but honestly I do not care. I haven’t had a zit in over a month and that hasn’t happened in over 13 years.",1.0
"my forehead was breaking out the worst it’s ever been. all i’d been using was a face wash, and moisturizer. i decided to go back to using this toner after trying it out for a couple weeks a long time ago, and put just a little bit in my hands and patted it into my face in the morning right after washing my face, and right after night showers. i didn’t put a lot just to be careful. the pictures are 3 days apart, jan 1, and jan 4. the results were crazy. not sure if it was just because of this product, but either way, i’m happy how it turned out.",1.0

"I wanted to love this. I don’t like wearing heavy foundation. This seems like a nice alternative. It contains sunscreen and has light coverage. The problem is that the product is really drying and caused my skin to get flakey and peel. It also settles into every line.

"Eh. Not really a fan. I regularly have oily skin, super oily, when it’s not managed along with large pores and blackheads covering my t zone. They aren’t too noticeable except on my nose, but I notice them. I tried this twice. The first time a few weeks and didn’t really see a difference. The second time I gave it 5 weeks using it only in the AM because I was using retinol at night. I seen no results or difference in my face. I started using the Inkey List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser for a week and seen better results (even though that is drying as well) the texture of my face is better and can noticeably see the surface of my skin slightly changing. I heard great things about Murad and bought a bunch of their products, but this is one I can definitely and will live without.",0.0

"I got this product complimentary from influenster and absolutely love it. I’ve been using it as a primer on my face before putting on makeup. I like how it doesn’t have the silicon feel and you can feel it nourishing your skin. This helps your skin stay glowing all day long.  I have super sensitive skin and it has not irritated it at all, which is a huge plus. Also, the smell is very subtle and not overwhelming like some products are. I highly recommend getting this!",1.0
I really wanted to love this product as it has amazing reviews. I got a sample at first,0.0
"I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I am happy with it, the only downside is that it leaves a white film on my skin. I guess if you have lighter skin, this would not be a problem, but I spent more time outside this summer than usual. It goes on very smooth, has a luxurious feel, the packaging is great, it’s easy to apply and great under makeup as it serves as a primer as well.  It gives a matte finish. All in all, not a bad sunscreen.",1.0
"I had high hopes for this cleanser but was left disappointed, I have combo acne prone skin and didn’t find it was effectively cleaning my skin and pores, and it didn’t really feel “clean” after using. Also not the biggest fan of the glass bottle, in the evening I wash my face in the shower and was so terrified the Bottle would break.",0.0
Save your money. This did nothing except dry my skin out and cause irritation. It feels like a dry oil (does that make sense?) and never fully absorbs into skin. It smells nice but that is about all this product has going for it. Tried to salvage this and use it on my cuticles...holy hangnails. Can’t win with this stuff.,0.0
Something has changed... either my ski or this moisturizer - I used it last year during the winter. I kinda liked it and finished a jar even tho I wasn’t a fan of the packaging. This year since many people has spoken high about it I just wanted to give it another try. But no.. it irritated my skin so badly... after using it the first time my face was super itchy and once I stopped using it my face was fine. Don’t know what’s wrong with it. Too bad I never thought a product I’ve used before would irritate my skin so I don’t even have the box anymore to return it :/,0.0

Hyaluronic acid improves penetration of your other products, so thats also a possibility, but I have not had this issue before, ever, and my skin is the least sensitive. I’ve even just cut out all actives and used this alone with a simple moisturizer and it still caused a massive break out and irritation.The fragrance in this honestly isn’t crazy or over powering and it actually smells very nice, just wish that it or whatever in this product that doesn’t play well with my skin wasnt in there!",0.0

This cleanser leaves my skin feeling so soft! I’m acne prone and deal with redness and this cleanser has really helped my skin. I love that its sulfate free but still has a gentle lather and takes away all traces of my full coverage foundation. Also great that I don’t need to use a toner afterwards.,1.0
Awful for my skin. Greasy and caused such irritation I only used it a couple times and quit. I don’t have super sensitive skin but this made it feel as if I did. Luckily for me it was a gift.,0.0
Please make without perfume in it!!! Love this product gives you such a nice glowy natural tan the only complaint I have is the perfume in it. It’s a good smell but I feel like I’m rubbing harmful perfume all over my face. If it wasn’t for that ingredient I’d give it 5 stars.,1.0

THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST CLEANSER I HAVE EVER USED. AFTER 10 DAYS MY SKIN FEELS SO MUCH SMOOTHER AND CLEANER. I RARELY WRITE REVIEWS BUT I CAN’T HELP IT— the world needs to know!!! I was never excited about cleansers and thought they were very basic but there is a huge difference in this bottle.,1.0
This eye cream is amazing! It keeps my eye area super moisturized and plump. I wear it at night and my skin is still hydrated when I wash my face the next morning. This stuff is going to last you a while since you only need to apply a little bit. 100% will repurchase!,1.0

"I wasn’t a huge fan when I first used it, but once I had it for about a week, the heat of my house softened the product juuust enough to where it wasn’t a struggle to get out the tube and now I absolutely love it. So much better than the Farmacy Green Clean cleansing balm for 1/4 the price, no microplastics, and no fragrant ingredients that irritate my skin.",1.0
"My skin: fair, combination leaning oily, somewhat acne-prone, some areas of rosacea on my cheeks. Not quite “sensitive“ but can get angry sometimes. I received this as a mini and was excited to try it - I love combo chemical/physical exfoliants. However, the texture of this stuff is so strange, I can’t imagine ever buying the full size. It’s like a thicker face wash with small grains in it, but when you apply it, the liquid part seems to disappear immediately and the grains become these soft blobs/pills. If you’ve ever rubbed on an area of dead, flaking skin, that’s what it felt like scrubbing my face with this (and no, that wasn’t just my skin being exfoliated off!). The exfoliation was decent, but only if you scrub one area at a time and reapply the wash between areas. It was more of a “stripping“ exfoliation than some other chemical scrubs I’ve tried, so take caution if you have dry skin to begin with. I don’t normally care about the smells of products that I just wash off my face, but in case someone does, it smells like a more acidic and pineapple-y cheap sunscreen. Overall, a good concept, but a strange execution.",0.0

The logo for the new product is 2D . I love the old design. And I also think that the size of the new one is smaller than the old one a little bit. Although the label show that they are the same size, I still think that they are not. Besides, the price went up. 105 for a bottle is not a good new for me. I would think about changing a new skincare since Tatcha made me feel uncomfortable both the price and the design.",0.0

The smell of this lip mask is amazing. I also think it has a nice texture. However I’m not sure it is doing much for my lips other than maintain the moisture I already have. The instructions say to put on a heavy layer and rinse off the excess in the morning but no matter how much I put on I never find any left in the morning. If you already have nice lips this will definitely maintain but I’m not sure it would help to heal or add much to your lips.,0.0

"I received this product as part of a free 500 point gift, and was not impressed. The cream is very thick, requiring me to pull at the skin around my eyes to try to rub it in.

One thing about this product is that dry my skin a little but it’s okay because I apply the moisturizer right after and it goes back to looking fresh and normal. If you buy this face wash you should also buy the moisturizer that goes with that face wash. I also have the most sensitive skin and all the products that I bought before made it worse… but this face wash did not hurt my skin at all.",1.0

However it left around my cheeks and nose extremely dry. Dry to the point where when I put makeup on it looked flakey. Overall I really liked this product. It had a decent smell and texture. It wont be something I will keep in my daily routine but I would use it a couple times a week.",1.0
"I tried this with nothing on my face and still had pilling. I always use 2 fingers of sunscreen and maybe it’s due to putting too much at once and you may have to work in sections but personally I don’t wanna have to spend more time slowly blending in my sunscreen when there are so many other better and more affordable options.

I thought MAYBE it was something else I had been doing, but I have not added anything new, and when I stop using it, I stop breaking out. I do think its a beautiful cream, however, because it breaks me out now, this will be the last jar I purchase. Its extremely hydrating, and I could see this being really amazing for someone with more mature skin, or someone younger like myself who does struggle with dehydrated, dry skin.",0.0

This tightening effect is powerful, it’s working...I mean really working! I don’t know what it is about charcoal but man oh man is it a good thing to keep in your beauty regimen.

It’s pleasant and feels like a slightly more mature fragrance. While I do like fragrant skincare, I would have preferred it to be a bit more subtle.

The comforting gel texture absorbs right into the skin and makes it soft and glowing. It also doesn’t clog pores or give you a heavy feel.

I’m SUPER into this mask! I was skeptical when I received it complimentary (opinions are my own) but I fell in love! It’s super easy to apply and a fun greenish blue color. My skin feels clean and smooth after use and the “cold plunge“ is a cooling tingle which I LOVE. I’d definitely recommend!,1.0
"This product seemed to help with the moisture of my skin as well as its appearance very much after first using it.  It has no fragrance and is really easily absorbed. I’ve noticed a nice radiance in my skin after my morning routine as well as some regained elasticity in places like my smile lines.  I also didn’t notice a major difference in my hyperpigmentation.  The downfall to this product is the greasy feeling I wake up to after using this product at night! y skin is naturally oily, and I feel like this product increases that a tad bit. I have used it in the am and pm, and find that in combination with some products that typically dry me out (aka some sunscreens) this helps my skin to stay supple and moist throughout the day!  The only other wish I have is that the formula was a tad back thicker. other than thatz its a great product to add into your skincare routine once you find the way to make it work for you!",1.0
I’ve tried a lot of essences but this one takes the cake. I’ve found that American toners tend to strip my skin of its natural oils whereas this product soothes and replenishes my skin barrier.

Positive: This product is very effective and will reduce the life of an incoming blemish.  Negative: The smell of the sulfur is really overwhelming.  It lingers (because it soaks in) and won’t wash off. The smell is such that I hesitate to use it unless it’s really dire because catching whiffs of rotten eggs during the treatment is almost not worth it.,0.0
the texture is soft and doesn’t leave a sticky residue on my face. My face feels hydrated and this truly does the job. It doesn’t hurt that it has probiotics which is great nourishment for your skin. I will definitely try again.,1.0

This product was gifted by Fresh. Wow this moisturizer is so hydrating and feels so great on my skin. I also like how this formulation is very clean scented and not too overpowering. I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a very effective lightweight moisturizer.,1.0
"I really enjoy this stuff. It’s not as abrasive as some exfoliators, but it’s very effective at removing any dry skin flakes I have sometimes. It also seems to help with controlling the oil production. It makes my face feel baby soft and smooth. It has a light mineral type of smell, or like a clay smell, but it goes away as soon as I rinse it off. I have tried mixing it with a little bit of foaming face wash which works nicely too.",1.0
"I think if you have dry skin, you will love it. However if you have combination or oily skin it’s going to have to be a no, for me anyway. The product is very heavy and I can deal with that if it absorbs well enough to be invisible…. It does not. My skin did glow though but I’m not sure if that was because of the shininess. Also smells good… clean and perfumey-like…",0.0
It was okay. I’d give it a 2.5/5. I felt it was so thick that I need a lot of product to spread. I finished the bottle so quickly my moisturizers usually last me six months but not this one. Love that it’s vegan beauty though.,0.0
"I literally NEVER EVER write a review on anything but with this MAGIC POTION I just had too. I received this and the lip collagen just 3 days ago. I have been using it for 3 days now, in the morning and night.... I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. My skin is glowing and it’s so even! Mornings, I use it under my moisturizer and make up. Evenings, I wash my face, use a toner, liquid collagen and then my facial oils and a face roller. I can wait to see what happen in 30 days!! I’m so please and excited to see more results! Will be repruchasing along with the lip collagen.. which def plumped my lips and smooth out some lines!  I gave it a 4 star rating only because on both the Liquid Collagen and Lip Collagen the packing is a bit hard to use..",1.0
"If you’re sensitive to smell you’ll literally hate this product. The consistency is sticky when you pour it on a cotton pad, luckily it doesn’t stay on your skin sticky.

"I saw some reviews and I noticed that this serum in particularly is better when mixed with a moisturizer, so I got my sample of this serum (which I trade with my points) and mixed with avocado sleeping mask by glow recipe, and I must tell you, my skin felt amazing!

"Start 2 weeks ago, wait , İ took photo fot before / after , update result",1.0
This changed my life. My skin texture has changed for the better! Everything has just smoothed and my skin is beyond soft. I also use Glow Recipe watermelon toner along with it. When I apply my makeup on top of this it’s out of this world soft and hydrated when my skin used to be very dull. Highly recommended will buy this again and again.,1.0
"Y’all I have been suffering from dryness on my face, pimples and fungal acne for years. I’ve spent so much money on diff products but I saw so many reviews on this product so I thought I’d give it a try. I used this once a week. Their niacinamide in the am and the lactic acid in the pm combined with a good moisturizer has COMPLETELY transformed my skin. Highly recommend",1.0
SKINLONGEVITY LONG LIFE HERB SERUM by Bareminerals is okay. I got a sample but wasn’t impressed. The sample was very small so maybe that was the problem but it didn’t leave a long last impression. It soaked into my skin nicely and made it feel nice but no life changing results. Meh.,0.0
"I received this complimentary from Influenster. I really like this sunscreen, I think it’s great. It doesn’t have that normal sunscreen smell and it doesn’t leave a white cast.

"I imagine that these are great of you don’t have sensitive skin. However, whatever adhesive they use causes a huge red circle to be left behind after I remove the dot.

"I received this as a complimentary sample from Influenster. I’m not typically one for scented products because of my sensitive skin..but this toner is EVERYTHING. Starting with the packaging, the bottle is one of the most gorgeous, simplistic designs I’ve seen for a skin care product. Feels heavy duty so it could probably withstand a short fall although I haven’t tested it. The product itself is a pretty pale pink color. The scent is a little on the stronger side but it isn’t suffocating. It almost smells a little peppery, but mostly is true to the “watermelon” label. The consistency is a little thick but still liquid, which I found unusual because all the other toners I’ve tried are very watery. Now the part everyone actually cares about: is this toner worth your money? I absolutely think so. While I’d always advise against fragranced skin care, this product really does seem to do its job well. I have a really bad case of nose blackheads that have never really gone away until about a month’s use of this toner. It’s very cool on the skin and doesn’t irritate my sensitive face. It’s no miracle, but it’s pretty dang close. All in all, a good quality toner that I believe is worth the price.",1.0
"Didn’t do anything for me, but maybe it’s just my really stubborn dark circles. Would not buy it again. Thankfully it was not very expensive.",0.0
"I received a sample sized product from my friend who got this at Sephora. We both have the cream and I absolutely love the cooling effect of the water cream when you apply it. It has a nice fragrance/smell to it too. Unfortunately my face broke out after using this cream. I normally only get some acne on my forehead once in a while. But with this cream I had small little pimples forming on my cheeks, chin area and even more noticeable pimples on my forehead. My friend is also using the same product but it works well for her. Overall I would recommend testing a small amount first to see if your skin has any kind of reaction to it. I have oily skin.",0.0
I was so sad about this product. It made my face sting like crazy and I got what looked like a sunburn. Beware!!!!,0.0
I have been using this product for over 1 month and I haven’t noticed any changes in my skin other than hydration. It smells good and doesn’t leave my skin sticky. I will recommend this product as a hydration serum. And Thanks for this good products at very reasonable price.#skinlongevity #cleanbeauty #contest #complimentary @bareminerals @Influenster,1.0

"I wanted to love this product, but unfortunately it was not for me. After testing a small amount on my forearm as directed at first I didn’t notice any reaction so I went ahead and used it. But after using it for a second time my face began to feel warm and itch. When I looked in the mirror I noticed small bumps all over my face. My skin is used to prescribed retinol and cleared my skin of any sort of acne. So I thought this version would of worked for me since now I am breastfeeding and was told to not use retinol. I will be returning both the morning serum and night creme and hope my skin goes back to normal in the next coming days.",0.0

Some things I did like though is the packaging which is really cute, the smell is nice too? lol",0.0
Unbelievable how many raving reviews there are. This just sits on top of your lips and doesn’t moisturize at all. Get the agave lip mask from bite beauty instead; it’s 10x better,0.0
I had high hopes after reading great reviews of this product but it’s weird.  It feels like Vaseline and it doesn’t clean my skin. I hate that thick awful greasy feel of it on my skin.  It did not remove my makeup and it takes a lot to wash off. I had to use a hot towel to help it take the greasy feel off my skin. This might be good for people who don’t wear makeup with very dry skin otherwise it’s just a strange product. I’m also confused at all the rave reviews. How am I using this wrong and unsuccessfully ?!!! I’ve tried it multiple times and  it’s awful. I don’t return products as they trash them so I will use this as a hydrating mask after I cleanse with a better cleanser.,0.0
"This is meant for oily skin, which I have, but it makes me even oilier. It still moisturizes but that’s all it does. Don’t waste your  buck and get a drugstore moisturizer that would do more than this.",0.0
"This is a good oil. Argan oil is wonderful. It’s so moisturizing, and non comedogenic. But if you’re wondering if this particular argan oil is better than other argan oils out there that are priced lower, I would have to say no. This is a pretty standard argan oil. That being said, I did like it and enjoyed using it.",0.0
"This is a miracle!!! Firstly, a little goes a long way!! You really only need a bit since this is so moisturizing and thick and you also get quite a bit (remember it’s only for your lips, so that being said it’s a lot) so this will last you A LONG TIME even with every night use. It smells and feels amazing too!! What I do is put a bit on before I go to sleep (I keep it by my bed so on nights when my lips are extremely dry I can apply a second time if I wake up in the night) and when I walk up... GIRLLLLL!!! My lips are plump, super soft, and smooth!! I find it also brings out my lips natural colour.",1.0
It’s not a heavy night cream which I enjoy and a little goes a long way BUT I cannot stand the smell. I guess it’s like lemon or peach? I do not like the scent at all whatever it is. I think I can find a better night cream without this strong lemon fragrance smell.,0.0
This product is not worth buying. It does not get rid of fine lines and does not allow my makeup to last. Just with cetapil moisturizer alone it started peeling off,0.0

"Wow.  For the price and reputation of Tatcha, I was so looking forward to using this.  Unfortunately, it feels like it never dries!  My skin feels tacky and it just does not absorb at all!... I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with oily skin.",0.0
I was apprehensive at first as my skin tends to lean towards the more oily side but I have been impressed with this! I haven’t used many gel moisturizes in the past but this way made my skin feel cool and refreshed. I used it on both my face and my hands.,1.0
I loved the feel and consistency of this Serum. It’s very lightweight and goes in with a silky feel and finish. I also love that there isn’t a string scent. But I saw very little results as in wrinkles and fine lines. I feel it’s just a good hydrating serum.,0.0
"This mask is pretty “ok”. It has a beautiful rose color initially but turns lighter when it dries. I have a sensitive spot under my nose that gets super dry. This mask made that spot burn and redden but it was fine on the rest of my face. It did make my skin feel mice but nothing extraordinary, like it felt “nice” like any other mask or wash. It was kind of annoying that your face has to be completely dry when you put it on because you have to wash your face first but it wasn’t a deal breaker. The fragrance was not too strong but it definitely had a scent. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",0.0
"Great basic moisturizer. Goes on very well, I’d say it’s good for dry to combination skin. No real sensitizing ingredients so good for sensitive skin.",1.0

"I live in Tucson AZ and in the desert staying moisturized is sometimes difficult. I also have allergies so dry, chapped lips has always been a regular issue for me. Not anymore with this stuff! I have gotten compliments from family and friends on how much better they look. I had some reservations with it being in a jar because I don’t like applying stuff with my fingers (with nails it can get messy) but there is an applicator spatula that takes care of that too!",1.0
"Was extremely excited to get my hands on this, and I love the packaging and the ritual they’ve created with the little wand applicator.

"I suffer from severe rosacea and this stuff really helps calm my skin. It won’t cure rosacea and you’ll still be red, but it helps reduce the redness a little.

Started using this about three weeks ago because I’ve been having some breakouts and needed something to help with that I have oily skin and large pores I feel like this product highlights every break out you have you’ll notice more after washing than before you did definitely recommend using some kind of acne medicine like differin gel.. this cleaner alone will not get rid of acne after using leaves your skin with a sort of minty sensation overall it’s a good product after daily use haven’t noticed much of a difference abut also keep in mind everyone’s skin is different so what doesn’t work for me probably works for you !,0.0
"Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE tacha products and have been more than satisfied with past products. So I was super excited to receive this product for review purposes, but this one is... Just fine. The serum itself is very moisturizing, I use it on my lips and around my eyes, but I don’t think the stick is the best delivery method. I almost always forget to use it in my routine and often wonder if I’m using it to its best potential. Just doesn’t fill an essential role in my skincare routine.",0.0

"I had high hopes for this stuff and am very disappointed in it. First, it smells divine and although I generally dislike frangrance in my face products, it’s very common in lip products and doesn’t bother me so I was happy about that. That’s where the positives end though, this does nothing to moisturize my lips. It contains Shea butter but it’s low on the list and most the other ingredients are occlusives so it may work for someone who’s lips are already very hydrated to keep them from drying out but doesn’t moisterize my dry lips at all. I’ve been layering it over an actual moisturizing lip product to use it up but won’t repurchase. It’s also very messy, when you spread it on your lips it gets all over and makes a goopy mess everywhere. I’d imagine someone with acne could have problems with this blocking pores around their mouth. Overall, it’s pretty disappointing and I can’t  think of anyone who would see any benefit from this silly product.",0.0
"Wow, I’ve never had a bad experience with a moisturizer ever. I put this on my face before bed and woke up with extremely tight and itchy skin the next morning.

It tingled my face quite a bit. When I woke up in the morning and rinsed my face, it was left feeling tight and try.- I tried it a few days later as a 10-min mask, and tingled my face a lot again. When I washed it off, my face was really tingly/itchy, and my skin felt tight and dehydrated. - I tried it as a primer, and it made my makeup pill and flake.

It is a bit sticky, so I don’t recommend wearing it during the day! However, it is so relaxing to just apply this every night right before bed.  I have also had this product for over 6 months, and I apply it super generously. BUY THIS. FOR REAL.",1.0

Had no expectations and will prob never go without this again!",1.0

The product itself is good. Is creamy and hydrating. But oh my goodness it has a overwhelming perfume scent. Is a deal breaker for me. Why add to a perfectly good product perfume scent?!!

"I really wanted to love this product based on all of the positive reviews but unfortunately it just ended up breaking me out. I have acne scars and the occasional breakout and thought that adding this toner to my routine would only help my skin. It wasn’t harsh on my skin but just kept breaking me out. I decided to try it for a couple of weeks and after my breakouts kept getting worse, I just had to stop.",0.0
Initially I was very skeptical about this product because I just thought it was too good to be true. I ordered the smaller jar and it’s been empty for about a week and it’s killing me!!

It feels silly smooth and absorbs perfectly leaving my skin feeling soft, healthy and hydrated.",1.0
"I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays to try out in exchange for my honest review. I actually love that this is a non fragrance product, as I hate scent-y things on my face. It’s a product that doesn’t need to be rinsed either, which is sort of a pro, but it just feels quite heavy on one’s face - which can be a pro and con at once lol. I’d say it’s super hydrating so definitely useful for those that need it. My face isn’t the dryest and is more combo, but I thought it was nice overall. A little goes a long way!",1.0
"This product is not intended to replace any hydrator or moisturizer, it is more of a feel good product and that is exactly what it does for me. It refreshes me when I spray it after putting makeup on. I also bring a small one to work when my skin is feeling blehhhh at work. My boyfriend who refuses to put any skincare on his face also loves this spray. I picked this over the avene mist because I saw somewhere that applying just water to the skin can actually draw out hydration from the skin. So if this is grape water... it would be more hydrating?",1.0
Nice lightweight moisturizer for my normal to oily skin. Didn’t break out my very acne-prone skin and provided adequate moisturization without being too heavy. I found it pretty mediocre for the price though. There are much cheaper moisturizers (esp from Korea) that can achieve the same results.,0.0

"I love this product! It makes my skin feel so soft whenever I use it, and doesn’t make my rosacea flare up (which is really rare for me, many products do). While it is quite expensive, one normal sized container lasts over a year for me easily. I use it a few times a week because my skin is very sensitive, but this is the only exfoliator I have ever used that I could use daily or every other day if I wanted to. It took using this 4 days in a row for my skin to get irritated at all, and it was only mild. So if your skin is less sensitive im sure you could use this daily.

"This is literally that post facial baby skin you get at spas in a container! I love me a good exfoliator and I have learned over the years that you should be very picky about which exfoliators you use because some do more damage to your skin than benefits. I absolutely loved this one because it did give you that baby soft skin afterwards from the mineral exfoliating beads combined with glycolic acid which is a staple chemical exfoliant so you got double the power. It also contains Australian Kakadu Plum which is a strong vitamin C so you repairing your skin with antioxidants. Now for the cons, this item is pricy at $125 for 1.7oz so I can’t justify the price when there are so many other exfoliants for cheaper. Also another problem I had is that it uses micro-exfoliating beads that to my knowledge are not biodegradable. We only have one planet so we should love it and take actions to protect it. Though in terms of how well this product worked, I definitely felt that it removed all the dead skin cells allowing for my skincare products to work at their best.",0.0

During this time my skin cleared up some, but I decided to give it another try to make sure it wasn’t something else that had messed up my skin because I really wanted it to work. Now my skin is so broken out that without makeup it looks like I have a rash on my face. The only good thing I can say is that it does remove makeup well, so I am going to use up the rest by only using it to remove my eye makeup.",0.0
"Got this to try as a reef-safe, clean sunscreen.  Not a terrible product.  A little slimy but dries ok.  That said it is NOT reef safe!  It has Homosalate 8%, Octocrylene 4%,both are on the banned list of ingredients.  Savethereef and Surfrider both have easy lists to access.  I can’t understand how Supergoop writes that label and Sephora sells it with that label.  Do better!",0.0
This product isn’t worth the hype it’s over priced and they’re are so many cheaper options that do a job better. A great alternative is the anti redness bb cream from Maybelline.,0.0
Drunk Elephant is the best skin care choice I’ve made ever. One needs to go in depth behind the founder’s story to really appreciate the product - I mean the results speak for themselves in my case. But what drew me near is the story. There’s a trust I have for this company - i have tried every single Drunk Elephant skin product. No joke. Their philosophy makes so much sense. The founder seems so genuine and i love how they connect with the social media community.  And they’re so so so responsive- by email and direct message on Instagram.,1.0
"Stunning. I love this moisturizer, it’s light but still effective. The smell is absolutely to die for. I’ve had only good luck with this product and I highly recommend!",1.0
I received this mask as a sample. I didn’t like smell and it was too strong for my sensitive skin even with the shorter leave on time :(. Left my skin looking red and blotchy and the consistency feels like goo. Not a fan.,0.0
"I really wanted to love this product with all the promising reviews and the amazing 50% off January skincare sales but it just did nothing for me.  In fact, it probably undid all the supple moisturizing from my Tatcha products.  Bought 4 bottles and unfortunately will be returning it.",0.0
"Super creamy and smells amazing.Definitely something different that I haven’t tried because usually serums are liquid, this one isn’t.It does leave you skin feeling soft and I have to say I hope they have a whole collection!",1.0
1000% recommended this toner. & I love the texture and the scent.,1.0
I received this as a free sample for my birthday gift. Every time I’ve tried to use this product (3x was enough) the very next day I woke up with several tiny bumps all over my face. I have combination/oily skin and my skin has been acne free for years by maintaining a good skincare/hygiene routine. So I know that it’s the product that is causing the problems with my skin. Causes blackheads and little whiteheads so oily skin beware!!! Normal skin could probably get away with using the smallest amount all over your face. Maybe someone with dry skin can use this without problems. I think the moisturizer is so thick and full of ingredients that clogs my pores.,0.0
okay…do I think this is the best lip balm ever?? Not exactly…BUT it’s so cute and seeing it sit on my shelf makes me happy. Would I repurchase this? probably not just because of the price. But it is cute,0.0
"Price: 10/10Product Effectiveness: 9/10 Packaging: 6/10Lots of people compare this as a dupe to the Pixi glow tonic, i would agree with that but i think that the Pixi is gentler and better for daily use.This toner has good strength and exfoliates nicely so it can be used 2-3 times a week and still have resultsThe bottle dispenses way too much product to use as directed for daily use and will cause irritation and over exfoliation (even after my skin has been used to acids) , transfer the product to an empty misting bottle and the product becomes much more gentle on the skin and more comparable to the pixi one, just a gentle daily exfoliating toner to brighten skin toneOnly 4 stars because of the bottle. I purchased this product from the Deciem website but decided to review it hereAlso great for use on the body!",1.0
"This stuff is amazing! It lifts eyes after being tired, or just not getting enough sleep! Doesn’t require much, a little goes a long way. Highly recommend!",1.0
Best make-up remover and cleanser ever! it goes on so soft and smooth and my skin feels super clean after. I use this to remove my makeup and follow with the Youth to the People Kale Cleanser and have noticed an improvement with my skin.,1.0
This really irritated my combo skin. It felt tight after use and my redness came right out.,0.0
"I had been interested in trying a facial oil again after trying the argan oil from Josie Maran a few years back. After doing extensive research, I learned about the science behind Biossance and the organizations they donate to and loved everything about it. It does what it says: moisturizes even in the dead of winter (I live in New York so it gets pretty dry and cold here) and doesn’t bother my combo/dry skin. I also love that it has rose oil in it! Needless to say, I’ve been repurchasing this bottle ever since.",1.0
No breakouts! No clogged pores! No greasy face! Doesn’t irritate the skin or sting the eyes. This is a winner for me!! I’ve been using it everyday for the past 2-3 weeks as the last step of my morning skin care routine. There is an unpleasant scent so it did take me a week before I stopped noticing it. I just wished it was more affordable. I would have given it 5 stars if the price was lower.,1.0
I have combination skin but it is more on the dry side. This cream broke me out and made me super oily. I would wash my face and as soon as I’d apply the product my face looked dirty and my pores were visibly clogged. Never buying again!,0.0
"I have oily/combination skin and am acne-prone, bought this cleanser after seeing Hyram rave about it and reading so many positive reviews. It didn’t cause me any irritation or breakouts and my skin definitely feels clean afterwards. However, taking off 1 star because after I wash my face, it feels dry/tight and like I need to immediately moisturize. This makes me think that this cleanser is a bit too stripping/harsh even for my oily skin. I bought the mini size to try it out and will finish that, but am planning to try the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp cleanser afterwards as I’ve heard that one is gentler and good for all skin types.",0.0
"Every night I apply this with moisturizer and bio oil I wake up with such an even skin tone, ZERO redness, and an overall glow. Definitely adding it to my fulltime rotation",1.0
"Didn’t do much, don’t waste your $$! I have tried this product and really wanted to love it, it has great ingredients and the brand is usually a hit. This product didn’t really moisturize, it would almost dry my skin after the application. I think there are better products out there for better price and better performance.",0.0
This really does help with dry skin. I try other lotions and always come back to this one. Thicker cream. Not really a smell to it. Recommend putting it on while your skin is still kind of damp from your shower.,1.0
"I absolutely love this serum. It gives me a glow-from-within look, evens out my skin tone, and smooths out the texture of my skin. If I’m too lazy or tired for a full routine I would just use a toner, this serum, and any moisturizer on top (even cheap moisturizers will do). My friends always compliment me on my skin, even the ones with perfect skin feels “intimidated“ around me (their words) and I have to credit this serum for the wonderful effects it’s had on my face. Can’t live without this product. And for under $20/bottle it’s such a steal!",1.0
"First of all the tint of this matches and enhances my lips PERFECTLY.  It feels amazing, the spread is like butter on my lips and it stays on my lips for awhile while I’m talking all night ! I’m in love with the design too because the lid doesn’t fall off and make a mess. So happy I got this gifted by fresh and will be repurchasing for family !",1.0

"I have a dry chin area that tends to get red, as opposed to the entirety of my face (which is combination). I bought the small jar to see if I can relieve the redness since nothing else seems to do the job. Just received my jar today in the mail and applied it on right away; I noticed that a little can go a long way while using this product. Also, it has this opaque green color that will only fade and adapt to your skin color if you keep rubbing it on. The smell is AMAZING -- reminds me of Tiger Balm. I walked away from the mirror for about 5-10 minutes and I happened to catch my reflection again... Y’ALL THIS STUFF WORKS! My redness has faded significantly.The only reason I took off a star is because I would notice that the product would leave a slight flaky residue, probably due to my chin being dry. I would apply moisturizer over it throughout the day to keep it hydrated. Overall, this stuff seems to do the job, pretty surprising since I’m only posting this as an initial reaction. I’m curious as to how it would play over the course of a few months. Would totally recommend though!",1.0
"This is a good option for combination skin if you prefer an extreme light texture. I used this moisturizer after applying toner and niacinamide. I don’t LOVE the texture and feel like it doesn’t hydrate my skin as much as other water creams. Smells really good, works, but it’s just not good bang for the buck.",0.0
Nice and creamy but it sort of just sat on my face. Didn’t really absorb into my skin and made me feel more oily than usual. Might be great for real dry skin.,1.0
This is my first time using a Korres product and I must say that I’m happy. I really love the scent of this. I use this on my cleansing brush and it foams up really well; there’s not a lot of foam. I can’t wait to try more products from this brand.,1.0
I have been using this day and night for about 4 months now and there is still product left. I live in Alaska so deal with very dry and cold temperatures and this cream is perfect for everyday. It wears well under makeup and has a tacky consistency on the skin.,1.0
"This is nothing more than an overpriced lip gloss. It looks pretty on, but once it wears off my lips are actually more dry than before I used it. I don’t notice any plumping, smoothing, or moisturizing effects from this, and won’t repurchase and don’t recommend.",0.0
I love this stuff! It removes my makeup and glue from my lashes. It feels good and last a long time. One of my favorite makeup removers.,1.0
I am addicted to this stuff. It leaves my skin feeling so moisturized and plump. It’s great for my sensitive skin. It’s definitely a skincare staple for me. Definitely will be stocking up on this stuff!,1.0

"I received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox in exchange of my honest review. I was very pleased when I was selected as a tester for this correcting serum. I love Clinique products and I was expecting the best. I tried the correcting serum before going to bed about four days in a row. Unfortunately I haven’t seen any difference with my skin, which is quite deceiving for a costly product like this. In my opinion, this product doesn’t meet the Clinique products standard.",0.0
"A great first cleanser (complimentary from Dermalogica). Even though it is an oil it is not heavy or greasy at all. In fact, it just melts away all the makeup and impurities easily. I can remove even the toughest mascara without being too forceful on my eyes.",1.0

This product was highly disappointing. my face felt unclean after using and it caused some breakouts. I don’t think it deserves the hype its ok at best.,0.0
I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty.   This has such a light and refreshing smell and covers your skin very well.   Makes hydrating easy as it lasts the entire day and there is no need to re-apply.  Very very fresh and I like that feeling.,1.0
"Obsessed. This is the best product for pores that I have ever used. I do love a good charcoal mask, but these are all around better - they are not messy, your pores are not wide open after peeling off like a mask, easy to use while sleeping, and they come with a sweet sticker! Do wish they were more affordable, but sometimes the price is worth it for this great of a product.LOVE LOVE LOVE.",1.0
"Not irritating or problematic, but it doesn’t get the job done. It is refreshing and light, and it feels good on my skin, but the moisture only lasts for 5 minutes. Don’t let the word deep fool you; if you have dry skin, this isn’t a moisturizer that can stand on it’s own. I sometimes use it throughout the day if my skin needs a hydration boost because I don’t want it to be a waste at this price point, but I will not repurchase. (Conversely, I quite enjoy the Superberry Hydrate + Glow Oil. The dream mask is pretty good, but I haven’t seen show-stopping results)",0.0
It broke my skin out with the worst cystic acne. I always had one or two but while using this cream it got 10 times worse! I used in my neck and it broke out as bad as my face. Now I will use the bit left on my hands. I don’t recommend it if you have cystic acne or sensitive skin.,0.0
The pump broke after 1-2 months of use and I don’t know how to declog it. So now I have to open the bottle to use it each time or a lot of product leaks around the pump and goes to waste. If they fixed the pump I’d give it 3/5 stars. Also not noticing much of a change after 2 months of consistent use (with an spf over). :/In the photo you can see residue from where the pump leaks when I use it. And the product is still clear yellow and not orange so it’s still supposed to be potent!,0.0
"Helped my acne so much! I’ve tried it all- Curology, proactive, dermatologists. None of those expensive treatments worked. But this brand. Y’all. I can’t believe it’s that cheap. My skin looks so amazing. I’m so happy.",1.0
"I was really excited to try this bc it’s so hyped up, but I hated it. It felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin in a thick greasy layer and would never actually soak in. It pilled horribly. It’s a no from me.",0.0
"I received the Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliator gifted by GOOPGLOW to try out and leave my honest feedback. I really wanted to love it since I’ve been a big fan of their other products, however, it just wasn’t love for me. I tried it a couple of times a week for almost 2 weeks and the biggest downfall is the smell. It smells like plastic almost, hard to explain. Maybe I received a bad product but it really bothered me. I’ve done Microderm facials a few times but the exfoliator in this product just feels slightly too rough- even with really gentle use, it agitated my skin. I will say that it got rid of the blackheads on my nose which is why I’m giving it 3 stars, but based on the agitation and scent- I would personally skip this product.",0.0
I love the formula of this lip balm!!  It’s very moisturizing and long lasting.  Great for the winter when the cold weather makes my lips so dry.The only thing I don’t like about this balm is that it is so large around.  I feel like it’s wasted on the edges and it gets farther outside my lips then I would like.  It would be better as a more billet shape.,1.0
This is literally nothing more than fancy stinky water that does nothing for my skin and I regret having spent over $100 for it. Thankfully Sephora has an incredible return policy and I was able to get my money back!,0.0
"Bad results, Not worth the high price in my opinion",0.0
I love this brand and their packaging is so detailed. It’s like opening something special every time!  I have  combo skin so a water based moisturizer is important to control oil through the day. This doesn’t leave any residue at all. Feels very clean and fresh!,1.0
"I can’t believe it but this DE product messed up my under eye badly, I’m not even sensitive in general. I developed tenderness and pimple like spots after starting use. After seeing other similar issues with other reviewers, I’m returning. Love so many of their other products but this will be a pass.",0.0
"Love this serum! I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I find my redness has diminished. I still have some redness but it isn’t nearly as bad. I have sensitive, combination acne prone skin and it hasn’t caused me any issues or breakouts! The serum has a really nice texture and it does have a smell but it smells refreshing!",1.0
Amazing love it. Used it for a week and still using it it’s amazing. It does tingle or sting a bit but it does it’s magic. It helps a lot with fine lines and a glowy skin. I recommended this product to my mom and she is using it every night. And loves it thank you influenster for this complementary product I love it.,1.0
"Upon opening it, a bunch of oil came gushing out. I tried it a few times and I found the oil always came out separated. Does remove makeup but it’s very messy having to emulsify the mixture myself. I’ve heard great things about their other products though, so will give those a try!",0.0
"this serum has been ok so far. Ive used it for 7 days in a free sample and have not noticed any visible differences. It feels a bit greasier on my skin than my regular serum though, but I like that it has turmeric in it. It is more expensive that my normal serum so I will probably not be buying this anytime soon.",0.0
"My favorite moisturizer. I’ve repurchased this product at least 5 times. I have combo skin, and this is the only moisturizer that keeps my skin hydrated and soft. I prefer the Lala Retro Whipped Cream to the Protini as this cream is thicker and more occlusive.",1.0
I have 2 large bottles of this left that I had stocked up on. It really is a great product but the trick for me has been to use only at night and use a very tiny amount. It has a tendency to make my skin very oily (I do not have oily skin!) I won’t likely repurchase after I use up what I have just because the consistency is too oily for my liking.,1.0
I usually use the farmacy version of this product but decided to switch it up. big (expensive) mistake. its more greasy and less cleansing. it never full gets ride of my make up and I’m pretty minimal with what I put on. its hard to clean off your skin as well.,0.0
Amazing cleanser! Smells amazing too! I would definitely recommend #Complimentaryfortestingpurposes,1.0
I want to love it because of all the positive reviews but it breaks me out so badly!,0.0
"Pros: feels nice on the skin, Rub between fingers to warm it up before putting on face. Takes off my mascara easily Cons: very hard to remove, doesn’t emulsify much at all, can still feel it on my skin after multiple rinses. Definitely need a second cleanser to get this off my skin. If I use on eyes to remove eye make up I have to keep them closed the entire time until after second cleanse. Makes eyes feel foggy Will use up and not purchase again",0.0
Gifted by Algenist. I’m so happy I was able to try this product! This product feels really good on my skin and I’ve noticed that my skin is smoother and glowy. I also like that it’s not sticky and absorbs into the skin really well! The pump is also easy to use.,1.0
"Tried and true workhorse. Amazing no-frills makeup remover. This balm takes off pretty much all of my eye and face makeup. I only run into snags when I tight line my eyeliner, and/or wear a crap load of mascara.  If my eye makeup really doesn’t want to come off, I’ll use a separate oil based eye makeup remover. Best to use in dry skin, and remove with a damp washcloth.",1.0
"This is a lush cream, but it is too occlusive for my skin. It clogs my pores every time I wear it, such a shame! My skin type is combination and I only used it during the day. It’s a shame it didn’t work since it’s not cheap! I hate to waste the rest of it.",0.0

"I read the reviews carefully on this but I still decided to try it out on my own, even though I shouldn’t have.

Try at your own risk.",0.0

"I got this free from influenster to test out in exchange for my honest review. I have enjoyed using this product overall I’ve had a great experience. I love this product because I noticed after using it after just a week my skin and complexion cleared up. I really think this product was something my skin needed and was missing. It absorbs nicely and just leaves my skin looking and feeling hydrated. I have oily/acne prone skin and this worked great for my skin type. No harsh, strong fragrance that irritated my skin. I really do recommend this to everyone. My only complaint or set back with this was the bottle there is no easy or right way to apply this every single time I tried to apply this to my face and it didn’t matter which way I tried, I always wasted some because it will just spill or come out to fast or just get all over and for the price that is the last thing I want to do! I want every drop. But it’s liquid so it’s a little challenging to apply if they came up with a better way and new design for an application I would say this is 100% worth it. But for that reason I give this a 4.5. Other than that I do think this is a great product! Still worth trying!",1.0
What is this supposed to do exactly?! All it did was form a ton of little clumps which is messy. It’s not skin coming off...face is still dry after. Garbage.,0.0
I received this product as a free sample and have been using it for last ten days. i love how moisturizing. I like that it’s a non greasy eye cream. My under eye is smoother and feels more hydrated. My eyes look brighter and more refreshed in the mornings. i would recommend this eye cream.,1.0
"Love these. Whenever I switch to a different brand I feel like my skin gets super sensitive. I feel like it’s not a bad price point, in comparing to other brands and I also feel like these are way better than makeup wipes (which no matter the brand either feel like I’m stripping my skin or they are not getting everything off.",1.0
The weirdest face wash I have ever purchased. It’s so thick it’s like rubbing Elmers glue on your face. I can’t imagine a product with that consistency could ever get deep in your pores and cleanse. Will not repurchase,0.0

"I never understood the importance or point of using an essence before I received this one from Influenster. I started using this product morning and night before any of my other skincare and after I had deeply cleansed my skin. I used a Shiseido cotton square to apply this to my face but you could just press it into your skin using your fingertips. I noticed that my serum would sink into my skin quicker when I used this product and I also noticed that after a few days of using this product my skin looked more hydrated, brighter, and tighter. I would definitely recommend this product and brand to anyone looking to elevate their skincare experience.",1.0

"I want to start with the packaging. Absolutely aesthetically pleasing and simple. That being said I think the moisturizer is okay and may not be everyone’s cup of tea. It has a fragrance to it, which I don’t mind. It’s not super strong but does stick around for a bit so I thought I would point that out. Also the price is ridiculous! It’s a decent moisturizer but why would you spend more when there’s a plethora of affordable ones out there. It’s also very thicc, not ideal for summer time and oily to combo skin.",0.0

"The packing is so cute, the gel texture is super unique, and I wanted to like this... but what the heck?I’ve been using the laneige lip mask for months... and I love it. I thought I would splurge and maybe find a better lip mask. The first night I used it I woke up, my lips felt their normal plump after using the laneige but it was steadily downhill. That day and the day after I couldn’t figure out why my lips were so dry they hurt and the bottom one was flaking. The next few nights after reading other people’s reviews I didn’t use it made used my laneige and my lips went back to normal. Me thinking maybe it was in my head... I used it again. Firstly, even after it wears off... my lips feel super tacky. Secondly... my lips got super dry again. I don’t know what happened to make the formula so bad but I can’t use this lip mask. I feel like it was a total waste of money... I live too far from a Sephora to justify spending more in gas to return it... so now it just sits and looks pretty on my dresser and I use the little spatula w/ my laneige lip mask.",0.0
This is one of my holy grail products because it is that good! Whenever my skin is rough and has a lot of texture I use this and it dramatically gets rid of all my dry  texture plus my skin is so much smoother and softer. I love that it’s not harsh either on my sensitive face or my rosacea.,1.0
"I use these pads 1-2 days a week and my skin looks great. The ingredients in these pads clear blemishes, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and fine lines and wrinkles!

Using the treatment has given my skin an amazing healthy glow, it looks and feels so healthy and soft. I received this FREE product from PINCHme",1.0

They are pricier, but they come with so many sheets for such good quality that for me it was worth it.",1.0
"I switched to this product after seeing Kathleenlights mention it. I was concerned because she has dry skin and I have oily, but I have truly never loved a moisturizer more.

I can tell that my forehead lines are diminishing!! I’m glad I bought the value size because I absolutely love this product.",1.0

After two days of putting this on before I went to bed I felt like a new person. The skin around my eyes was able to retain it’s natural moisture and some. If I hadn’t received this product when I did I would have gone insane.",1.0

Based on other reviews I thought I would love this product. Unfortunately it has caused one of the worse breakouts I’ve ever had. I am pretty sensitive to fragrance and this product seems to have a pretty strong scent so I’m assuming that’s why it doesn’t work for me. Will be returning.,0.0
"I’ve used this moisturizer as apart of my daytime and night time skin care routine for about two weeks now and I love it! I have very oily skin and it moisturizes my skin while mattifying and preventing future breakouts. The other moisturizers I’ve used in the past have left my skin feeling and looking super greasy, but not this one. It also makes your foundation look smooth. The only downside to using this product is the smell. It doesn’t smell the very best but the benefits definitely outweigh the cons. This product is a 10/10.",1.0
"I do not use this product religiously, but I do like the way it feels on my face when used. Only thing that gets me is the price point. It’s very hard to justify a moisturizer at this price.

Nice serum. Leaves skin moisturized and feeling hydrated. With continued use texture of the skin starts to feel better and smoother. A little goes a long way. The packaging is also very nice. Gifted from Fresh.,1.0
A great product really moisturizer my skin and felt a difference in texture.,1.0
"I just finished my first bottle of this and I will probably not repurchase. The pros are that it smells wonderful and that it does leave your face very hydrated. The cons are that it takes a while to settle into your skin, and the product is not a good value. I went through a 60mL bottle in a month 1/2 with daily use (occasional twice daily) on my face and neck.  Cost aside, I think this is a decent moisturizer. I don’t love it, and I don’t hate it.",1.0
I used to think Lush’s Ultrabalm was the holy grail when it came to my lips but this stuff works WONDERS. Added plus it smells great!,1.0
This product is amazing. When you apply this gel on your skin the dead skin cells actually ball up and exfoliate right off! It’s really great when my skin gets dry as it helps take all the flakes right off. You only need this about once a week. At first I wasn’t sure if it was the product itself balling up or actual skin cells so I started testing it by using it a second time and there was barely any balling of the gel. I highly recommend it!!!,1.0
"I am absolutely obsessed with this scrub! The scent is amazing but not overpowering. The scrub does a great job exfoliating and leaves my skin feeling smooth, clean, and clear. I use it about 2-3 times a week. Highly recommend!",1.0
Very overpriced.. this is a basic balm and it melts and wraps so easily! I was all hyped to get this and the rose one cause I thought it would be phenomenal and I’m sooooo disappointed. Just buy a regular lip balm and save yourself 23 dollars.,0.0

"I was really excited to try this out based off a recommendation from my friend, but I cant say i was impressed. The cream really doesnt absorb into my skin, i smear it around and then it gives me a greasy look while just sitting on my skin. And I also think the fragrance (rose) irritated my skin. Overall not worth the price, I find my Cetaphil moisturizer gives me better results.",0.0
"The toner itself is so-so. It does make my face feel soft, which is nice, but it doesn’t do much more than that. The reason for me writing this review is the packaging. The product is slightly thicker than a typical liquid toner, which is fine. However, when you try to dispense this onto a cotton round I have found it incredibly difficult to get an amount that is anything but excessive. With any other liquid toner I would tilt the bottle upside down and let it saturate the cotton round. Since this product is a little thicker, that does not work. You must pour it onto a round which then results in a wastefully large amount of product coming out all at once. I wish there was a pump dispenser or a smaller hole at the top of the bottle.",0.0
"I like this moisturizer but it’s just a basic moisturizer. As one reviewer pointed out, the ’vitamins’ are pretty much BS considering the packaging. It’s not all that great of a moisturizer so I actually use this as more of a makeup priming moisturizer. It does have a nice smell and it soaks into the skin immediately. I’m not going to be rebuying this, I don’t need it in my skincare routine so it’s not worth the price tag.",0.0

"After hearing such great things about this skincare line, I was so excited to try it when I got a sample size of it for free in my VoxBox from influenster! However, I was pretty let down. I did notice my skin was slightly brighter whenever I used this, but I feel like the lasting effects weren’t drastic or worth it enough (in my opinion) to continue purchasing. It honestly kind of felt like I was putting water on my face sometimes. The fragrance is pretty light but to me, it still had a weird scent to it that I wasn’t a fan of and always held my breath when applying it. I first applied this using a cotton pad when I got it initially. However, I felt like the cotton pad soaked up so Much of the product and not enough was going on my face. So I tried just directly splashing a few drops of the essence into palm of my hands before directly patting it into my face. Even then, I felt like the essence absorbed so quickly into my hands and not my face so I felt like I was still missing out in this product. Overall, I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing this product more because the price and the lack of results from using this product.",0.0

Super hydrating but it is a little thick for my taste.,1.0
I was really scared to buy this due to a lot of negative reviews from people with oily skin saying they break out (everything makes me breakout) I have tried so many moisturizers and for some reason they all clog my pores.

Good. Not great. It does remove makeup and impurities. I’m not a huge fan of the squeeze bottle. I just prefer a pump. The smell isn’t the greatest. I feel like it smells a little chemically? I do like that it removes all of the makeup on my face but it does leave behind anything waterproof you may wear. The size of the packaging is also good for the price point. Only a little is needed.,0.0

"I have been using this moisturizer for years. I had extremely oily skin in my teens and 20’s, and this was my go to moisturizer. I even bought the huge limited edition jar. Influenster recently sent me a mini aqua bomb in a voxbox, and it just brought me right back to when I first discovered this lovely plumping juicy moisturizer. This is so lightweight, and makes your skin feel absolutely amazing. The smell is lovely too. I like to pair this with the aqua eye bomb and the aqua bomb sleeping mask. This will NOT break you out either if you have sensitive skin! I highly recommend this moisturizer to anyone with any skin type to be honest. I received my little jar for free in exchange for my review.",1.0
I was very surprised to learn that this was a powder. I mixed it with water and it was like magic. It was super gentle on my face but I could tell it was dowsing something. It says daily but I’m using a few times a week just because I have very sensitive skin but I love this stuff. Also this was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling,1.0

Kind of a white cast when applied. Makes my skin feel sweaty for 15 minutes and then i dont feel it after that. Wish it didnt make me feel greasy while i wait for it to set in.,0.0
Works really well for exfoliation. I don’t use this daily but rather every two to three days. I’ve used it a few times now and feel like it has lightened my skin up and also took care of my dry spots. It feels good and I suggest not to put too much pressure when rubbing this product into your face. Just use light pressure. The little beads get the job done that way and won’t damage the skin. Great product!,1.0

Amazing!! I have extremely dry skin all year round and this face cream moisturizes like no other and leaves my skin so plump and hydrated the next morning.,1.0
"Not for me.  I think this has too much HA in it for me.  I know it’s a cult favorite, so maybe it will work for you, but it has a lot of HA, so you’re going to want to not use it on drier days or in dry climates.  I end up having to put another moisturizer on top of this when when I use it.  The texture’s cool, similar to Tatcha’s water cream.  I prefer the water cream to this one.  Again, my big issue is the high HA content.  Sounded like a good idea on paper, but not so much in practice.  Dries my skin out.",0.0

"There is no doubt that this is a good product. My only issue with it is that when I first started using it it caused my skin to break out. This lasted through 3 days of using and after that amount of time the break out cleared and left my with glowing skin. This has happened with other products before BUT with others there is usually burning in addition to the acne. With this it did not happen. Besides that this is pretty much the perfect moisturizer. The smell is AMAZING, the texture is so SMOOTH and my skin looks  FLAWLESS (in 3-5 business days)HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR NORMAL - OILY SKIN TYPES",1.0
I received a sample sachet size of this product in exchange for a review with my honest opinion. The main things I like about this product and Clinique in general is the lack of fragrance - I never worry about having an adverse reaction to my skin. I used the eye cream in conjunction with the wrinkle cream from the same line but the 1ml sample was not enough to make me curious to buy. I think there are similar eye creams available; but Clinique is a good bet for those with sensitive skin. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct,0.0

"I received a free sample packet of this cream and was very excited to try it. I have combination skin and liked the way this applied. After application, I immediately smelled the scent of chemical sunscreen, and my skin became itchy. This surprised me, since I saw nothing indicating this product has an SPF on the front label or description. After reviewing the ingredient list, I see it contains Octocrylene, which is a chemical sunscreen that I can’t wear without irritation and break outs. I quickly cleaned my face and am hoping the irritation is limited to the itchiness I felt after applying it, since I had the cream on for less than 15 minutes. It is extremely disappointing, that this ingredient is included when there is no indication that the product has SPF on the front label or description. I always check the ingredient list when SPF is indicated, because I know this ingredient irritates my skin. I learned a valuable lesson about checking for sunscreens, even in products where no SPF is indicated! 2 stars for that.",0.0

I have given this product 2 stars just for the fact that it didn’t really do anything. I really love Fresh products but I just feel that this falls short compared to the other masks such a Umbrian clay which is my favorite. It smells lovely but that’s about it.

My skin was taking a beating like never before, I started noticing a lot of dry patches and my usual moisturizers weren’t keeping me hydrated. Never have I wanted oily skin so badly! My makeup looked horrible since I always wear matte foundations because of my oils they looked terrible on my skin. I got beyond desperate and started looking for a new moisturizer that would save my skins life. I came across this Kiehl’s one and after doing extensive research decided to purchase. Omg best purchase I have made thus far! This thing has saved my life literally, I don’t have dry patches anymore I can finally wear my matte foundations like always and my skin feels rejuvenated and smooth. I am beyond impressed! I purchase the smaller size just in case it wouldn’t work but will be buying the bigger one once this one is done. I have been using it under my makeup and even though it is a bit thicker than what I’m used to it looks great makeup last all day! Love this so much!!!",1.0

It also softened my skin’s texture and improved its overall tone, eliminating the redness and pinker tones that usually take over. It’s gentle while still being powerful enough to get the job done! I love the mix of ingredients - pore-minimizing willow bark, refreshing organic cucumber, glow-boosting azelaic acid and exfoliating sugar beet. Who wouldn’t want to drench their skin in that?! Everyone needs a good toner, and this is the perfect addition to any skincare routine. The scent is refreshing and uplifting, while the HUGE SIZE makes this last quite a long time - total bonus!",1.0
they are not the same anymore. not as soft and i get those breakage cotton left behind. i dont know if its a bad batch or something. i believe they changed it because everything is going up.,0.0
"Meh, was moisturizing but nothing special, especially for the money. Lips still dry and cracked in the winter, not 20 minutes later.",0.0
I received the Greek Yoghurt Foaming Cream Cleanser as a complimentary gift in exchange for a review. I love that is is a cream to foam cleanser it makes my skin feel so dewy since my skin is normally extremely dry. After using the cleanser my skin feel so clean and moisturizer. Definitely recommend if you have dry skin!,1.0
"I used this for a few days, and I started breaking out with little bumps on my chin and cheeks. Waited a few weeks, then started using it again.  After a few days I started breaking out and those bumps came back.  I do not have sensitive skin, and I’m not prone to breakouts.",0.0
"Could I have received a bad one? I honestly really didn’t like this product at all. It smells like spoiled oil, it leaves a grease layer on my skin when I try to wash it off, and it did a worse job removing mascara than my inexpensive just normal cleanser! I love a couple other makeup remover balm- type products from other companies and I honestly don’t even want to finish this jar, it’s that terrible for me. Maybe I just got a dud?",0.0
Took a break from my normal r f which always leave my skin dewy. Nothing else has been comparable until now. Super hydrating amd smooth.  Suprising for winter skin.  Impressed with how it feels and happy with the quality of ingredients going on my face. ♡,1.0
"This sunscreen is awesome!! I was scared that with that texture it would feel like a Benefit Porefessional and be very drying, but it’s a lovely velvet texture. It doesn’t feel drying at all, but does take a little bit of shine off your face for a nice skin texture. My skin feels great when I use this!!",1.0
This is a good product. It absorbs really quickly into my skin. I knocked off a couple stars because it left a thin film on my skin. I only got a weeks worth of product and didn’t really notice a difference in the short amount of time. I liked the packaging and that there wasn’t a strong fragrance. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate it at all which was good. I wouldn’t recommend this product but maybe you just need to use it longer than I did!,0.0
Greatly enjoyed this product when I first bought it. Started to notice my makeup breaking up during the day so I started using less oil on my skin and I noticed the skin on my nose was extremely dry and dehydrated. Taming a break from it right now but might need to return it. I have oily skin so dry skin is rare.,0.0
Really wanted to love this stuff because of how clean it is. But it pills terribly. Alone or layered. Disappointing.,0.0
"As a big fan of JM’s products who has been using this product for the last 10 years, I have to agree With the previous reviewer. The last 2 bottles of this oil that I have purchased have had a terrible smell. What’s going on with the production???",1.0
Used my samples for two nights and got several breakouts on my face and all over my neck which never happens. I know it’s from this cause I put it on my neck too. I have combo skin and usually stuff doesn’t break me out.,0.0
"This is a super hydrating moisturizer - it is on the heavier side, which I enjoy in my winter PM routine so this was a welcomed experience! This cream makes my skin so soooooo SOFT! It does give skin a shimmery sheen and my skin did feel plumper, but it’s hard to speak to the true efficacy when it comes to firmness since this was such a teensy sample. I would need more time with the product to be able to truly comment on that aspect.",1.0
"I was SO excited to get this after reading the reviews, but it didn’t last. It’s super thick going on, like most Zinc sunscreens, but then it just sat there. Instead of fading to a nice beige it kind of changed from pale green to pale white. I am a very fair person and I still looked like I had anemia. To add insult to injury I got a big spattering of whiteheads after using it. I LOVE the black Dr. Jart BB cream so I had big hopes for this one, but it now has the distinction of being the very first product I’ve ever returned at Sephora (and I’ve been shopping here a loooong long time.)",0.0
I absolutely love this facial scrub I received this product as a complimentary free product from influenster it smells amazing and made my face feel really smooth also I have notice a big change in my acne I absolutely love this product thank you so much for this opportunity to try this product!,1.0
The best 2 in 1 “Hybrid” product. Thank you to influensterca for this complimentary products. It’s a very light and creamy. When you put the product on  expect it to feel wet (like a toner) and once it dries you’re skin is left with moisturized glowing skin! The nozzle is small and with the cap it prevents leakage. Apply the product in your hands than Pat in your skin,1.0
"I was influenced! Saw someone using this on instagram + really hyped it up and I got excited, finally bought it. I wouldn’t say my lips are usually chapped – I use a chapstick with Vitamin E so that takes care of it; I just wanted extra soft and plump lips! First – This was a little sticky so might get on your pillow if you’re a side/stomach sleeper. Second – my lips felt more chapped in the morning after putting this on. I felt like I had to immediately put chapstick on. It just didn’t feel like it did what it advertised. Third – My lips did seem plumper + there’s a lot of product so it’ll last a long time, so gave it a few stars. Wouldn’t buy for myself again though.",0.0
i love this!! i have sensitive skin and the weather has made it so dry but this works amazing!,1.0
This product works great. Left my skin feeling soft and supple. I would recommend to friends and family,1.0
No color. No smell. No residue. BEST SUNSCREEN EVER!,1.0
I was really excited to try this till I got it in the mail- super disappointed! Not worth the $$ for the amount of product and the consistency & texture of the product was not great- felt as though it wasn’t doing anything for my skin- way better product for scrubs out there!,0.0
I received a First AId Beauty cleanser in a subscription box previously. I love the cleanser as it does not dry my skin out and makes my face feel fresh!,1.0
I am very happy I purchased this fan favorite. Great hydration and I have noticed an improvement in my skin.,1.0
"I received this for free in exchange for an honest review. This is oil free, but goes on really greasy. I like that it has hyaluronic acid, and that it’s spf 42. It has a tint, but goes on very white, to the point that it left white residue on my work hat, and I could see it coming off when I washed my face. Overall, I’m not sure if I would get this again, I love the high spf and hyaluronic acid, but I’m not sure that my skin is even absorbing the hyaluronic acid since I’m wearing over serums and moisturizers, and I can always use a hyaluronic acid serum separately. I didn’t love the greasiness or that it made me look so white, and I mean literally white, not pale.",0.0
So I got a sample of this with my order and I was really thinking how bad can this smell. Like it can’t possibly outweight the benefits. Honestly I wouldn’t recommend this product. There are so many other well formulated products that no scent. I don’t see why they released this,0.0
They really should stress on the directions that this is a cleansing balm that requires you to follow up with an actual cleanser. This works nice as the first step in a double cleanse routine but it’s not a stand alone cleanser IMO. It leaves your face feeling oily and leaves behind a residue.,0.0
"Like a fool I just confidently bought the largest size of this because I had seen so many people like it and my beloved Krave beet shield turned out to be a lie so I had to find a sunscreen fast. I’m not one for returns so I will finish this bottle but I won’t be purchasing again. I like my sunscreen to feel weightless and sink into my skin, this one has a strange silicone texture that sits on my face for a long time before any of it sinks in. That is not all of it sinks in anyways. It rubs off easily no matter what I do, and it’s not an invisible feeling at all. I gave it two stars because it is completely “unseen” since it comes out and goes on clear so if you don’t mind a silicone texture and it never sinking in then you’ll probably like this product.",0.0
"I was nervous to try this as I have VERY senstive skin. However, I have had no negative reaction at all!!! It smells wonderful, and you get quite a bit of product. The reason I only gave 3 stars is because I don’t feel it did anything special. My skin wasn’t that much brighter or softer after use. It was pretty average. So overall its a decent exfoliator but nothing I’ll be running to the store for as other products work much better for me.",0.0
"The first two times I used this product, I liked it. I didn’t think it was better than other cleansers I’ve used before but it didn’t do an overall bad job. The third time I used this product however my face was extremely red afterward. I would say the strawberries had something to do with it. My face had an obvious line on my chin of where the redness had  stopped. It slowly faded away of the course of two days. I would say this product is good for people who DO NOT have sensitive skin.",0.0
"I love this stuff! Got a sample in my Play! box, and ordered the full size. I’m struggling with dryness this winter, and flaking - so for me, this is more of a spring/summer moisturizer. It sinks right into my skin, and there’s hardly a smell. LOVE it!",1.0
"Do not recommend, gave me a chemical burn/reaction. around my nose and mouth and patches on my cheeks. And gave me a terrible breakout.",0.0
"Ok, so don’t freak out when it looks like the white smear won’t rub in just trust it and don’t use too much. This is a heavier cream and makes your skin soooo soft. Definitely use before bed.",1.0
It is nice and all but it just does not leave my skin feeling clean. I was kind of disappointed.,0.0
"Drunk Elephant I’m sorry but this lip balm didn’t work for my lips.Using for the third time didn’t change my reactions to this product,unfortunately my lips were not moisture the balm even make them drier and rough than normal.Also the the bottle could get upgrades because it’s very hard at the end get it out.",0.0
The Olehenriksen Dewtopia is a mini facial in a bottle. I love this serum. I use this three times a week. My dark areas are looking lighter and is blended better to my skin. I believe the dark area will disappear . My skin is softer.  It’s a must have to your Beautiful skin routine. This brand Olehenriksen does so many facial products correct. I’m so very thankful that I received a full sized bottle of Dewtopia for free for being an influencer. I have never tried anything that has acid as an ingredient. There was no burning or tingling for me. Just noticeable results. I love this Dewtopia and will make it apart of my routine.,1.0
"It’s a lovely texture and soaks in nicely, but I have sensitive skin and I find it burns a little when I put it on and will get irritation after use. Probably just allergic to an ingredient, but if you have sensitive skin I suggest choosing a different product.",0.0
My skin instantly looked refreshed and dewy after just one use. I didn’t notice a firming effect as it says the cream does but I am hoping with prolonged use that that will eventually happen. The only downside to this cream is the $89 price tag. I really loved this sample but don’t know if I can justify spending $89 on it. If you don’t mind that price tag then I would highly recommend this cream. I certainly immediately noticed is a change in texture and hydration. My skin absorbs this easily without any greasy or cakey feeling. It immediately feels velvety smooth and hydrated. Overall a great night cream.,1.0
This serum is amazing! I love how the texture is not too thick and the scent is not too strong. My skin looks and feels so refreshed after using this. My skin is also so hydrated and smooth after putting this on. I highly recommend! It’s prefect for my skin.,1.0
I recently received a free sample of this from Pinchme. I LOVED how soft and smooth it made my skin feel and didnt dry it out. I would definitely buy more of this.,1.0
"After 3 months, I have seen absolutely no improvements - rather I feel like this did the complete opposite and caused my skin to look dry, dull, flaky, red and distressed. It also caused me to break out. Not new to retinol - so I understand it takes some time to get your skin acclimated to a new product and go through a “purging” period with retinol .. I used it once a week at first, then twice a week at most, and even paired it with DE’s B-Hydra serum to mitigate potential drying side effects, and also used their Protini Cream, but after 3 months of using Passioni I’m so done with this. My skin barrier has been destroyed for 3 months, my face feels and looks like a hot mess. I would not recommend Passioni at all, especially at this price point. Going to search for a less potent retinol.",0.0
"I loved this product! Instant hydration and it didn’t break me out even though it’s a rich cream ( I have problems with cystic acne). It gives your skin a nice glow and improves skin texture over time. Also, it smells great, subtle rose scent!",1.0

"Absolutely gorgeous serum! Absorbs almost instantly and is super lightweight. Hydrating, but not oily whatsoever. My skin feels like silk and after about a week it’s starting to look really good. Better than it has in years! So happy to have received this and I am looking forward to continuing improvement! 100% recommended. #trywithtopbox #gotitfree",1.0
"Looks really cute on my countertop, smells nice, and works great! I recommend using 1 pump at a time and just spreading it carefully, since the bottle isn’t that big, but my skin does feel noticeable softer and smoother. I use it in the morning and at night, after cleansing with a facial brush.",1.0
"It does the job. It came as a sample in a gift from my boyfriend, and while it does moisturize and nourish the skin, I’ve used better moisturizers at better price points. It is very rich, so it may be worth it to someone with very dry skin and aging concerns, but at least for me, there are better options available.",0.0
I started using this when I developed eczema around my eyes - it’s very soothing and provides intense hydration. It’s a great product if you’re prone to dryness around your eyes.,1.0
"I have pretty bad hormonal acne, and after reading the reviews I thought this would really help to clear my skin up. Not only did it make my skin red and irritated, but I broke out so badly. I thought maybe it was just me, so I gave it to my boyfriend and he said it broke him out too. I’m so mad that I spent $90 on this. Drunk Elephant is NOT for sensitive skin!",0.0
"I was thrilled to try Goop Glow Overnight Glow Peel  complimentary from Goop in exchange for my honest opinion.  I am a middle aged woman and I’m always looking for products to help with  the issues of aging skin.   This product was wonderful! This peel exfoliates and brightens the skin, without leaving it dry and damaged.  It leaves the skin looking bright,fresh looking,and smooth.  This peel contains glycolic acid,fruit extracts, and hyaluronic acid.   After one use skin looked more refreshed - like I’d had a good nights sleep",1.0
"I received this #freeproduct in sample size from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review.  I did notice slight difference in my fine lines for the 2 weeks I used it.  I only used it at night and I have no deep wrinkles, only fine lines around the eyes and mouth.  The product absorbed into the skin nicely and leaves the skin feeling moisturized and soft, which I really liked.  I would love to see what prolonged use of this product can do for my fine lines.  Overall, based on my sample product, I have high hopes.",1.0

Have been using for a week or so now and already there is a noticeable difference. My lips feel softer and a little bit goes a long way. I see this product lasting for a long time and it was well worth it. The applicator it comes with is like a silicone so it won’t get old and gross and allows for an easily apply right before bed.,1.0
"I didn’t have very high hopes for this sunscreen when I first tried it out. Seeing how high the SPF was, I assumed it would be thick and oily, but I was actually wrong! This sunscreen is very light yet effective, and it’s tinted slightly beige, not at all white, so it doesn’t leave that obvious pale white sunscreen look after it’s applied. It also has a very light and nice smelling scent too it that I adore. And on top of all that, it works great with makeup! Highly recommend!",1.0
"I’ve tried using this twice, I could not get over the smell. It smells terrible, almost like a mix of mouthwash+peppermint+essential oils. Too much fragrance for me, no thanks. Also, my nose was still extremely oily after using it.",0.0

This better never ever get discontinued!  It does not feel heavy or overly wet at all! Amazing and it smells good!,1.0

I love this but wish it’s not so expensive. I noticed some changes to my skin after using it for 4 months. I put it on twice a week at night. My skin appears to be healthy and glowly. I had some breakout at the beginning but my skin gotten use to it by now. I took out one star is because it’s too pricy.,0.0

"I was pleasantly surprised with this product! I have never used a color corrector before so I was excited to receive a complimentary sample from Influenster. I used it after my moisturizer and before my foundation and it blended my skin into a matching shade. The consistency was a little thicker than I imagined, it was similar to my concealer but honestly did a better job. Will be purchasing in the future! Very happy.",1.0

Loving this enzyme scrub. Added a dot of the enzyme scrub onto my hand and gently rubbed my skin. It feels like dirt is forming on my skin but it’s not dirt. It left my skin feeling super soft and left a nice refreshed glow. Love this face glow but you really need to be gentle rubbing your face or it can feel rough.,1.0

"In reading other reviews, it appears a lot of people like this product. I really wanted to like it. However, after using once, I got the biggest pimple I’ve ever had on my forehead. Coincidence? No clue. But I’m guessing my skin was a little too sensitive for the salycic acid. To be clear, I use Neutrogena on a daily, so I’m not 100% sure that’s the issue. This is a lightweight cream that you don’t notice after applying and it’s unscented. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.",0.0
This mask feels like it pulls all the junk from your skin. It makes my skin feel really clean after i use it. The 1st week i got it i used it twice and i did got a pimple the next day. I just think it pulled everything out from underneath.,1.0
I tried it once and my face felt very clean afterwards. There was no tingling or stinging that was mentioned as a possible effect in the instructions. I ended up returning the item because the smell is so strong and it is not pleasant.,0.0
Really made my skin look healthy and dewy. Made my skin almost shine and look fresh. The only downside would be the slight tackiness it gives but it does help to apply makeup over it!,1.0

"For me, this moisturizer was just meh. I have very dry patches on my skin and I find that this didn’t do anything to help my skin feel more moisturized. it does have a lovely consistency, and it feels great when you put it on. but it unfortunately didn’t do anything for my skin. I wouldn’t repurchase.",0.0
I used this vitamin C serum and I think the next day I broke out because of it. Perhaps it’s a little too strong for my skin or perhaps it’s the fragrance. Maybe will work better for me in the summer when my skin is less sensitive. This was gifted to me by Sunday Riley.,0.0

I rarely find products I think are worthy of a five star rating but this one takes the cake! The first time I used this was on a very congested area of my chin and it literally sucked everything out without irritating my skin! I do recommend possibly using an extraction tool to remove any excess congestion (trust me this will bring everything to a head-seriously!) but these work really well. Very impressive,1.0
"I really like this product, it’s great for evening out my skin and it’s very lightweight. It does however look not great if I have any dry skin and it also needs primer and some setting spray or else it can transfer easily",1.0
"I only use balms now- started out with Sunday Riley and switched to Estée Lauder. This one attracted me because it was cheaper and smelled wonderful. It seemed to work wonderful too- until I tried to remove my eye makeup with it. My eyes teared up like crazy and were very red for about half the day. Tried it again the next day just to make sure it wasn’t something else but it happened again. Maybe my eyes are too sensitive, but I went back to the Estée Lauder balm and returned this one. :(",0.0

"I like this moisturizer for night time, it doesn’t seem to agree with all foundations so that’s really just a personally hit and miss. I love the smell, definitely gives me that wake up feeling. I don’t think this is as moisturizing as it says, after a few hours my skin is already feeling dried out. I also feel like this leaves a little film on the skin instead of sinking right in. It’s a good product depending on what you’re looking for, better ones on the market and for how little you get I just don’t think this ones worth the money.",0.0
I was so excited when i purchased this. I have acne prone skin so I have acne scars of course and this is supposed to help but instead it made my face erupt in huge cystic pimples. So if you also have acne prone skin beware when purchasing,0.0
My mother was looking for a good anti-aging moisturizer so I gifted this to her. The fragrance was very light and floral. The cream is super moisturizing and gives the skin a beautiful glow.

I love glow receipt and I absolutely love their watermelon scented products. I honestly am loving this toner. It’s hydrating and feels so good on the skin. It almost acts like an essence as it soaks in all my serums and moisturizers after. It’s not tacky but it has that consistently. It’s gel like almost which I think is new in a toner. It’s not just liquidy.,1.0

"Love this Moisturizer! It’s Rich, Moisturizing, and soothing. I have combo (leaning more dry) skin, we are coming into spring, and I just bumped up my retinol. All that could quickly turn into a disaster because it’s getting warmer, I’m getting oilier, and I’m making my skin work. Breakout city is just around the corner! But, BUT, everything has been smooth sailing so far and I think it is partially due to me switching to this moisturizer. I used Farmacy Honey Halo all winter and loved it!! But with spring coming, I wanted a less rich moisturizer without compromising on the benefits. This was the perfect choice for me. I’ll say it again, For Me. Idk how anyone else will react to this but I love it. It’s slightly thick, a little rich, and really moisturizing. But not greasy. My skin didn’t even phase the bump up in percentage of my retinol and I’m waking up even more glowing than usual (most likely due to the retinol but partially because this moisturizer works so well for me!) 10/10 - would recommend. Chefs Kiss.",1.0
Got this to complementary to Tess and try. After a week I noticed some dry flakey patches needs my nose. A little bit does go a long way. There’s a faint smell but nothing over powering! Wasn’t overly impressed but wasn’t upset with the product either. My over all thought is it’s average & I personally wouldn’t purchase because there’s other products for night serum on the market that are far better.,0.0

"This is probably a fantastic eye cream for someone with really dry skin - but dry skin isn’t an issue I have. It’s a decent eye cream regardless, don’t get me wrong. But I’ve tried better eye creams that cost less. I do like that the consistency isn’t too heavy. I also appreciate that it isn’t heavily scented and that’s it’s kind of a gel-cream instead of a straight up heavy cream. I just haven’t seen any noticeable difference since I started using it. It’s better than 3 stars, but not quite 4. More like a 3.5, but that’s not an option on Sephora’s rating system.",0.0
"Not for dry skin Patches onto texture not natural lookingConsistency is thick, hard to wash off Not moisturizing at all Appears like foundation or bb cream on skin as matte finishNot a huge difference on redness probably same result as bb cream or probably better off with bb cream since it won’t look white on dry patchesI’m sure for those who don’t have dry skin or rough texture and are probably super white it will appear great on",0.0

"I bought a deluxe sample size if this is a Farmacy mini set with the serum (that I love) and the honey mask I really like. At the time I was really struggling to find an effective and gentle facial cleanser. I was using a deluxe sample that I got of the youth to the people probiotic cleanser for 2 weeks and it made my face too dry. I was also using the Pacifica sea foam cleanser and that also made my face dry. It was terrible!! I was used to using the Cera Ve hydration cleanser for a year and even after switching to the organic cleansers for a few months, my skin just couldn’t stop feeling dry!! A cleansing balm sounded super gentle and I have actually never tried a cleansing balm before. I don’t wear makeup often at all and if I do it is organic. So I was planning on using it to only remove makeup but I was desperate for a cleanser! This is SO GENTLE and effective!!! Honestly, I could actually feel it removing blackheads! I’ve never felt a cleanser or scrub remove blackheads without stripping my skin of moisture!!!! It isn’t greasy or foamy. It’s literally like rubbing lip balm on your skin!! I love it so much and I am going to buy a full size since it is also organic and cruelty free!!!!",1.0
"This is a decent eye cream at a great price. While I didn’t see a reduction in dark circles, I can see a small reduction in fine lines. It wears well under makeup, which is important to me. Overall, I would recommend if you want a simple, effective, affordable eye cream.",1.0

"Gives an initial juicy gloss and shine which makes your lips feel plump.  After using it nightly for two weeks my lips feel so dry they burn.  My mistake not looking at the ingredients,  synthetic wax’s/emollients arnt going to make your lips moisturized.  You will be better off buying a cocoa butter based lip balm for $3.",0.0
this moisturizer is amazing. The formula is so smooth and creamy and has made such a difference in improving the dryness of my skin. It feels great on the skin — doesn’t feel thick or cause my skin to look oily/greasy. I love using it before I apply my makeup because it makes my foundation go on beautifully smooth. Loving this product.,1.0
I’m so thankful that I discovered this product. I developed sebaceous hyperplasia on my forehead. I’ve had in-office treatment ( electrocauterization ) done and they just come back. My dermatologist prescribed me Tret 0.05% and it did nothing. I recently purchased these pads and my forehead is clearing up. I think that the combo of Tret 0.05% and these pads is what finally did the trick. Thank freaking goodness!,1.0
"I did enjoy the Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. As I age, the area around my skin is drier than normal and this eye balm definitely delivers moisture. It is so moisturizing that by the end of the day I can still feel it on my skin. It is not a greasy balm and I did see that my dark circles were very slightly improving. This is a decent eye balm. I just can’t get past the price point. It is pricey.",1.0
"These pore strips are life changing. My target area has always been my nose, I’ve tried many different brands but none of them got the job done. I decided to give these a try, and my nose got fully cleared on my second time applying the strip. Yes, you have to wait 4-6 hours to see full results. Yes, they are a bit pricey.. but they are SO worth it.",1.0
I have never found an oil I liked because they always felt too heavy never really sunk in but wow this is my holy grail product. The fact that it is so light on the skin and does sink right it. I swear this product has made my skin look more radiant. I do have eczema and every now and then I get a flare up in certain places like my eyelid and it is so calming and does moisturizing for that flare up and it is amazing. I will recommend this product again and again,1.0
This product is phenomenal. I have very sensitive skin and breakout very easily but this product has significantly reduced the number of breakouts I get. It has improved the appearance of my pores and has even removed impurities around my nose that I never thought I’d be able to get rid of. The scent is signature Tatcha and smells amazing. I was also concerned that it was too expensive but I use the tiniest amount of cleanser that works for my entire face so I definitely think that you get your money’s worth out of it. Overall great product.,1.0
"I recently just ran out and I can confidently say i won’t be repurchasing this product. it’s not that it was awful, it just didn’t do anything for my skin. I have a few dry patches around on my skin that are especially noticeable when i wear makeup, applying this moisterizer in the morning and night didn’t really do enough. There are way better moisturizers you can purchase at the drugstore for 1/4 of this price, and that’s the tea.",0.0
I haven’t met a tatcha product that I don’t like yet. Of course you have to be skeptical when trying eye creams but for the first time when I put this on the next morning my skin looked radiant my make up applied smoother and I overall feel that my eyes are taken care of . I’ve been using it for over a week now and I love you a little goes a long way.  I received this product Complementary through Influenster but all opinions are my own,1.0

"I tried this product because I have sensitive skin. The pores onnmy Tzone are large, and my face blushes and breaks out in acne easily. The tube only lasted me about a month or a month and a half. The main reason whybI gave this product two stars is that the freaking paint that is printed on the the packaging always flakes off when I squeeze the tube... I would physically see paint chips on my finger tips and I can’t imagine that beinf good for your face at all.... I would have to put latex gloves on my hands and squeeze the cream on my wrist, then throw away the gloves and apply the cream with my fingers 2ce a day.. The cream kind of controlled the symptoms that I wanted, but I still had redness and beeakouts. Perhaps I would have gave it a better rating if I didn’t spend $48 to rub paint chips on my sensitive face",0.0
"I expected a lot more from this product based on reviews. It feels nice on application, but it is definitely not a very hydrating lip balm. My lips get pretty dry and when I use this overnight my lips are chapped in the morning. A fine protective balm but not very moisturizing and not worth the money.",0.0
"I absolutely hate wearing sunscreen. I’ve tried so many and every one makes my makeup peel and just looks and feels terrible. I love this one! It’s so light and smooth while providing great protection from the sun. I love that it acts as a primer as well, making my makeup look flawless. It couldn’t be better.",1.0
Its an okay product! Did the job of moisturizing for sure but not to the extent I wanted it .. I like a heavier moisturizer but only because my skin is always extremely dry. It also didn’t look appealing through the package  because I got it Influenster. Although it’ll do the job if you want a moisturizer,0.0
I definitely expected more out of this product effectiveness wise. Don’t get me wrong I think the product is very cute with the little applicator and everything but I think this is more of an aesthetic product. My lip medex is way more effective than this but I would recommend it if you want a cute aesthetic little lip balm!,0.0

"This is officially a product I will always have in my beauty arsenal! It quite literally plumps the skin for a beautiful texture and glow.

If you’re considering purchasing, do it!",1.0
"The best cleanser I’ve ever used!!  I start and never finish a lot of cleansers.  This one, I got a birthday sample and had to buy the full size!!

I think I love this brand!!",1.0

"I got this exfoliant as a free sample and as a woman who is extremely picky about the products she uses on her face I can say that I am beyond impressed. When I first noticed it was a powder I was curious because I’ve been looking for an exfoliant that isn’t too harsh where it feels like it’s cutting my face or too soft where it still feels dirty even after I wash it and I wasn’t sure where this would fall. It ended up being perfect for my skin. I’ve been having some small breakouts recently and since I’ve added this exfoliant to my process they’ve stopped and the only shine on my usually oily face is from my highlighter. I’m really happy with this product, my face looks and feels softer, and it’s done wonders for my skin!",1.0
"I loved this cream! It felt amazing on my skin. It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling silky smooth. I have felt a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin in just over a week. The only thing I dislike is the scent because it smells like Play-Doh. All in all, it’s a wonderful product that really made a difference in the hydration level and texture of my skin.",1.0
I feel my skin is much softer since using the Inkey Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum. It doesn’t have a strong odor and applies very easily over my face and neck.,1.0
I love this product! I brought a small one to try out and I’m in love that I went and bought the big bottle. A cleanser that doesn’t break me out. It doesn’t feel like it strip my skin. This a must have in your skin care.,1.0
Sunday Riley is my absolute favorite skincare and what I use on the daily! I was so excited to try this new eye serum out and I love it!,1.0

I don’t write many reviews but I had to for this. I hate this. I’ve tried to like it but it keeps making me break out so bad. :((,0.0
I used points to get a sample of this product and I’m glad I did because I wouldn’t spend my money on it. I have the facial cleanser that matches this and I absolutely love it. The moisturizer leaves me so greasy and shiny and it feels like it just sits on top of my skin. Instead of this product I recommend Farmacy Honey Halo.,0.0
"Incredible night time moisturizer that totally upgraded my skin. I’m a male 34 yo generally blessed with clear skin (thankfully) but this took my face to a whole other level. Extremely hydrating, face feels comfortable and repaired after waking up and feels velvety smooth as I wash. Too thick to use during the day imo but there isn’t anything better to use at night! I’ve tried a lot of them",1.0
"This cream smells amazing and is very creamy and hydrating. I just love it! Buuuuuut.... let’s do some math: .5oz is $29, 1oz is $64, and 1.7oz is $100. If you buy two .5oz creams, like I did, 1oz of this cream is only $58... $6 cheaper than the larger size for the same amount!! *Unfortunately with more waste*. Is this because you look “richer“ spending more money on the same amount because you have a bigger jar?? I have no idea who is crunching these numbers but the best deal is buying multiples of the .5oz bottles.",1.0
I am disappointed in this for so many reasons but the biggest one is that it contains alcohol. Why would you put an ingredient in your product that dries you out and makes redness worse?,0.0
"After using Dr. Dennis Gross Pore Perfecting and Refining Serum for over a week I could tell a difference in the reduction of my pores. It’s a nice lightweight and gentle serum. It feels natural on my skin and the fragrance is light. The dropper makes it easy to use and it blends easily. It took a few days to start to notice a change in my pores, but It did seem to brighten my skin after the first use.",1.0
"I started using this Oct2020, so it’s been 10 months of daily use. Since then, I’ve noticed my fine lines are gone (including my crows feet!), my old acne scars (from high school!) are less visible, sunspots are starting to fade (less brown in color), my overall face looks and feels smoother, and best part, my hormone triggered pimple (yes, one pimple, same spot every month just before the start of my menses) isn’t appearing anymore! These changes aren’t all in my head, my esthetician who I hadn’t seen since the start of the shutdown due to the pandemic, the first thing she said to me when I finally was able to visit her again, was to ask what I had been using on my face because the fine lines were all gone. I’m hoping after another year of use my sunspots would disappear entirely and my really deep wrinkles become less deep. In case you’re wondering, I’m mid-40’s with lots of fine lines (before using Violet-C)and some pretty deep wrinkles around my mouth and forehead. Definitely a product that works. Other great things about Violet-C:• great for sensitive skin - I have sensitive skin and can break out into a rash with certain products• not heavy on the face• serum not too watery• don’t need much, a little covers a lot of face area• absorbs quite quickly",1.0

"A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to test the lip sleeping mask from LaNeige. I have to admit that, at first, I was a bit skeptical. A mask for my lips, really? And guess what? I was wrong. This product is amazing! Really. It smells SO good, if you like strawberry smell, it’s for you! I bite my lips all the time during the day and with the constant change of weather, my lips can get really dry. I tried the mask on my lips, let it stay overnight and the next day, my lips were like so smooth and plumped !! Never would have thought of putting a cream on my lips but now that I know of that mask, I will definitely buy some more!",1.0
"Giving this 4 stars even though it’s not something I would purchase again. It’s a great cream and I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately I broke out around my chin area pretty quickly after starting to use it. I can still use it and avoid that area, but that’s not something I would want to keep doing long term. I’m still rating it 4 stars as this is really just a me problem and not the cream’s fault.",0.0

Been using this product for nearly 10 years. I have the oiliest t-zone in the world and the old formula used to be the only thing that would keep my t-zone matte for several days after using it. Since it’s been reformulated I notice no difference in my skin after using it. My skin remains super oily and none of my blemishes notice I had it on. You will also smell the sulfur in your pores for several days after using it. Please bring the old formula back!,0.0

Pros: leaves skin feeling soft and plump, lovely whipped texture that feels luxurious on the skin Cons: not for ultra dry skin, it smells artificial, I would prefer no fragrance at all, moisturizer feeling is short-lived.

"Only giving this bad boy a 4/5 because it really does dry out your skin. HOWEVER, it does work wonders on pipes and acne. So I would still definitely suggest adding this to any skincare routine! Make sure you use moisturizer or hyaluronic after and you’ll be just fine :)",1.0
"I have dry skin (Tret user) and this adds the perfect amount of hydration and brings back a healthy glow that my skin is now missing. I’m on my second bottle and I haven’t experienced any irritation or breakouts. It feels like a moisturizing lotion that just melts into he skin and becomes invisible. I’ve tried so many sunscreens (shiseido, tatcha, supergoop, Missha, Murad, and pretty much everything drugstore) and of those, only this and Missha spf’s leave your skin plump and juicy but not with a greasy finish at all. For $15 it’s such a steal, pick up a bottle ASAP. It’s one of the best sunscreens I’ve tried hands down",1.0

Thank you Topbox circle for sample. Unfortunately I cannot review whether the product works as the sample was merely enough to test for sensitivities. I’m future a larger size sample would be appropriate. All I can say is my skin tolerated it so no allergies to it.,0.0
"To start this off, I don’t think cleanser is a bad product. I just don’t think it should be a stand alone cleanser. After about a week of using this product I noticed a change in my skin’s texture. A week after that, it started to get oil, bumpy, and I experienced breakouts. With that being said, I continue to use this product to remove my makeup followed by a cleanser. Even then, I only use it when I’m wearing more makeup products than a on typical day. Thankfully my skin bounces back fairly quickly and after two to three weeks of discontinuing use my skin was back to normal. I do not recommend use as a cleanser, but as a makeup remover.",0.0
"It smells and feels amazing on my skin, but it doesn’t moisturize at all. It left my skin even more dry than before I started using this product.",0.0
I generally love this product. It does give deep and full hydration. It smells nice and it is absorbed almost directly. It has a matte finish after absorption. The only problem is that I can’t use this during the day when I do my makeup. I usually use a brush to put on the foundation. The cream scraps off when I brush through my face and leaves white residue on my face. It’s very disturbing. Just that. So I use this as the night cream and it’s doing great!,1.0

"This product DOES work and a very small amount goes a LONG way. I’m only giving it 3 stars because I have very sensitive skin and some of the ingredients aren’t great, and I worried they’d irritate my skin but I was hoping my skin wouldn’t notice. Well it did lol I’ve been using it for about 4-5 days and while my makeup and skin looked literally better than ever, my super clear skin has been having a decent amount of little tiny pimples since using this and it’s the only thing I’ve subbed in my routine. I’m so so so sad bc I seriously love this. If you don’t have sensitive skin, use it under your makeup! It marries your skincare and makeup so well, you can’t even tell you’re wearing makeup!

Will be trying a similar product at a more reasonable price but probably will break down and buy this one at some point to be honest. love it!,1.0
"It does unify skintone, reduces redness, reduces the need for make up.  Overall I recommend it. At least try the small size if you’re looking for a cure against redness!  but it’s not moisturizing enough for me. I have to use way too much to get the level of moisture needed.

This is my ultimate favourite moisturizer hands down. I love the scent and how you don’t need much product for the most plump radiant looking skin. The price is high but it’s one of the best so it’s worth it. You don’t need too much product and make sure you warm up the product with your fingers before patting it on your face.

"I deeply support the environmental reasons for using a glass bottle- however, then you really need a pump. The mini version’s complete lack of closure other than a cap not only makes it easy to waste product, but makes it dangerous. When holding and unscrewing the cap off the glass bottle in the slippery shower, mine slipped out of my hands and shattered into TONS of little glass pieces. Trying to get out of the shower with the cleanser and glass everywhere I cut my foot quite badly. bleeding all over my shower.  Good times. I can’t speak to the quality of the product as I only got to use it a couple times before it shattered. :-(",0.0

I received a free sample of bareMinerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum from PINCHme. I was impressed. It did not irritate my super sensitive skin. I loved how moisturizing it was and the way it made my skin plump up. I will definitely repurchase this product.,1.0

My skin has never been “nice”. I’ve always had quick oil producing skin with bumpy dry texture. Skin using this and not wearing makeup my skin is soft and smooth and beautiful. This is all I use and sometimes some other ordinary products.,1.0
Love farmacy brand but don’t like this product very much. Points for being clean but eyes feel gooey after using,0.0
"Consistency was very weird and chunky, almost like squeezing hardened coconut oil out of the tube. Each squirt was very solid, not lotion or moisturizer-like at all. My friend ordered a tube directly from the DCIEM site and the consistency was nice and smooth. Maybe I received an old product? No idea, but it takes a LOT of strength and effort to squeeze it out of the tube because of the strange consistency.",0.0

This was an Ok product however I did not find it as moisturizing as I would have liked. I have extremely dry skin so this did not exactly do what I needed. I used a lot and night and woke up feeling dry. I think for someone with oily skin this would be a better product.,1.0
need I say more... the packaging is good the dropper works very well but the smell is hard to dismiss.,0.0
"After using this twice, I had the worst break out of my entire life. My face was covered in whiteheads and so bumpy - it felt like I had a rash. The first time I used it, I thought I had a break out from wearing a new face mask due to quarantine but NOPE happened again the second time so guess this was the culprit! Bummer too because it had such great reviews. I don’t normally have sensitive skin so beware!!",0.0

I have finally found the holy grail face cream! I absolutely loved the the Kiehl’s face cream and have seen significant changes to my skin. This was my first time trying this brand. I have dry skin and this works great on my skin. I have been using this for more than 3 weeks. It’s lightweight and does not make my skin feel oily at all. I feel my skin complexion has gotten more clear and it has helped with dark spots. Ot leaves my skin feeling super hydrated for hours. I will definitely be purchasing this as soon as I run out of this. Needless to say this is my new favorite.,1.0
"I’m not sure how these ratings work: I see many 5-star reviews but as I’m writing this review I’m given a choice 1 through 4 stars. On a 5-star scale I would have given this balm 2, but with 4 being the maximum, it’s just 1.It’s the most unpleasant face washing product I’ve ever experienced. If to assume that the film it leaves on my face after I’m done is not harmful, probably it does its job, so I don’t want to bash it on that. But it is so unpleasant! In addition to the slimy feel after the wash, as some other reviewers have mentioned, it separates when I squeeze it out of the tube.I can’t believe so many people like it and rate that high. Clearly, we all find different things pleasing or displeasing. I’m sad that was the first Inkey product I’ve tried: now I’m reluctant to explore the brand further.",0.0
"Decided to try this product out after hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on it. I would say use this product with caution, I used it and at first it exfoliated and left my skin feeling smooth. However, after a few uses my skin began to breakout. I have never had breakouts on my cheek by nose and around my mouth. My pores were clogged and the more I used this product the more it got worse and now I can’t get rid of these blackheads and whiteheads and I never had this problem before.",0.0
I’ve tried this mask 3 times now and each time I’ve woken up the next day with breakouts. I have dry sensitive skin and thought this would be perfect for me based on reviews but it’s irritating for my sensitive skin. Unfortunately it’s past the return by date so I’m stuck with a whole tube.,0.0
"A classic! I’ve tried samples of this before and was happy to have a larger bottle to use. I use this on days where I am not using retinol and it instantly makes my skin feel smoother and clearer. It definitely has a slightly weird herbal smell but nothing too intense and it fades quickly. I really like how it makes my whole face feel softer and exfoliated without irritation. As far as fine lines, I haven’t noticed a drastic difference but do feel like overall texture is smoother (so wrinkles don’t seem as defined). Sunday Riley gifted me",1.0
"These are amazing, I use these daily to apply toner. I will definitely keep repurchasing.",1.0

"Reminds me of rose water toners except without the smell. It makes your skin feel fresh and clean ready to apply moisturizers. Light, cool and fresh.",1.0
"I love the brand but this is super overpriced lol. It’s pretty basic and you get more moisturizing with classic chapstick etc. Also not keen on the pot idea. I love the coconut scent so that’s the best part for me. Wouldn’t buy again, wanted to love but it’s only worth like $5-$10 in my opinion",0.0
Did not work for me. Yes it helps blur redness by going on green tint and blending to a beige. It almost made me look grey toned. It also felt very greasy and gritty. Comes off very easily even if you set with powder and setting spray.,0.0

"This oil is amazing.  I have dry acne prone skin.  My acne is caused by my skin getting too dry,  then my oil glands overcompensate.  All traditional acne products dry out your skin,  which just makes my acne worse. This oil moisturizes and fights acne at the same time.  My skin has never been as clear as it has been since I started using this.  Worth every penny.",1.0

"As a person who suffers from adult acne, I am constantly searching for the product that’s going to clear my face. Hellooooo, who doesn’t want a face smoother than a babies bottom (#goals) !?!? I’ve tried many different face masks, from name brand to drug store. When I heard about Ole Henriksen’s Cold Plunge Pore Mask I was extremely excited. Especially since I was sent the product free for testing purposes (who doesn’t love free things). Guys I’m going to be 100% honest, I’m a big fan of Ole Henriksen’s products but this mask was such let down. The mask has a mild minty sensation, and the cooling agent doesn’t kick in until AFTER your face is rinsed with cold water. I saw absolutely no difference pores size. However, the mask did control my oiliness for a few hours. My overall opinion - This is the perfect mask to wear during a girls night sleepover. The color is beautiful and would look great in selfies. Would I purchase in the future....umm no, especially not for $36.",0.0
"This started out well and I was soooo excited - it cleansed well without stripping my skin and seemed to be helping with hyperpigmentation, but after a couple weeks of use, this unfortunately started to irritate my dry/sensitive skin. I was hoping an oil cleanser would help with hydration but it ended up creating a few more dry and dark spots for me over time. I think this would be a great cleanser for a non-sensitive skin typeP.S. you definitely need to shake well before pumping out otherwise you’ll only get the thicker oils on the bottom and that’ll make it hard to massage onto your face",1.0
I love this cleanser. I use it everyday with no problems with my skin and my skin is super sensitive. I would recommend this product.,1.0
"I found this to be extremely hydrating and longlasting. It quickly absorbs into the skin and does not leave any residue. I have been looking for a good daily moisturizer for awhile. Unlike others, I feel like it really makes my skin look better too even after its washed off at night. I think rather than just sitting on top of the skin it is absorbed into the skin. It is also longlasting and does exactly what it says it will. Kiehls always makes amazing products. I highly recommend.",1.0

So i’ve had this for a while and barely used it over the summer. I was recommended this when I had a bad sunburn on my face and needed a very gentile cleanser for the time being and it worked wonders for that time. But the consistency of this cleanser isn’t something to use everyday if you have normal or oily skin. BUUUTTTT this is my holy grail when it gets cold out and my skin gets dry. I love using this as a mask and letting it sit for 10 mins. Softens up my dry cracking skin and really moisturizes my skin. It does leave a little residue on your face but It has never irritated my skin. I think it just locks in the moisture to keep skin soft after you rinse it off,1.0
"This is the best makeup remover I have ever used. I have used both Ole Henriksen Truth on the Glow Cleansing Wipes and Caudalie Make-Up Removing Cleansing Oil, but they shallow in comparison to this product! This is the only makeup remover I have found that ACTUALLY removes all makeup, including mascara that has been worn all day. Other makeup removers do not do this. When I use other makeup removers, I still find mascara under my eyes when I wash my face or leftover foundation when I use a toner and cotton round, but not with this product! This is a must-have for daily makeup wearers.",1.0

"I had heard so many good things about this so I decided to try it myself, I have combo/oily skin so I thought this would be perfect for me! Boy was I wrong. I really regret buying this cream. It is WAY overpriced for what you get. If you use the recommended pearl sized amount, it absorbs into the skin quickly, but... I’m left feeling dry again in 20 minutes. Defeats the purpose of using it as a moisturizer. So I need to use much more, which obviously isn’t economical as this cream is crazy expensive, I flew through it so quickly. It also has gold in it which (contrary to popular belief) has no effect on the skin other than possibly irritating it, which is exactly what it did to me. After I put this on, my skin would get quite red and irritated for a while, and I got a couple of breakouts on my forehead from this over the course of using it, which never happens to me. Overall, I didn’t hate it enough to not finish it, but I’d definitely never buy it again or recommend anyone else do so either.",0.0
"Sadly, I don’t feel like this serum did much for my skin. I’ve noticed no improvements after using this product for nearly 30 days.

I did receive this product for free for review purposes.",0.0

I really liked this product. I had visited the store to get the Eve Lom cleanser but they didn’t have it and this one was recommended so I tried it. It gets all my make up off and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I do use a warm wet cloth to remove the cleanser. In some instances I I have to use a bit extra for mascara and and eyeliner. I am going to give the Eve Lom another go to see if I prefer it. If there is no difference I will come back to this one as it is less expensive.,1.0

Not only is the price range great, but their skincare line is amazing.In particular, the Buffet serum is awesome. I know.. I have only been using this for more than 3 weeks, but I have already seen some changes to my skin! I can only imagine the long term use this will do to my skin. I use this  during the day after toner/essence and before my moisturizer. I pat this on my face with about a pea sized amount. The serum is watery based, and not too sticky. It is doing wonders for my hyperpigmentation and combo skin. Also a plus, my skin has evened out, as well as brightened. Definitely worth the try!",1.0
"I think this did an amazing job at moisturizing my face but it’s a bit overhyped in my opinion. There was nothing wowing about the products, it performed well but not amazing groundbreaking well so for that I wouldn’t repurchase this myself but maybe if you’re an older individual.",0.0

"I had high hopes for this face wash and really wanted to like it, I did. The packaging is adorable and it smells very good. It breaks down almost instantly on contact so it doesn’t do as much exfoliating as I would like.

It is not awful and I will use it, but will not be repurchasing.",0.0
"Honestly, not great. By chance if you’re here from skincare by Hyram then you’re probably as pumped about potentially purchasing this as I was. I have combo-dry skin and since it’s a gentle/light cleanser, I thought it would be good.

My favourite moisturizer. It absorbs nicely and my skin always feels soft. I have very sensitive skin and it has made it smother and improved the feel.,1.0
I absolutely love this stuff. I have it in berry and now in peach and they are both great. I originally didn’t care much for the scent of the berry but now I like it. The peach smells amazing! I love that you can wear this lip balm by itself or over your favorite lipstick for more color. It’s super hydrating and not sticky or tacky feeling. The only con for me is that it is a but pricey for the size.,1.0
"I’ve used this product for a few weeks now. It doesn’t absorb into the skin making it basically useless. I’ve notice no difference in dark circles, under eye bags, or fine lines. Not worth the price. I got a better result using the ordinary caffeine drops with create eye cream.",0.0
"So I don’t want to give this product a bad review because I have tons of friends that love it, but unfortunately it did not work out for me and wanted to make note of my experience for anyone that might be dealing with the same thing. I started having break outs and could not figure out why. Basically simplified my skin care routine to only using gentle cleansers and moisturizers and still the break outs remained. I have DRY skin and I also thought it was weird that by mid-day I would feel like a grease ball and felt like I needed to wash my face. Then I had the aha! Moment where the only thing I hadn’t tried to eliminate was this spf. Went a week without wearing this spf, no longer felt like a grease ball and the break outs started to clear up. Decided I can’t continue to not wear spf and after that week of not wearing this I went back and literally by the end of the day I became a pizza face again.

I really wanted to like this mask because i do follow Marianna on social media and i support women. but this didn’t do much for my acne prone skin. There was no plumping effect.

The marketing is amazing but it is not nearly as hydrating as it should be for the price and the small amount of product.

Love the consistency but doesn’t remove eye makeup. The canister comes with a tool to spoon a small amount but if you remove your makeup in the shower the balm tends to get wet and mildews.

Darker complexions BEWARE! I got this as a sample and I put this on my face with trust in my heart. It was like this pastel green thick substance. It was so thick calling it a cream is inaccurate.

Highly recommend.",1.0
"I’ve been using this product for about of month. At first at night because it is on the thicker side… however since the Valley heat has entered, I’ll try and do daytime too. Unfortunately it’s one of those you have to keep reapplying. I have to reapply every 2 hours. For its price tag, I was expecting more moisturizing. Won’t repurchase :(",0.0
Loved it! It made my skin really soft and hydrated.,1.0
This is just okay. I’ve tried other essences that are much cheaper that do a better job. It doesn’t moisturize my skin at all. I felt more texture after I started to use it. Won’t be repurchasing.,0.0
"I don’t recommend this product. I bought it because of the price, and hearing all the hype about AHA/BHA I wanted to give it a go. I give two stars because it’s very cheap and affordable. But otherwise it dried up and irritated my skin every time I used it and I tried for 6 weeks now - I think it’s safe to say it didn’t work for me. I don’t recommend.",0.0
I don’t really wear makeup but I LOVE cleansing balms over washes/gels etc because they feel like indulgent self-care.  I was initially very concerned that this one would be a bust after I used it two times with cold water and my face was left oily and unclean - and I had to cleanse with another product.  Turns out you’ve got to follow the directions on the packet... use warm water and this is a glorious one-step cleanser.  Loooove it and will be repurchasing as long as they continue to make it.,1.0
"I usually try to give products a chance before I fully write them off, but this gave me painful breakouts. The amount of silicone in this might be pore clogging even if you double cleanse like I do. You might be alright if you typically don’t suffer from acne. Also this makes my makeup slide off faster. The texture is also off putting.",0.0
"I prefer a more abrasive exfoliation, but overall my skin feels soft and clean after using this, and it smells nice, like other Tatcha products. I usually use this in the morning when my face is make-up free so I’m not sure how well this works to get make-up off. The only issue I’ve had so far was that the blue seal on the front popped off after the first time I squeezed the bottle. Overall, a nice cleanser.",1.0
"I received this product from Influenster and the brand in exchange for my honest review. I have normal to dry skin with large pores. I always look for products that can improve my skin texture. This serum claims to do that. After using the serum for 2 weeks, I find that it is a very lightweight and hydrating serum. It does feel sticky for first few seconds, but it absorbs very well to the skin. Even though I have seen a significant improvement in my pore size as well as my skin texture, I still recommend this serum if you are looking for a lightweight yet hydrating one.",1.0

Te first time I used these I though they hadn’t worked. I looked closer at it and realized the one on my chin had absorbed so much oil the whole sticker was the same color and thick with gunk! The nose ones you have to press a bit and there’s some spots on my face it just doesn’t pull from. All in all I love these things and use them once a week!,1.0
"I bought this because of all the positive reviews and have been very disappointed. First of all, let me say, if you knew me, I guarantee I’d be one of the palest people you know. I’m incredibly fair skinned and decided to take a walk on the wild side by buying the medium color tanning drops (as I usually buy the lightest color available due to my paleness). I have been using these drops daily and the effect has been minimal. Given that I am SO PALE and using medium color drops I expected more of a result. Honestly not worth the money to use these drops every day and barely notice a difference. Back to Tan Luxe I go!",0.0
Lips feel soft and rejuvenated after using this product. It is great quality!,1.0

"I got this as a beauty insider reward recently. I’ve used it a few times, and I do really like the consistency of it. It applies so smooth and sinks right into the skin. However, it just does not moisturize enough for me, and I have oily skin. I feel I could add an oil to it and it would work great, but I can’t justify spending almost $60 on a product that doesn’t take care of everything that it’s supposed to all on its own. Hasn’t irritated my skin at all. No funky smells or anything. Just leaves my face feeling a little tight.",0.0
"Used it 2 separate times, does not remove anything. Really really really disappointed as the wipes from this line are fantastic. I don’t prep with anything crazy, nor do I use waterproof makeup. Will not be buying again and upset I wasted my money.",0.0
I received a sample of this for an honest review. Its cleared up super dry spots on my skin on different areas of my body. I think you can use it on your face as well? From what I understand. But it makes my face way too oily and I already have super oily skin.,1.0
"I hemmed and hawed over this because it seemed a lot to spend on a fancy lip balm. And it is. But this is my favorite part of my evening routine because it’s so luscious, smells delicious, and works. My usual winter chapped lips are summer soft. Will have to get minis for friends and family now.",1.0
After watching iamsherkab on You Tube talk about this product I wanted to try it and I love it it smells really really good and my face feels clean and hydrated,1.0
I received this product from influencer for free to try! I like it but I don’t understand all the excitement over it. I still have to use other cleansers to tackle my maskne since I am an essential worker. It even almost causes more irritation with my face and mask when I just use the cleanser. I do like the grittyness though on my face but I really can’t tell a difference enough to say I love it.,0.0

While my skin definitely feels moisturized and smoother I did not notice anything as far as the fine lines on my forehead or neck which I hoped would become less noticeable. Otherwise the smell is amazing and it did not break my skin out at all. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are your own.",1.0
I wanted to really love this product.  I have tried to mix 1 drop to 4 drops with different lotions and cannot get an even look.  It looks orange and streaky. I am open to suggestions.  I like the smell but I cannot get it to work.,0.0
"I can’t understand what people like about this.  It was horrible as a lip balm, wore off quickly and left my lips feeling papery and dry.  I thought I could use it for dry, rough cuticles, but it was just ok for that.  And the smell is so weird, nothing like a rose.  I ended up throwing it away.",0.0
"I have very dry skin in the winter and I did not like this moisturizer at all. It was not hydrating for me and I often woke up with my skin feeling scaly and rough. I normally use just a hydrating oil and night and haven’t had this issue at all. I’ve tried Tarte Maracuja oil, Fresh Seaberry oil, and The Ordinary Rose Hip oil and none of them left me feeling dry the next day. I ended up having to mix this with a heavy moisturizer to get it to work for me. I gave it two stars because it wasn’t so bad that I wasn’t willing to finish the bottle since I already bought it, but I definitely wouldn’t repurchase or recommend to anyone with dry skin.",0.0
"I do think I saw a difference in fine lines (which is the only reason I gave more than one star), but a little bit of this goes a very long way, and even that is too much (even for an overnight cream). I have fairly dry skin and live in a climate that is cold most of the year, but this never dried and always stayed tacky (even the next morning). Luckily, it didn’t impact makeup application since I would wash my face again in the morning, but it was just very greasy and very heavy. I’ve switched to a different overnight cream, which addresses fine lines and wrinkles as well as hydration, but is not excessively heavy or greasy and am much happier. I still have some left, and will keep it as an emergency back-up since it’s not cheap, but I won’t be purchasing this product again.",0.0

"I was gifted the new Avocado Ceramide Recovery Serum from @glowrecipe.I’ve been using this beautiful serum for over a week and let me tell you...this baby has calmed the redness from my blemishes and helps with to reduce the redness in my cheeks. The smell of  Glow Recipe’s Avocado Ceramide Recovery Serum is light and fresh. Makes me think of a dewy spring morning after a light rain but if you are sensitive to smells you won’thave to worry about that smell lingering, it goes away once you apply it. I found the scent to be like an introduction to the beauty that the bottle holds inside. Like all of Glow Recipe’s products, the product texture it a light  non sticky formula that plays well with other products and I didnt feel any drying or any signs of issues while using. After a few days of using I noticed the redness of my blemishes subside and I really loved how it calmed my red cheeks. This serum is soothing and I love how the bottle fits perfect with my hand and the pump dispenses the right amount of serum. I really look forward to using this in my routine. #glowrecipe #avocado #gotitfree #skincare",1.0

I use this daily I think it has helped my pores but it’s a big step in my skin care routine. It’s got a lil stickiness to it which is awesome for your makeup to stick to when you apply it.

"I received a mini of this with a Water Cream set. Unfortunately I did not notice the ingredients contain acrylates copolymer, a plastic microbead. Microbeads have become part of our food chain and are present in fish and other sea life. Needless to say, they are a terrible idea and I deeply regret having purchased this. The best way to dispose of microbeads is to throw them away in a landfill so they don’t reach our water supply and oceans.",0.0

I just got this along with the purifying mask and the SOS thirst serum. I’ve been using it for a few days now and I absolutely love it. It doesn’t make my face feel dry after using it so I don’t have to double up on products. Highly recommend for stubborn acne.,1.0
"Four stars for how well it works, taking a star away for how needlessly expensive it is when there are effective competitors on the market. This will legit make your skin feel amazing. It’s no hoax. I got a sample size because I was ready to scoff at it, but it really did work. I noticed an immediate difference, especially when I ran out after buying a bottle of it. But let’s be real. It’s ungodly expensive... for a ferment liquid. This isn’t made of some super rare fermented flower that can only be found on a mountain top. It’s pitera, which is simply a type of yeast that found while fermenting rice. It’s not special, it works for sure, but does it cost as much as SK-II is trying to infer? Nope. Misha sells one, so does Cosrx, using the general “Galactomyces“ term for pitera. I’m currently using the Cosrx version, it’s a little thicker, but I’m getting the same effects. SK-II does really work, your skin will look, and feel better. I’m just saying, you can get the exact same product and effects elsewhere for much less. A pitera is an essential part of my skin routine now for sure. I’ll never stop using it. I can thank SK-II for that. However, I won’t be paying SK-II prices for it anymore.",0.0

Please save your money and don’t buy it.!,0.0

I am a huge lip product lover and have tried hundreds of lip balms and lip glosses. I’m also the kind of person who has so wear lip balm when going to sleep so that I wake up with soft lips. I tried this lip balm for a week every night and every morning I woke up to dry lips! I hated the gross berry scent and the formula just felt weird on my lips. There are so many better lip balms out there. I just don’t understand the raving reviews and the hype? Have people never even tried Vaseline before? This Laniege balm is the worst!,0.0

"As a sunscreen, it works. I’ve never had issues with sunburn while wearing Umbra. I like that it’s filled with antioxidants and I actually don’t mind the natural scent (it reminds me of oat milk).With that being said, it remains tacky most of the day, is hard to apply evenly, and leaves a noticeable grey cast. Personally, I don’t like the way it feels once applied on my skin. It’s similar to having heavy foundation on and I look forward to washing it off when I get home.",0.0
"It is moisturizing, but doesn’t compete with the sleeping mask. The applicator is really nice. I like when you don’t have to pull out a wand or use your finger to apply a lip balm. That being said, it is sticky upon application. The color is barely noticeable, so if you prefer another flavor, don’t get berry for the color alone. It’s not bad, but I don’t think I would repurchase this at the $15 price point.",0.0
"When I first tried the product, I only used it on the area of my skin where I had dark spots. In the beginning I did have some break outs there which causes blackheads.

"I tried this via the Sephora birthday gift. I’d followed Drunk Elephant for a while, really wanted to like them, but the person behind their social media accounts was so rude to people who experienced problems with their products that it turned me off of the whole brand... Anyway I figured I should give them a real chance and try this.I didn’t love the packaging. It’s a coarser, thicker plastic that reminded me of baby toys. The smell is also off-putting for me. I get that they want to be fragrance-free for the sake of sensitive skin, but it smells like straight soap, which doesn’t make me excited for my skincare routine.This stuff cleans my face, doesn’t sting my eyes, and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight, but other than that it isn’t anything special. My face does feel a bit dry after using it though, even in this humid summer weather, which is disappointing. It also made a complete mess of my makeup, and all I was wearing was a bit of under eye concealer, mascara (not even waterproof!), and liner. Instead of cleaning the makeup off my face, the cleanser just pushed it around and gave me raccoon eyes so bad that it took me just as long to clean that up with a makeup wipe as it had taken me to wash my face in the first place.tl;dr: If you want something that cleans a makeup-free face without completely drying you out, this is fine, but not worth the price. If you want something that can triple as a makeup remover and moisturizer, this isn’t it.",0.0
"This product is so weird, you need to “break the emulsion” I didn’t return it to give it a real chance because i love the kielh’s brand so much but it is just really hard to use because it gets slippery and hard to blend into your undereye skin, it is hydrating but I didn’t see mayor chances.",0.0

"I really enjoyed this product! It’s a great daily exfoliator because it isn’t harsh at all. I also feel that it is great for sensitive skin. It’s almost unscented there is no fragrance. The smell is a very faint smell of rice which is what it is made from. I’ve never had a powdered exfoliator before but I loved it! A little pea size amount goes a long way. I use this in the shower and just lather it together and apply it to my face. The formula is very nice and smooth. The only reason I marked it down a star is because it did dry out my face a little bit on one occasion so I just gave my face a break from it the next day and I was fine. I experienced a horrible breakout prior to receiving this due to stress and this definitely helped! I think the price is a little high for a product that is rice based but I also think this product is going to last me a very long while so it’s worth the money. The last big thing i would like to mention is since it’s a powder, you have to be extremely careful about getting water in in the container. That would definitely ruin the exfoliator completely and you’d have to repurchase. So I wouldn’t recommend using this in the shower if you’re clumsy and might get water in the bottle. Other than that I would recommend!",1.0
I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I think it’s my new go-to cleanser! It’s helps balance out the oiliness of my skin without making it too tight. I’m loving it so far!,1.0

Not a good Vitamin C product but does a nice job moisurizing. I have been using this for about 6 months and saw zero brightening and a dark spot did not fade at all. I recently switched to a different Vitamin C product and within one week the dark spot is almost gone! I like the squalene as an end product for my routine but the price point is so high I can’t justify ever buying this again.,0.0
"First off:It’s amazing that this product is clean and not harmful for your skin.But that being said my skin never feels clean after washing it and after running a cotton pad with toner there is just so much makeup left over.Although it’s smart to start off with an oil cleanser to breakdown makeup I don’t think it should be necessary.If you don’t wear makeup or are just starting out skincare I would recommend, but I would never purchase again.",0.0

I used for 3 weeks to give my skin a chance to adjust and it didn’t get better. I returned the product.",0.0
"Love!! I liked this alot. It does need a double cleanse, but it does take off most of my eye makeup gently and without irritating my eyes or leaving a residue. The smell also is also mild and kind to sensitive skin and noses.",1.0
Talk about a waste of money. I was moving and lost track of time so never returned this product. It wouldn’t take off my makeup at all I had to use another cleaner after. Do yourself a favor and find another cleanser.,0.0
"I have used products by Fresh beauty many times before and have quite enjoyed them as well. This time i was sent Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Face cream to review for free in exchange for my honest review. First off, i love the scent of this cream - it is very emollient and works well for my dry combo skin. I wore it under my makeup and it didn’t leave my face feeling greasy. Absorbed very well.  Will repurchase!",1.0
"I included this serum on my skin care forever. The formula of the serum is super light, it hydrates you from the first application, I am those girls who do not like sticky or heavy products on my skin. I really enjoyed use this product",1.0
"not for me, this is heavily scented and it seemed to dry out my skin. I had to use more than my normal moisture to compensate. I hardly noticed any improvement verse my other serums. not worth the astronomical price.",0.0

"I can honestly say I’m so glad I invested in this product. It has truly become a main staple in my skincare routine. I was a little scared at first but after almost a week of using this twice a day, I have noticed a difference in how my other skincare products take to my skin. I have sensitive cystic acne prone skin and my skin has been getting better by the days. It’s not an over night process so of course I don’t expect immediate results but surprisingly I have seen them. The Tatcha website sales a travel size for those that just want to try it and don’t want to spend so much. I’d say suggest that first. But overall I give it five stars and more than likely will be repurchasing again.",1.0
"The only good things are the smell and texture.  This lip balm actually DRIED out my lips more!  I keep reapplying, but my lips are still chapped; it’s just an endless cycle of useless reapplication.  The tube is humongous so it’s very awkward when applying, unless you have Kardashian lips.  I tried to like this but everytime I apply, my lips are more chapped.  $18 down the drain.  Save your money and use vaseline lip therapy, it’s cheaper and actually works!",0.0

"Tried this as a replacement for my glossier moisturizer, which I was underwhelmed with (it works, but isn’t super moisturizing so I figured for winter I may want to step up my game). I’m generally pretty balanced, clear-ish skin but fairly sensitive. The moisturizer felt pretty good going on, a little mor watery than expected, but I used it morning and night. Unfortunately, over the ~2 weeks I tested this moisturizer out, I noticed breakouts in places I never usually get them (temples, rough texture on forehead)- these are never problem areas for me regardless of diet, stress, etc. I also had additional breakouts in my “problem areas” - cheeks, between eyes - where I usually first see signs of something wrong. I stopped using the moisturizer about 4 days ago and have noticed all areas clearing up and becoming smoother since then, with no new breakouts.",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product. I loved how it made my skin feel incredibly fresh along with the wonderful eucalyptus smell. However, it left my face very red after each use and after a few days of using it, I had acne all over my nose (where my pores are larger). I never have break outs and it took weeks for my skin to recover. This is way too harsh for my skin and the ingredients clogged my pores which did the exact opposite of what a good toner is supposed to do. If you have sensitive skin, stay away.",0.0
"First step in instructions was to rub the pre-moistened pad over face until dry. I’m sure they didn’t mean bone-dry, but instead until the pad is no longer damp. I was rubbing that pad all over my face for what seemed like an eternity, which obliterates the illusion that this product is a simple and convenient use. Also makes me feel like i did more of the work to exfoliate my skin than the product did. That being said I would prefer to stick to my regular peel/exfoliate routine. My face did feel smooth after using this product though I feel that other products have given me a more satisfactory and lasting experience. I would recommend this to those looking for a mild peel.",1.0

Love this toner! Love the smell and the feeling of it on my skin. Really helps with break outs and getting the last bits of everything cleaned off of my skin after cleansing. My only complaint is I wish that inside the cap there was a better spout/dispenser for the toner. It’s a bit hard to control how much comes out. Other than that- highly recommend.,1.0

Love how this takes off all my makeup and the texture. My face is sensitive and in the past when I used make up remover it turned red and was irritated. This did not do that at all. Very pleased!,1.0
"It smells great and it feels like it’s actually moisturizing as soon as you put it on but it doesn’t leave my skin feeling moisturize throughout the day. My skin type is normal.

I am 44 and this is the first time I’ve used facial toner in my every day skin care routine.  This product really helps my dry face stay more hydrated.  I use it with a cotton ball every morning and it lasted almost a year. I also noticed it helped even out my skin tone--especially after a long run when my face was really red.,1.0
This is absolutely an amazing cleanser. Love the cream to foam aspect and it doesn’t foam too much. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser didn’t irritate my facial skin at all. I was amazed by how moisturizer my face/skin was after cleaning it. I didn’t need to hydrate it which is great. I’m loving it. I got this cleanser for free to try and I fell in love with it.,1.0
"I was super excited about this product. Friends recommend it & I saw it had great reviews. I have acne scars/dark spots, so I thought it would be perfect. I normally don’t suffer from sensitive skin, it pretty much adapts well to most products. Within a week of using this one, it left my skin feeling rashy & itchy. The texture of my skin just feels bumpy now. Once I stopped using the toner completely, my skin went back to normal. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone; it irritated my face too much.",0.0

"Have been using this each morning for close to a month in conjunction with other DE products. I haven’t been cleansing in the morning, so after splashing with water and toning with thayers I do the C-Firma serum with B-Hydra. Then depending on how dry I’m feeling (30 year old, fair, combo, slightly sensitive acne prone skin) I’ll do marula oil or the protini moisturizer and once that’s soaked in I top with a couple of pea sizes of this spf. (Others are saying moisturizer isn’t necessary with this, so I’ll try that and it may help my “wet skin” issue explained below.) It rubs in really nicely and doesn’t stay white. I don’t love the smell, which to me is the faint scent of wet dog, but it’s not strong enough to be too off-putting. Works totally fine under every bb cream, foundation or concealer I’ve tried (applied with beauty sponge). Just have to let the spf soak in first. If I don’t wait for it to soak in, my face feels almost wet or like it wants to sweat when topped with another product. Being winter and being inside most of the day, I can’t speak to how this will perform in Summer yet. So far, so good with no break outs or anything so I’ll be excited to try it then.",1.0
"Y’all I never write reviews but I feel like I must warn you about this product. My first reaction was that the glass bottle was beautiful, but it smelled very strongly of artificial watermelon. That should have been the first red flag.I used this in conjunction with my usual drunk elephant routine for about a week. My skin *hurts*. I broke out in this huge painful white heads all over my face and I never had breakouts like this solely using drunk elephant. Take this review with a grain of salt, I know all of us react differently to products. Just know your money is probably better spent somewhere else.",0.0

Ultimately not a fan, much prefer the overtime mask!",0.0
"when I first started getting sample of this product and trying it I was so happy that found something that would help my skin, I even started to look flawless, and the I bought the product as well, until I realized I started to breakout more, it’s the first and last time I buy it, because it played with my emotions.",0.0

"I wanted to love this product so much but it just did nothing for me. I bought a few new skin care products and started breaking out on my chin. I thought maybe the other products were the culprit so I phased them out and just used this cleanser with my usual products my skin likes. Unfortunately I continued to break out all over my chin. I only just switched to a new cleanser 2 days ago and already my skin looks better. I’m not saying it’s terrible, but I think that it may just have been a bit too light and didn’t really deeply cleanse my skin. Either that or my skin just did not like the ingredients",0.0

This one has a tad bit chemical smell to it I didn’t like. It a heavy moisturizer so I suggest keeping it light with usage.

Do you want to look gorgeous and glowy with bloodshot eyes and running mascara? Do you want to be blinded and in pain while youre driving in traffic with tears running down your face and your vision clouded so badly you think you might die? Then this is for you. You will enjoy exactly 20 minutes of your makeup looking nice before your eyes start to burn so badly you have no choice but to remove your makeup.

"This product is probably a great casual summer moisturizer, but isn’t something I’ll plan to buy anytime soon. I received a 1oz sample product when I purchased the Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer. The instructions on the back say to “apply as needed from head to toe“ so I decided to try it on my hands since I’ve been experiencing severe dryness this winter. I like that the product is light, there isn’t any strong or aggressive scents, and it absorbs quickly. However, I was disappointed to find that the product didn’t do a good job of hydrating my hands. I tried it consistently for a few days, to see if longer use would help – but unlike the product description mentions about immediate results, I didn’t see the results I anticipated. Eventually, I switched to the Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream and I noticed a much bigger improvement in my skin after a few applications. I was hopeful that, with a name like “Ultra Repair Cream“ that this product would be able to refresh my ultra dried skin, but in this case, the name seems to overhype the effectiveness of the product. I can see this as a good summer moisturizer to keep on hand, just in case, but overall, I won’t be switching to this product for everyday use.",0.0

From having a read through other reviews is it clear that there is something in this product that is an allergen to some people and not to others. so it is a gamble!,0.0
Amazing makeup remover cleanser but too oily for my combination skin. My skin broke out after about 3 days of using product. But seriously a great makeup remover.,0.0
i received this cleasing balm from PINCHme . Its a very thick face wash .My skin feels soft but I will not buy this product.,0.0
"I love this and only this from the brand. It is so moisturizing, sits beautifully on the skin and has a slight tingle. It smells good and leaves me with the brightest glow in the morning. 10/10!!!",1.0
"This cream pair great with the cleanser. It is light on the skin, but moisturizes so well! Thankful I received this free for testing.",1.0
"I have sensitive skin and this does sting and tingle at first but it dissipates after a minute or two. I just finished my 1st bottle of this and need to repurchase to see if it will fade dark spots with continued use, but this is a very good toner for textured oily/congested skin.",1.0
This was labeled as a first step/cleanser but it barely works as a pre cleanse. I have to use a lot of it to take of my makeup and even then go over it with another cleanser. I couldn’t imagine using it as a regular cleanser at all. Super disappointed,0.0
This moisturizer made my face really greasy and didn’t do a lick of removing any kind of wrinkles. I don’t suggest this product to anyone. It just wasn’t what I thought it would turn out to be like. The moisturizer sits on top of the skin rather than soaking into the skin. It feels so heavy on the face as if you have Vaseline on. I just don’t like that oily feeling on my face. It caused me to break out more and just wasn’t my kind of moisturizer. I have combination skin as well.,0.0
"I bought this product during the VIB Rouge sale event after years of being on the fence about it. I remember I didn’t like the after-smell of the product but I took the plunge anyway because of how good the reviews are. Honestly, I’m glad I did. It’s a excellent product and my skin has never looked better. I usually suffer from the random 1 or 2 larger pimples on my cheeks which the healing process can take a while—until SK-II that is! My only complaints are still with the after-smell (just personal preference) and the price tag. If you have the money and are still on the fence, get it. Your skin will thank you!",1.0
"Only had a one time use sample, it felt a bit tingly going on but not much, not to the point of discomfort. It didn’t seem to have any difference in my skin after one try. The smell was nice. My face felt nice but it didn’t feel any better than it normally does after my evening routine. It’s not bad but it’s not the mask for me at this time.",0.0
"I received this product as a free sample through Laneige to review. This is a milky toner that is super hydrating and with enough layers, it’s as moisturizing as a regular moisturizer. The texture is very watery yet it dries down to a velvety texture. Great for winter or on it’s own during the summer. I have oily skin so during the summer, I apply it after my face is cleansed, add on a couple layers then finish off with a light gel moisturizer. It just keeps my skin feeling plump and hydrated. There’s no discernible smell to it. I have both the Korean version and this. The product is exactly the same except this version in Sephora is in plastic packaging and the Korean version is housed in glass. Overall great for all skin types but especially so for drier skin.",1.0
"I’ve been using this serum for a couple of weeks and can tell for sure it makes a big difference for my skin. My pores appearance are starting to look better and even smaller, and it dries my skin in a very balanced way. I really like this serum and will definitely keep using it as my daily routine. #freeproduct  #trywithtopbox",1.0
"I picked this up on accident. I meant to grab the colored gloss. But since I have this one I decided to give it a try. I likethe ease of application. And the scent is nice. However, this balm is not very nourishing and did not last long on the lips.",1.0
"I love how hydrated my eye area feels when I use this cream. It’s so wonderful. I love that the consistency is a little thick and you can feel it hydrating your skin but, it doesn’t feel heavy.",1.0
"Very disappointed it, doesn’t not work for me.I get bumps under my eyes will never buy this again.",0.0
"I have mixed feelings about this product. I have found it nice to put under make up for a quick surge of moisture  in the morning. I have combo skin and tend to get dry patches under the eyes and on the cheeks. This was nice and quite easy to use as long as it was more for preventative measures. If I put it on after I noticed any sort of flaking the serum seemed to irritate my skin a little. The product also claims that it can be used over make up as a pick me up during the day. I tried multiple times to use this serum stick over different foundations but found that it would just move my foundation around and left me with a cakey look. I would recommend this product for those that may not really wear foundation and just wear a sheer tint of bb cream perhaps that like something they can carry in their purse for convenience. I was a little disappointed as I loved the packaging, the convenience, and promise of the product. I just thought it didn’t deliver in everything it claimed .",0.0
Ended up giving my nose a lot of black/white heads. Was excited to try this cleanser after loving the exfoliating one. But it wasn’t for me,0.0
"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I used this toner when I started having painful breakouts on my neck and lower chin. After three days, the acne on my neck and chin all dried up. I also had some blackheads on my cheeks, that I noticed were starting to clear and overall a smoother feel to my skin.It’s now part of my weekly acne routine but I wouldn’t recommend it for daily use as it can be drying. Maybe 2-3x a week to help reduce and curb any breakouts you’re having. If you’re on the fence about it, get it, you won’t regret it.",1.0
I must say at first I was never really a big fan of serums but this one changed my mind. It really does repair your skin overnight. It’s expensive but worth it. I received this great product complimentary for testing from Influenster. Oh how Amazing #GenerationANR #contest #complimentary @esteelauder @Influenster,1.0
"I definitely feel that this has been doing its’ job. I got a deluxe sample that I have been using. I do not have sensitive skin but this definitely can burn if I rub with a cotton pad or use twice a day. I’ve been using it in a gentler manner, patting my face with a cotton pad instead of rubbing it, which helps. I use this several times a week but daily or twice daily can be too much for my skin. I wanted to rate this 3 stars but I must say, I have seen improvement in my skin and it does warn that it can irritate. For me, it just can burn a little bit if I use it to often or harshly but I haven’t had lingering side effects after the fact. I would not recommend this at ALL if you have the slightest of sensitive skin or any blemishes or acne or have freshly gotten any part of your face waxed. THIS WILL BURN. Use with caution, and as another person commented, maybe try a patch test first. I will definitely continue to use the deluxe sample that I got but I’m not positive that this is something I would actually purchase as there is another toner I really like that that doesn’t feel so harsh on my skin...although I don’t think the other has made such a difference on improving the brightness and texture of my skin!",0.0
"Love this! Hydrates very well but doesn’t leave me feeling greasy or oily, and hasn’t caused me any breakouts.",1.0
"I wouldn’t call this a total transformation kit. I used the products as instructed for about 3 weeks, without seeing much result. For the first week I did have more breakouts as stuff came up to the surface, but by the end of trying it I didn’t notice much improvement in texture or tone. I will say, even if you only want the good genes serum this is still a better value than buying the full size because you need so little product that the mini will last you a long time.",0.0
"Excellent. Takes off even the most stubborn waterproof and long lasting mascara and liners, but still gentle on the skin. Does NOT sting or hurt if it gets in my eyes, which is a big deal for me. Excellent value for the amount of product you get. I’m on my second jar.",1.0
"It hydrated my lips pretty well but i could notice pimples building up around the mouth once i started using it, it did smell good though",0.0
"So let me be honest, Ive used this bottle for about a month and literally everyday and have not seen any improve or whatnot. It makes my face oily after applying and I feel oily the next morning I wake up. This hasn’t broke me out or anything but going to return.",0.0
"When this first came out I was desperately searching for something to help my painful dry skin. First few uses I hated it bc it left a film on my face. Which my skin was dry, but I didn’t want a film. I started using my son and park beauty water after I used it. It helped. I really liked it then. Fast forward, I ran out. I tried other cleansing balms, but they just didn’t do it. I went back to this. It has a super fine almost grit to it which makes me feel like I’m sort of exfoliating, but gently. Now a days I just do a double cleanse. I also found and love the makeup erasers. This balm never broke me out. My skin loves heavy moisturizes. For example, I use LRP Lipikar lotion in the pump and Eucerin q10 moisturizing lotion at night. Something thick and heavy like that.",1.0
"I swear by the serum and moisturizer in this line so I assumed I would love this but it did absolutely nothing for my skin. I never have reactions to products but the few times I used it, it caused lots of bumps on my forehead.",0.0
"I have oily, acne-prone skin and this face cream kept my skin stay moisturized throughout the day. It is very rich and thick but does not feel greasy or heavy. My skin feels plump after and my fine lines appeared to be less prominent. There is a pleasant fragrance and the packaging is absolutely gorgeous.",1.0
"Sorry, but I did not understand the hype. There are a lot of cheap alternatives in the market. At least it didn’t break out my skin.",0.0
"After about a month of regular use this product did two things: (1) hydrated my skin enough to get rid of *some fine lines, and (2) made my face a greasy mess. I tried using less, being intentional about where I applied the product, & rotating the application schedule. Some of these helped to cut down the greasiness as long as I only applied it at night (makeup makes it worse as this melted my WFH makeup right off).Overall, this was okay. This product did some of what it claimed at the cost of greasy skin. I’m not impressed & I’m glad I got this as a complimentary item.",0.0
"I’ll be quite honest I’ve never used any kind of drops but was really excited to give this a try as part of my routine. It was very simple and easy to use the dropper and apply the glow drops on. It helped restore my dull and tired skin( I only have 3 little boys haha). It helped give radiance and shine with more alive skin appearance. I love that it helps with hydration on the skin and gives my complexion a new me! I love that these Dr. Barbara Sturm glow drops have vitamin A and Omega 3 which I believe my skin doesn’t get enough of and reduces irritations. The wild rose extract helps my skin with the pores and helps my skin to look even(especially on pictures!). It’s been quite simple to use daily and just takes a few minutes a day! As someone who tries to minimize her makeup and look for natural looking skin, as well as prevent aging; This felt right for me! I have sensitive skin, I was a bit apprehensive at first but I was happy with the results as the days went on. When I do wear makeup, these glow drops felt like a great primer before putting make up on. Overall, I am satisfied with this product and plan on using it daily till I run out then restock! It’s truly a must have!",1.0
"Terrible packaging.  It’s just the kid screwed on, no box or shrink wrap seal to ensure it doesn’t spill in transit.  It has completely leaked over all of the other items I purchased in my order and the level is at the top of the sticker - quite a bit is gone now.  I haven’t even tried it as I had to clean everything, including my hands and counter so they wouldn’t go tan/orange.  Would not buy again unless the packaging is updated.",0.0

"Works amazing at removing waterproof makeup, it melts makeup away in under 10 seconds. I wear makeup daily and this container lasted me a year. I have acne prone skin and I did not have any issues. I use this first to melt makeup, rinse then follow up with my face wash. Holy grail product.",1.0
"I was kind of scared to use this product because I have sensitive skin, but I did it anyway!  This is a very simple system to use since both step are wipes.  I was pleasantly surprised that it worked well and that it didn’t tingle or burn.  I received a sample through PINCHme, and will be buying this product as soon as I can.",1.0
My least favourite for makeup removal. It irritated my contacts and my skin.,0.0

These didn’t work for me at all. Stuck them on my face all night and no affect in the morning. I have a very oily t zone so maybe it doesn’t work on very oily skin,0.0
"I love the simplicity of this product. I can do a swipe with a cotton pad over my face once or twice a day. It doesn’t have much of a scent, rather the smell is a little off putting. I have used this product for about a week now, and I thought to give it a fair review after using SK-II products exclusively for a week. I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin, really. My skin is mostly normal, or combo. Some areas are a bit oily and others are fine. I get small breakouts of acne mostly during my more hormonal time of the month. I exfoliate my skin a few times a week as well as use a hydration mask and a toning mask. This product to me is almost like my Thayers witch hazel toner, that I use pretty much daily. I also checked the price and noticed it’s much more expensive than I would ever spend on beauty or skincare products, so I would take a hard pass on it.",0.0

As a brown girl every time I see some congestion on my forehead or on a cheek I cringe because I know I’m going to have a zit/pimple and I know it’ll leave a scar due to good old hyperpigmentation (yay melanin).

As soon I see signs of congestion, I use this to spot treat the area and it works!",1.0

"I have been using this product for the past few days and really like the way it makes my skin look and feel. I like that it’s like but doesn’t feel drying at all. It also feels like it blurs my skin so when I just want to wear this it gives a nice even finish. The smell is nice not too strong although if your not a fragrance person you might not like it. I’m hoping with more use I will see some of the dark spots started to lighten on my face. It hasn’t been long enough to tell, overall I really liked this product.",1.0
"I’ve used a fair share of make up removers and this by far beats them all. Believe me and everyone else when we say that it melts your make up off and is gentle on the skin. I will say that I double cleanse but that’s just me, I go in with a liquid cleanser after using this just to ensure absolutely everything is off, but regardless of that, this cleanser is amazing. I love that it comes with a little spatula too, to get the balm out. I would recommend this to anyone who’s looking to try out a new make up cleanser!",1.0
I received this product free to try from Influenster. So far I like the product a lot. My skin feels clean and firm. Overall i will continue to use this product to see its full potential.,1.0
"As a Southern woman, I know good watermelon when I smell it and this toner kind of freaked me out the first time I used it. It’s scent skyrocketed me back to summer days spent lazying around outside, pool parties, and a certain nostalgia I can’t quite put my finger on...1. The large pores between my cheek and nose area do not suck up as much foundation as it used to (and doesn’t need as much product there)HOWEVER2. Something in the toner irritates my already irritated skin on my chin and right above where my unibrow would be if I allowed it to grow in (these areas are covered by my foundation and a color correcting concealer. So what IS this? PHA, or Poly Hydroxy Acids are a group of acids that work their magic slowly, which is great for sensitive skin that is prone to irritation and redness (which befuddles me as to why it does NOT help me). And BHA stands for beta hydroxy acid. BHAs are water-soluble acids made from sugary fruits. They help peel away the surface of your skin so that new, more evenly pigmented skin cells may generate and take their place.You would *THINK* that this toner would help my irritated skin, but alas, it doesn’t. My irritated areas peel, and true to the BHA, the peeling gets WORSE. With that said, I am enjoying the benefits from the scent and the pore cleaning/tightening on my nose and between said nose and cheeks.",1.0
"I really didn’t like this product. Really really. At all. First, let me say the packaging is beautiful and high quality;  totally Tatcha. It’s completely solid, ensuring no sunlight reaches the product. Superb. The pump dispenser worked great. However... This is really watery, so if you pump on your finger it runs off; you gotta pump it in your palm. OK, no problem; I prefer a little more ’gel’ in my consistency but no big deal. The 2 absolute no’s for me was 1.) The finish. This product refused to be anything other than sticky all hours all day all the time. Not tacky, mind you; sticky. Like ’I put this on before bed my face would glue to my pillowcase’ sticky. It was truly just an awful feeling; like after you sweat a lot and it dries, you just feel dirty. Any fuzz or lint would just stick and not come off. And nothing would tame it; not moisturizer, nothing.  2.) It just didn’t do anything but be sticky. I didn’t notice any difference in texture, discoloration, firmness, nothing. Now, I gave it 3 stars because of the high quality packaging and ingredients Tatcha is know for. But beyond that - no, Tatcha. No.",0.0
"Received my free trial of Clarins Double Serum from Butterly and have just completed my 7 day trial. While the results were not overly drastic after 1 week of use, the texture of my skin improved as well as the hydration. This is an excellent serum if you are looking for extra hydration during the cold and dry winter months, my skin was so bouncy after a week of using this! It had a light refreshing scent and was non-greasy. It absorbed quickly into my skin after application. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to add to their anti-aging skin care lineup, I will definitely be purchasing this product. For reference I am 31 years old, female, and have acne prone combination skin (oily t-zone yet prone to dryness in the winter)",1.0
"Uuuuum did I receive the same product that everyone is raving about in all these positive reviews?!? (Insert side eye) So again I had this in my cart to purchase and although there were a lot of positive reviews I was skeptical. I ended up choosing to get this as a sample with my order and I’m so glad I did because it definitely would have been returned!This is an average yet abrasive exfoliant that I would not justify paying $45+ bucks for. The sample I received I got three uses out of it and it did nothing that it claim to do other than dry my skin out and left my skin looking ashy and dull. It is a pretty rough exfoliant as far as you definitely feel like it’s buffing your skin and getting in there, but my skin didn’t show any improvement or look polished once I washed this off.It reminds me and have similar texture as the Youth To The People Yerba Mate Resurfacing Exfoliating Energy Facial with Enzymes Microdermabrasion Treatment. They both have those abrasive micro-exfoliant crystals that really exfoliate the skin, except with this one my skin didn’t show any improvement and I had to follow up with a hydrating mask.It didn’t have a scent, it didn’t break me out or cause any irritation, however it didn’t leave my skin smooth, glowing, or polished. For those reasons I wouldn’t purchase or recommend",0.0

"I really love how moisturizing it feels without being too heavy. I bought this thinking I could replace using a primer when using foundation. Even though it moisturizes, I also need something to even out my skin. I don’t have pimples or acne, but I do have some tiny bumps similar to milia and using this alone doesn’t cover them up. So I use this and a silicone based primer for the problem areas, but I really like this product.",1.0

I’m mostly combination skin that tends to get dry while also having occasional issues with acne and this hasn’t cause any issues for me.",1.0

"They work pretty well as long as you’re careful with how evenly you spread your lotion. If not, you can end up with streaks. I’m impressed with how long the tan lasts, about a week for me, and I use only three drops. Unfortunately, they can be quite greasy, and in my case, these drops left me with really significant breakouts, meaning I can only really use it on my body:/ It does have that fake tan smell, but it isn’t overpowering. Definitely start with a few drops at first, because it fully develops after 24 hours and can give you that orange hue if too much is applied. I would probably only recommend this for people who don’t struggle with sensitive skin or breakouts, they just werent a 10/10 for me…",0.0

"The product is really good. After applying it leaves my face moisturized, the smell is good. It is like a jello texture",1.0
The product doesn’t work as expected. CeraVe which is half the price works better for dry skin.,0.0
"I previously used a very inexpensive Elf cleansing balm as my first step, but I felt it did leave some oily residue on my skin. It did a great job getting my makeup off but I felt it left a film and battled oily skin and inbalances. When I used that up and did my homework on what to replace it with, this seemed like the HG for so many people. It is for me! I got the standard size and I predict this will last 9 months to one year, a pea size is all I typically need. Afterward my skin feels extremely soft but balanced. I usually do a second step cleanser, but sometimes i skip my second step and it does not seem to bother my skin. I remove with a wet microfiber cloth if I am extemely lazy and all is well. The smell is lovely. I may try a different scent or variation of this cleansing balm in the future, but I will not stray from this brand and similar formulas and I am now tempted to try other skincare items from them!",1.0
Always been a fan of their night lip mask,1.0
"Saw this posted a lot on Instagram and was really excited to try. Honestly it didn’t wow me at all, was a really standard product and not worth the cost. Glad I tried out the mini version. Won’t repurchase.",0.0
"Doesn’t last on my skin. I have tried it under primer, over primer, alone… I was really hoping this would be The One that let me go without foundation, but I would have settled for it helping me look less red after an hour. Oh, well.",0.0
"I originally received this in a Dr. Jart+ gift set, and it quickly became one of my favorite products. I use it as an alternative to foundation on most days, and I love that it color corrects and has SPF. I was skeptical since I’ve used other green-to-beige products that don’t fully blend and leave an odd residue, so I was super pleased. The texture is great, and I love the formula.",1.0
"As we all know, everyone has different skin types. I did a patch test on my neck first caused no irritation. Then  face started to apply to the lower half of my face once three days to get my face used to the new product. After one week, I started to apply every other day. After 4 weeks of use, I will say it is a solid product, at least for me, combination skin type with breakouts once a month. Now I apply both morning and evening as last step before face cream. Going to buy a new bottle now.",1.0
Overall I really found that this moisturizer worked great for my skin. I have combo skin and sometimes feel that certain things can make it feel more oily. This however did not and felt light on my skin.,1.0

"Unfortunately, she’s not doing what she was supposed to have done. I love Glow Recipe but unfortunately this is jus not it. The scent is overwhelming & it burns. I get some pilling as well which is annoying in general, but makes it even worse under makeup. The price point is also crazy when considering everything I already listed in addition to the size of the bottle.. skip. exit stage left",0.0
Bought this about a week ago! It feels so silky and smooth going on and it leaves my face feeling soft and glowy! This comes from someone who strugglesssss to find a cleanser that doesn’t make me feel stripped or too oily (I have acne prone oily skin) Love this for a fresh cleanse!,1.0
"When I first heard about this toner, I thought it sounded great, but there was no way I was going to spend $33 on a toner. I got a sample after wanting to try it, and I was immediately hooked, RIP my bank account. I use two other popular hydrating toners in rotation but they just don’t hold up to this one. I have combo skin but in the winter, my face just flakes all over and I really need that extra hydration. This feels so high end, soaks into skin great, hydrates, soothes, does it all!! This also doesn’t burn my face, which for some reason the others occasionally will do. Great for dry and sensitive skin.",1.0
"I love this stuff. Got originally as a mini size in the Korean skincare box and fell in love. I use this anywhere on my face that has a healing spot or irritation and am blown away with how wonderfully it works. use as a targeted treatment for spots (would prolly be too much for the whole face), but so happy with it!!",1.0
"Worth every single cent, I can’t live without this",1.0
"I received this as a complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This is a must have!! First, it smells awesome but it is not overpowering. It has a nice creamy consistency, and it is not greasy. I used this and let me tell you, my skin felt so moisturized and soft. A little bit goes a long way, I did not need a whole lot to feel the effects. I would 100000% recommend this!!",1.0
"Depends on if you think you like the feeling of chemical sunscreen. This formulation is very light thin and easy to spread but it also feels a bit greasy on the face, though it’s actually very matte. Personally I feel kind of grimy and prefer cream type sunscreen to this light kind of dry Vaseline or balm seque compound.",1.0
I really wanted to like this product but it pills up on your face and you have white clumps everywhere. It’s better to use before bed so you can wash it off in the morning but you can’t wear it out of the house or under makeup unless you want clumps everywhere.,0.0
"For anyone looking for a moisturizer that hydrates, doesn’t feel heavy and improves the appearance of the signs of aging that are the result of dryness, then this might be a product that addresses those issues. Although it has a dense and buttery texture, it sets to give skin a softly plump finish that I didn’t find too rich for my combo/oily skin.If you’re more concerned about improving the actual health of your skin though, this is a definite skip. The most glaringly obvious con is that this cream comes in jar packaging, which defeats the purpose of the claim that this cream is “SUPERCHARGED“ “anti-aging armour“ since any active ingredients will lose their effectiveness over the course of use. Constantly having to dip into a product isn’t what I consider “clean“ either. Then there’s the noticeable (but not unbearable) lemon-lavender scent: fragrance is never good for skin except for triggering potential reactions. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I can’t wouldn’t recommend it when there are other moisturizers that don’t have so many downsides as this new Confidence in a Cream.",0.0
"La Mer gifted me this samples to try. After a few days using them I can say they’re good, they are moisturizing, don’t leave the skin greasy looking, a small amount is all you need for the whole face. I emulsify the cream with my fingers and then pat it on my skin. Overall a nice product but the price is what let me down, I can get the same effect with a much cheaper moisturizer.",1.0
"I have struggled to find a facial cleanser that satisfies my combination skin since I started using Clinque’s 3-step system when I was 14 or 15. This is the most magical substance I’ve ever used on my face, it really does melt makeup away, and my face has looked clear and fresh since I began using it. I highly recommend also using the Farmacy Honeypotion mask as a weekly or twice-weekly ritual. A        Farmacy",1.0
"I’ve been using this product for about 5-6 weeks as a part of my PM skincare routine – and at first I wasn’t sure that it was doing anything. My oily T-zone was still getting as oily during the day. I knew that the effect was supposed to be cumulative – but I was beginning to get impatient. Then I tried also using it on my forehead UNDER makeup, rather than only in the evening – something I had hesitated to do before, afraid of pilling. And I am happy to report that it drastically cut down on my skin’s production of sebum and kept my oiliness to a minimum! So I don’t know if the difference was simply using it twice a day, instead of just once, but it works now. And for the money, who could possibly ask for more? Makes me look into buying more products by The Ordinary brand.",1.0

"I understand it’s a clean produced based on Sephora, but this natural fragrance causes hives around my eyes. Also I think the retinol ingredient makes my eyes feel drier.",0.0
"I wanted to like this but unfortunately, something in this product doesn’t work for me. It dried out the skin around my eyes to the point where the areas got red and flaky. I saw someone say that they use it to treat acne scars so I’ve been using this on scars on my arms and legs and I think it’s actually making a difference! Obviously won’t be repurchasing, but glad I could find a way to repurpose the rest of this expensive cream.",0.0
"I loved the older formulation, almost all natural ingredients. Beware they now changed the formulation, more chemicals including silicon-based polymer (dimethicone, which can occlude skin pores). One of the reason for buying it was absence of this ingredient, in almost all creams nowadays. Returning it. Why do you have a great product and then you change it to make it worse?",0.0
"This is the first time I’ve ever written a review for a product, and I thought it was appropriate considering this is the only product I’ve ever returned. I’m no skincare expert, but over the last six months I’ve tried to start taking my skincare seriously. I’ve tried quite a few Drunk Elephant products, many of which I like, but I still couldn’t seem to kick my mild/moderate acne. I cut out the straight Marula oil after giving it the good ole college try, but I kept noticing that my face was getting increasingly greasier throughout the day after my morning routine. I went bare skin for a day to see what happened - no grease. I started trying things one at time to find the culprit...and this was the winner. I sent the second tube I ordered back in hopes of cutting the extra oil and clearing my face a bit. Giving it all the benefit of the doubt, this stuff feels AMAZING when you first apply it. It’s almost pillowy. But yes, it is THICK. It’s probably great for someone with really dry skin or someone who isn’t prone to breakouts. But is it for EVERYONE? Absolutely not DE",0.0

"As someone with combination skin, this gel creme is both hydrating and brightening! This type of creme is perfect for any season, except for summer because it is very moisturizing. If used during winter, you’ll most likely have to use more product than usual. For me, about 1-2 finger tip dip into the creme and that is enough for me. I’ve received this product as complimentary from Influenster for sampling purposes and the review is strictly based on my own opinion.",1.0
The serum feels sticky. I didn’t see a noticeable didference. Didn’t work for me,0.0
Received complimentary from drunk elephant. I love that it’s freshness is not activated until you actually mix the powder and liquid together. Freshness lasts for 6 months thereafter which is very doable. Pure Vitamin C is something I’ve always been behind!,1.0

(btw my skin is oily n acne prone). i really tried to make it work. but in hindsight, it did a good job of removing all of my excess makeup that my makeup remover failed to remove. that’s about it. also, this cleanser has fragrance my skin highly hates fragrance but this is on me bc i just wanted to be boujee n ignore ppl’s reviews so I’ll take this L on this purchase.",0.0
"First things first, as a general rule I don’t leave negative reviews. Because different strokes for different folks, and all that, y’know? And honestly, there’s enough negativity on the Internet already- I don’t like adding to it. But then I remembered Sunday Riley got caught padding positive reviews. So that, coupled with the fact the full size is only $15 shy of a Benjamin? Here ya go:I received this is my PLAY! box, and really wish I hadn’t. I’m not even sure where to start. It’s thick, and not in a good way because it doesn’t spread easily (or at all). Every single high end product I’ve ever tried just glides on, and I barely have to use any for a full face application. Not this stuff. It’s stodgy af, and refused to thin out and let me spread it on. So I just had to keep applying more.It refused to soak into my skin. I decided not to rush it, hoping maybe if it had some time to warm up it might thin out a bit, and soak in. Nope. After twenty minutes this sludge of a “serum“ was still just sitting on top of my skin. It also has a very tacky finish which made it impossible to put on my moisturizer. I actually had to rewash my face. I have NEVER had to do that before. (That was when I decided to write this.) All that being said, the scent is absolutely lovely.Again, I realize different things work for different people so I’m not saying don’t buy this, I’m just saying don’t buy into the plethora of “I TRIED THIS AND NOW I’M MARRIED TO HARRY STYLES!!!“ reviews. Definitely try a sample/travel size before dropping the full $85. Hey, maybe it’ll work for you and you’ll marry Harry Styles. Or maybe it won’t, and you should try LilyAna Naturals Vitamin C Serum for a fifth of the price.",0.0

"This product smells sort of like a weak mimosa, I was expecting a better smell especially with it being papaya. It is supposed to be a cleansing balm. The instructions say to massage into face for about a minute and rinse with luke warm water. When using this, it felt like chapstick to be quite honest which was such a disappointment because the packaging is nice, the jar is modern and simple and a beautiful color making it look and feel like good quality. It even came with a cover to reseal along with the lid to preserve it longer, and a reusable scoop for the product. Works great at removing makeup, but both my sister and I used it and agreed it does leave behind a residue. This would be a good product to use before a shower so you can do a better cleanse to remove the residue. I prefer lightweight products to remove makeup and this was not it. But if you have super dry skin this make work for you! I have dry cheeks and this still felt like I put Vaseline or chapstick on my face.",0.0

I use a heavy moisturizer for the night but once I used this one instead and my skin felt super tight. Also in very dry winter weather, this may not be the best choice for people with dry skin. A little goes a long way so the price is kind of justified but I’m still not sure if I would purchase again.",1.0
If I could give this 3.5 stars I would. This does a really great job of exfoliating and it definitely leaves you with a radiant glow. You do need to use a decent amount each time you use it. Something in this product did irritate my skin. The mornings after using this in would have little red dots all over my face. BUT I would say it is worth giving a chance to see if the ingredients agree with your skin because it is a great scrub.,1.0

This is way to expensive for the amount of product in it. $79 for only 1.69 oz. This will last you LESS than a month if you’re using it everyday and night. There are so many cheaper moisturizers with much more product. Don’t waste your money on something that’s not worth it.,0.0
"Initially, I was really excited to try this toner because of its good reviews and recommendations from family members. A couple nights ago I used the toner and woke up the next morning with pimples and bumps all over my cheek. I continued using it because there have been toners that irritate the skin first, but go away after a day or two and boom you get great skin. I woke up today with swollen, red eyes that looks like an allergic reaction. I never applied the toner on my eyes. The closest it has been near my eyes would be at my temples.

This lip mask made my lips crack, peeling, and left more dry than originally. It fools you at first because it feels so smooth and silky when first applied.",0.0
"I really love this balm. I first received a sample and was skeptical, but I’m now on my second big jar. It always removes all my makeup, and there’s not even a trace of mascara. It’s also moisturizing so my skin feels great after using. I’ve also noticed fewer breakouts. It may be a little spendy, but it’s more than worth it. The large jars have lasted me around 6 months each.",1.0
Feels luxurious. Smells phenomenal. Enclosed inside an easy-open container. Pay the price for a quality product.,1.0
I recently received a free sample from pinchme of Algenist Triple Amgae Eye Renewal Balm with Milti peptide complex. Non greasy and soothing on the eyes. This is in my top three favorites.  If can try a sample.,0.0
"I didn’t see all my lines magically disappear, but that is a job for fillers. I did see the skin around my eyes become more moisturized, and look so much brighter. Definitely brings a more youthful appearance. I really can’t use this product during the day though, it seems very thick, almost a little heavier than I really prefer, but it is so wonderful for night. Regardless of how much I move around at night, when I wash my face the next morning this product is still on !",1.0
I’m not a big skincare person but I’ve always wanted go be so I decided to try this product. My skin isn’t necessarily bad but I dealt with acne in my early teens (I’m 20 now) and have some scars left over. I thought this would burn the crap out of my face but the first time I used it it barely tingled and I noticed a difference the next morning! I’ve used it 4-5 times now every two days and my skin is glowy and almost perfect and acne scars are fading. I had a HUGE under the skin pimple popping up near my hair line and I made sure to get some of the honeymoon glow on it and the next morning it was barely there. This is my holy grail product!! I use it with the first aid beauty moisturizer.,1.0
"I have been using this product for about 4 months now. Initial thoughts: sticky, smells pretty good, nice instant glow. After a few weeks: I found that it irritates my skin if I repeatedly swipe on one area, so I’ve been avoiding that. I also reduced the frequency of use. More than 3 times a week irritated my skin. I’m not sure if that’s due to the fragrance and limonene, or simply because it’s a potent AHA. The product does claim to be gentle for daily use, but I don’t see that being the case.After a few months: So far I’ve seen very minimal results on my hyperpigmentation. However, it did reduce some of my newer pigmentation (which usually fades on its own, but this sped up the process). But it does add a nice glow! I find that it is too drying, even with reduced use. I’m trying to see if using it twice a week works for me, but at the same time I’m not sure if it’s even worth it for the minimal results that I’m seeing.",0.0
This is ok.  It is an extra step to washing my face.  I don’t see the need for it when my face wash does the same thing.  But it was worth the try.,0.0
This exfoliant is surprisingly gentle. I really like how it foams up when you apply it. I just make sure my hands are super wet like the instructions say. It makes my complexion soft and bright after use! Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling,1.0
This is a really smooth oil but I don’t use it a lot. I felt like it really encourages my breakouts plus it felt really heavy on my face. But I did love smooth it felt. I loved the smell and texture when I wasn’t wearing it.,0.0
Broke me out with tiny red bumps. Smells like an orange creamsicle.,0.0
I like this product but it isn’t worth the price tag IMO. It works well for dry skin and doesn’t feel heavy. I also like that it doesn’t have a noticeable scent like other YTTP products. Overall I feel like my CeraVe moisturizer does an equal (if not better) job for a third of the cost.,0.0
Safe for daily use. A little goes a long way. Skin feels incredibly soft and radiant after use. Many compliments. Repurchased twice already.,1.0
"On the plus, it does totally clean off all makeup, dirt, oils. Too drying for a daily wash though. Caused my skin to flake, even my eye lids. Would only recommend for a night wash after a FULL face of makeup or for someone with very oily skin. Not gentle enough for more sensitive skin.",1.0
This product is amazing! I received this as a complimentary product to test and review and I am very happy with the quality of the product! It’s very hydrating and leaves skin supple and luminous!! My favorite part is the smell though- like an orangecicle! I will definitely be repurchasing!,1.0
"Really pleased with this scrub.  The smell is nice and refreshing and the consistency is really nice.  Not too mild, not too abrasive.  Just love this.  Will definitely repurchase after I go through the first tube.  Skin felt nice and soft and it got rid of all the flaky skin I had from using some of my other chemical products.",1.0

"I was in the process of healing my acne scars and just wanted to try something to maybe help out in the process of making my skin healthier and brighter, I tried this woke up the next morning with 5 painful bumps that are clustered on both sides of my cheeks that soon grew into big painful zits, and they kept adding until my cheeks were full of new pimples. I was so devastated. I’m actually depressed cause no matter how much makeup I put on it couldn’t conceal my scarred and bumpy face anymore. I tried it because of the positive reviews from people with acne issues and for the price I thought I got nothing to lose. Well now I am losing a lot of money trying to look for remedies that will fix the damage this little bottle of evil has done to my face. Used it once and my situation got so much worse. If I could only go back. Consider consulting a dermatologist before you use this, or take a look at my photo and consider that.",0.0
This has changed my skin routine. My face is no where near as oily after a 12 hr shift in a mask.,1.0
Made me breakout so badly! Never had a reaction like this to a product before. Really wanted to love it since it has great ingredients but it’s a no for me.,0.0
"It works really well, so I’ll give it a 4. And as I mention later, I’m still using this. But I won’t give it a 5 because of the ingredient list, namely the essential oils, which I don’t think most people pay attention to.In particular, Lime, Bergamot, and Orange oils are often phototoxic, meaning they damage your skin in the sun. This effect can be mitigated if the oils are processed in a way to remove the furanocoumarins, but I haven’t been able to find out how the oils in this are processed. Even then, those oils are a frequent skin sensitizer.Green Clean is a rinse-off product, so phototoxicity and sensitivity is less of a concern, but anyone who has used this knows it does leave behind a slight film, even after a double cleanse. So I totally understand why people love this, and I’m still working through my tub as well, but I would only use this at night (which is probably when you’re taking your makeup off anyway), and with a thorough cleanse afterwards.",1.0
"First gel moisturizers are my absolute favorite for my dry skin. I also love the packaging of this product. The first downside, the moisturizer is scented. While I actually like the fragrance, I try to avoid scented products on my face. The second down side, the product is a little sticky. While it’s great for night time, I have to use a different moisturizer for the day time. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0.0
Amazing!  I constantly have chapped lips.  I’ve used many other products at night that never work.  This is legit stuff.  Makes me want to try their other products.,1.0
"Not for me. It left my skin oily, and I didn’t see any brightening or fading of a few acne scars even after using it for two months. However, after switching to another vitamin c serum, my constant mild breakouts stopped, which leads me to believe this was the culprit. The smell is nice, but I think it was just way too heavy for my skin. I think there are better products for a more reasonable price.",0.0
"Maybe I have just started to max out my beauty routine as far as serums and treatments go, but once I added this into the mix I have noticed some major piling once I begin makeup application. I do like the texture when I apply it. It is very refreshing and moisturizing. Sadly I just can’t find a way to stop the piling without leaving it out of my routine.",0.0

"I don’t understand the hype behind this product. I’ve been using it over the last few weeks and all its done is dry my skin out and made my cheeks appear more splotchy. No improvement whatsoever in the texture of my skin. Absolutely not worth it, especially given the absurd price.",0.0

"Loved it but broke me out the next day!  I wore it and thought to myself... finally something that looks just perfect on my skin.  It’s light feeling, perfect amount of hydration and definitely blurred red and hyperpigmentation.

My only complaint is that it isn’t very hydrating despite the fact it makes my skin look glowing. I have dry skin in the winter though.",1.0
I’ve made sure to use this for well over a month to see how my skin reacted. It’s a typical thick white sunscreen but has skin benefits beyond protecting your skin from the sun. It definitely leaves your skin moisturized initially and then absorbs into your skin and makeup applies easily over it. A little goes  along way and you can check off sunscreen for your daily routine. I haven’t noticed my skin becoming oily as the day goes on but I also haven’t noticed much skin improvement.,1.0
"I love the Beste No 9 Jelly Cleanser! At 35 years old, I started to steer clear of gel cleansers because they would strip my skin of moisture. That is not at all the case with this one! I typically use cleansing balms/oils these days, but I like to double cleanse and had been looking forever for something like this! It cleanses skin so incredibly well while not stripping it. It has no added or artificial fragrance, and a little bit goes a long way which means it will last! This cleanser is truly great for any skin type, even and especially sensitive.",1.0
"This product used to be really great. I’m very pale with a lot of acne scarring and this used to be all I needed, no more foundation. Then something changed and the formula is very orange and no longer works for me. Very disappointed that I have to go back to foundation.",0.0

"I don’t know if mine was from a bad batch or expired stock but it is not good at all. I’d heard it was preferable to the ordinary’s squalane cleanser which I enjoy, so I thought I’d give it a try. The Ordinary’s cleanser is perpetually out of stock and more expensive. -This cleanser smelled off, like an expired lipstick. - It was extremely difficult to squeeze out of the tube until the 5th use and then it started coming out half solid half liquid, so it has somehow separated. I do not keep this in a warm or cold room. - it is difficult to spread into your face. The instructions say to dampen your face first which is unusual for a balm cleanser and also doesn’t make it work very well- It doesn’t rinse completely. There is definitely a residue. This does break up my makeup for a first cleanse but using it alone is not an option.",0.0
"OMG y’all! This glowrecipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Glow Drops make my glowy makeup dreams come true. This product can be worn under makeup as a glowy base and also over makeup to add a glossy highlight to the skin. My favorite way to use this is as a glowy primer. When applied, it absorbs fast into the skin and leaves a beautiful sheen to the skin. It has a really smooth texture to it so it just glides right over your skin. I didn’t notice it making a difference to the longevity of my makeup but i love the way it makes my skin feel, so that was what made it stand out to me. I am really happy to have this in my collection! *Product was gifted to me by glowrecipe but all thoughts and opinions are 100% my own*",1.0
"I live in Chicago, where winter means cold, wind, and excessively dry air. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream, which I received as a sample, is a standby product for me.

It’s lightweight and sinks in quickly, and makes my face feel like a dream. A forever repurchase.",1.0

"I’ve been using this for over 12 weeks and I’m not sure if I see enough difference to love it. I’m newer at the skin care game so I chose Tatcha products since they’re more on the “natural” side. I did notice the softness in my skin. But...big but...I also started developing little raised blemishes along my cheeks. I don’t think they’re pimples necessarily. Just little raised areas that do turn to pimples if I pick at them. Anyway, the 4th week was the worst. I guess my skin started purging but I stuck through the routine. It’s settled a bit now but the little bumps are still there. My skin before using anything fancy was calm...not acne prone at all, just the occasional pimple or two. But now...I sometimes feel like I was better off with my over the counter products. I have the Tatcha facial wash, water cream and dewy cream, this vitamin c, and the essence. It’s too late now to return so I will use up these products since they did cost a lot of money. The only thing I feel I would repurchase is the water cream. It works well for under make up.",0.0

I really don’t love this moisturizer. I have combo skin with acne scarring on my cheeks and my skin just wouldn’t absorb this moisturizer in some areas at all and my skin would be super dry in others. I ended up mixing this with jojoba oil and I use it for my neck and chest now.,0.0

"Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Youth Power cream smells fresh and was gentle on my skin. It didn’t feel greasy and absorbed well. It didn’t irritate my occasionally sensitive skin or eyes. A little bit did not go a long way, and i used about a large pearl size on my face and another on my neck. I used it day and night and felt well hydrated while I used it. I’m not sure of the long-term benefits on my skin as the sample size was too small to use it for a significant amount of time. In the time I used it the primary benefit I experienced was hydration.",0.0

Not for sensitive skin. Makes my skin burn almost every time I apply it..,0.0
I really love this moisturizer. I was initially really nervous because I have very sensitive skin and moisturizers that have a thin consistency in the past have burnt really bad when putting them on my skin. This had a light scent that wasn’t overpowering and it felt so light and good on my skin even right out of the shower. It kept my skin feeling soft for several hours and I used it as a primer.,1.0
I received this complementary to try from Influenster. This smells AMAZING! It’s so hydrating and refreshing on my skin! It evened out my complexion and I even see my pores shrinking!,1.0

"First things first if you’ve never chemically exfoliated don’t even attempt to use this everyday or your face will react badly. Start with once a week and gradually increase. However if your like me and are familiar with chemical exfoliators you’ll love using this daily. I had the ordinarys glycolic toner and honestly it didn’t do much for me it helped kind of but it burned way too much for me. If you are sensitive to glycolic acid nut want an amazing chemical exfoliator that leaves your skin glowy, smooth and reduces the look or pores I’d pick this one. I’m planning to buy another one as backup once I reach the halfway point. Just get it and try it out.",1.0

"I received a free sample of this products for an honest review and used it 2xs a day for almost two weeks.  The cream is on the heavier side, but not too thick where I felt it was suffocating my combo skin.  There was no discernible fragrance and it absorbed easily.  I was happy with the amount of moisture it provided and I think it’s gentle enough for anyone with sensitive skin.  My only reservation is for the price point, I would expect to be a bit more wowed by the product.  I’ve tried many different moisturizers from low end to high end and there was nothing about this one that stood out as super special compared to others.  I would happily use it again, but it’s one that I can easily forget as well.",1.0

I used this product for a month with no change in the dark circles. I did apply the product morning and night. The consistency was great, very smooth and silky without the sticky feeling afterwards. The sample size was more than enough to last all month as a little goes a long way. The scent was not strong, but soft and pleasant. Even though I did not get the desired results for my under eye circles, it may work for wrinkles. I do not have eye wrinkles, so I am unable to attest if the product works for that issue.",0.0

I just hate that l love it so much because of the price. But it is so important to invest in the health of your skin, so if something works, I am all for it! This is a lightweight but “heavy“ moisturizer. Meaning if you have normal to dry skin like I do, it needs something extra and this delivers everything that I need. It offers such a beautiful glow underneath my makeup and my makeup doesn’t slip or move around. Winters in New England are tough for my skin this time of years and using this, I have had zero dry patches. If you’re looking for an anti-aging cream that hydrates and takes care of your skin in the long run, this is it!",1.0
I ordered this by accident thinking it was the aqua bomb gel moisturizer. After a few days I noticed some clogged pores and a few new blemishes. I think this was the culprit as nothing else changed.

I see that it says it can also be used as a primer. I did try it that way - applied the moisturizer and then my makeup. It absorbed right away and didn’t pill like some other products can. I’m undecided if it helped my makeup stay on any longer or look smoother, but as for a moisturizer, I like it quite a bit. I am all for a two-in-one product.",1.0

Haven’t really used eye creams prior to receiving this product so I don’t have much to compare it to. I recently moved to Dallas and this is my first experience dealing with very cold weather.

I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.,1.0
I’ve heard so many good things about Drunk Elephant and this was my first experience with them and it missed the mark. For $78 (I guess you can pay in installments but still!) I cannot recommend this product. I appreciate that they were trying to keep this product fresh for the best results but the way the directions were worded caused me not to get any of this product at all. I don’t think it even mixed right and I had a hard time screwing off the top to be able to mix the product in. I went from being super excited to super frustrated. I think if they made an easier to mix container it might be good but this was personally too complicated for me.,0.0

Bought this because a bunch of youtubers have been recommending it. The.thing I hate most with moisturizing lip products is when it seems to help at first and then ends up making you use it more often because it’s actually drying out your lips more. I don’t think this lip mask does that at all. The scent is delicious. Super subtle but thats what I love about it. Not a neauseating perfume chemical scent. It’s a soft yummy scent. My lips feel soft and moistured in the morning. And I like that it lasts all night. I am pleasantly surprised BC I thought this would be something that would disappoint me. Happy to be wron!,1.0
I love this stuff. I put it on after my serum but before moisturizer. It goes on clear - can’t see it. And it has a matte finish so when I put on my moisturizer I’m not all greasy and shiny. Feels like there is nothing on your skin. Will be my face sunscreen for good,1.0
"I was really excited to get this. With all of the great reviews, it seemed like the perfect product for me since I have combo skin with larger pores/blackheads, but this actually did the opposite of what it says it’s supposed to do.

"The smell of this is relatively light (it smells faintly of honeysuckle, which I do love) and it feels nice going on. However, it is not moisturizing on my dry skin. It does make my face baby soft but I feel tight and dry about 10 minutes after application. I’ve tried it in the fall, winter, and now early spring and found it performed the same in all 3 seasons. I’m hoping that it will fare better in the hot humid summer but for dry skin I’d recommend something else in the winter/fall/spring.",0.0
"Unfortunately it’s giving more ghee (a clarified butter similar to coconut oil thats slightly grainy at room temperature) have this in Vanilla. I bought after seeing very pretty girls with it online and seeing good reviews. I’m used to lanolin, richer lip balms. I would not recommend this to heal dry cracked lips. It is thinner than many similar options such as Laneige Lip Sleeping mask. The scent is nice but not strong or lasting.  Don’t fall for the hype alone if you are on a budget",0.0
"Personally, I wasn’t the biggest fan of this. After reading a ton of reviews, I finally took the plunge and decided to purchase this.

When I tried to squeeze the tube and massage the product to see if I could get it to come out of the tube, the top seam of the tube split and started leaking product. Not even worth the affordable price.",0.0

"I received this product for free from Influenster to test it out. This was an okay product for me. It didn’t have a strong scent and had a nice light texture but I didn’t notice much difference with my skin. Either the product wasn’t suitable for me or I needed more product and time to test it out longer. I didn’t notice breakouts or irritation with this but everything is ymmv so if this looks like something you want to try, check the ingredients first.",0.0

Nice product. Slightly greasy application but leaves skin soft.,1.0

I tried the Dr. Dennis Gross daily peel in extra strength and hands down a great product. I was a little scared trying it at first because its a peel and I have sensitive skin.

"I had a very small trial size of this, and chose to use it as a potential night cream. The size was so small that even using a tiny amount only once per day, I probably only had 2 weeks worth. The first thing I noticed was that the smell was very distracting. It’s a clean smell but not necessarily medicinal, and I noticed it for quite a long time after applying. The real issue I noticed a couple of days later. I have combination skin, and this contributed to a huge increase in blackheads. Even on parts of my face where I don’t typically get any acne at all like my cheeks and my neck. I don’t know how to start on what it did to my poor forehead. Suffice to say the removal strip I used looked like a map of the Swiss Alps. This as my night moisturizer was the only change I made, and I was moving from Sunday Riley’s CEO moisturizer (which I love) to this. All in all, I used it for about 6 days before tossing the trial size.",0.0

So far I’ve been using The Essence for about 2 weeks and have used it about 7-8 times before bed. I am already noticing brighter skin!

"After 7 months using this product I’m ready to write a review. Don’t buy this product expecting to see results fast. It took me probably 5-6 months to notice differences in my skin. When I started using this product, It would give me acne in the following day every single time! But because it was so expensive, I continued using it. Then, after a while, probably 3 months, I stopped having acne with its use. This product helped to smooth some light acne scars (from the past) I had on my cheeks, and definitely helped to reduce brown spots on my face. It did not help with fine lines (I’m 28 years old). I would recommend this product to someone that has the same problems I had (light acne scars and some brown spots). However, I’m not giving it a five stars, because it took too long to improve my skin.",1.0

I wanted to love this product so bad. The only reason I wear foundation is because of my redness. I have combo skin.

"I received a sample of one pad. I applied the product at night and layered with a moisturizer, as it advised. The moisturizer did sink into my skin in the most luxurious way. So smooth! When I rinsed my face this morning, I didn’t see a crazy difference from the night before, but I use chemical exfoliators regularly. For the price of ~$10 per treatment, it’s cheaper than the spa, but I wouldn’t purchase on my own (from the results I saw after one treatment). This may have long-term improvements if you use regularly, but I can’t be certain.",0.0

"I have a problem where I pick at my bottom lip when I get really anxious to the point that it’ll bleed. Yuck, I know, sorry. Not even medicated lip balm helps, even when I go days without messing with my lip. It’s just constantly chapped. I exfoliate and moisturize, I’ve tried every high-end product I could with no luck. But this stuff works so, so well, and a little bit goes a long, long way. It feels nothing like gloss, although it is very thick. I haven’t NOT had chapped lips in forever. I use it every night and not only has it healed my lip entirely, but it really has made my lips SO much plumper. It’s that nourishing. If you’re going to spend anywhere near $20 on a lip balm or salve or whatever, stop right here, this is the best.",1.0
"This review is based off of a sample that I took home. (So figure in the exposure to light, etc) I was really impressed with this. Honestly, I assumed I’d never even consider buying the full bottle because of the price. My favorite so far is philosophy’s retinol cream... it was. I’m torn honestly. The price of philosophy’s is better and the results are amazing. The only thing this one might have over that one I feel is this def helped with texture instantly. I woke up every morning with smooth plump skin. I tried their babyfacial as well but this did more for texture against that in my opinion. One star deducted because price and the fact that I only got a couple weeks out of that sample. There are so many other retinol that are out there with a lore budget friendly price.. however, I am strongly considering making room for a splurge at full price. I think one more sample will help make that decision.",1.0
"I got a sample of this cream from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. A tiny sachet went a long way – approximately 3 days. It was a bit too heavy for me in terms of its texture because I prefer lighter gel-like creams, and, honestly, my fine lines and crow’s feet did not go anywhere. So I am not sure if I can recommend it.",0.0

I tried both methods and the product just wouldn’t change color. I looked like Shrek. I will be returning this product.",0.0

"I am pleased with Sunday Riley ICE Ceramide Moisturizing Cream. I have dry skin. I like how it makes my skin feel hydrated and, my face looks smooth and radiant after use. It feels light when using it on my face and not greasy when blending it into my skin. My favorite features are that the ingredients it has in it beetroot and coconut extract helps to hydrate my skin, and ceramides, vitamin F, and pomegranate sterols help to seal in the moisture. I use it twice a day, first thing in the morning after washing my face before applying my makeup and then again at night before bedtime. I love this stuff and would recommend it. It works great and does not break me out either.",1.0

"This product is just not great. The initial smell is off-putting. The texture of the product is very sticky, and it feels sticky and thick when you apply it. The product then dried into a shellacked layer on my face, making every wrinkle, discoloration, and fine line very apparent. It almost looks like an egg white mask. I didn’t see any improvement with my skin, and it actually seemed to dry out my skin, which already had problems with flakiness. Would not recommend for skin types like like. Product doesn’t deliver promised results, and honestly my moisturizer is better at plumping my skin.",0.0
"I only got a sample size and usually I can’t make a full decision about skincare until after I finish a full size and sometimes I have to rebuy something before I know if I like it. This reminds me an awful lot of a essence from from a popular Korean skincare brand. It’s very nice and not sticky feeling. Is it worth the price tag???? Probably not. But it does work very nicely. My skin looks refreshed and awake and plump after using it. Maybe if this were on sale at some point, but there isn’t anything groundbreaking to have me buy this again. Do not get me wrong though, it’s a very nice product that plays very well with all of my other skincare and makeup.",1.0

"I have had tiny bumps covering my forehead since high school (about 6 years).  After high school my skin cleared up of the heavy acne but the tiny bumps remained.  I talked to doctors, estheticians, got facials, and spent so much money trying any mask or treatment that might get rid of them.  THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT DID IT.  After two uses this mask COMPLETELY cleared those bumps up for me.Now, since having those cleared I have used the mask one more time and it is just too abrasive for my skin so I just don’t use it anymore and it is not apart of my skincare routine.  But clearing those bumps up was absolutely worth the high price tag and the bumps have never returned.",1.0

I got this from Sephora as a deluxe sample and I would have been pretty unhappy if I actually paid for a full size item. On the plus side no allergic reaction and I do have sensitive skin. It glides on very smoothly and the term “sheer“ is accurate as I didnt really notice any color on my lips. That being said there was something very unpleasant about the taste and despite giving the product a decent try over a few days I found that it really did make my lips feel drier than before I applied. I own two lip masks in the $20-$25 range that are incredibly moisturizing with no unpleasant taste issues so I have no problem splurging on a lip product when it’s worthwhile. To me this just isn’t one of those products.,0.0

The dry winter weather caused eczema patches around my eyes and I was hoping this would help, but it did nothing. Just sits on the surface of my skin and doesn’t absorb very well. It’s ok as a regular moisturizer, but I think for the price it’s not worth it. I’m sticking to FAB ultra repair cream.",0.0
"This caused tiny pimples and a lot of irritation around my eyes and cheeks within a week. At first, I thought something else must be causing this, but after reading other reviews, realized it was the thickness of this cream that must have caused “milia“.

"I feel very neutral about the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Multi-Recovery Complex serum with an all new formula. That is largely attributed to the small, one week, sample I was fortunate enough to receive complimentary for testing purposes. I mention this because the clinical results were tested on women after using the product for three weeks. Although my skin is visibly smoother, much more hydrated (NOT oily) and more radiant, I feel like I would experience and see the other touted benefits with prolonged use of this serum. The past week wasn’t enough to make me go splurge on the full size serum, but it was a nice treat for my skin.",0.0

Caused cystic acne and definitely was not “purging.” I find the sadly many of the ordinary products are too potent for my skin, or maybe it’s something in the ingredients, but they irritate my skin to the point where it makes my break out bad and messed up by protective barrier. Making my skin look dull and irritated. A lot of the products had his effect over time. At first it looked like it was working wonders for my skin! But after 3 -5 months my skin started reacting negatively.This product work wonders for a month or so then I started to get cystic acne. Started on my chin. So I switched to the powder version. That ruined my skin, making it dull and textured. So I switched back to this to try it June more time, and my skin reacted negatively instantly.",0.0
"This product is... okay. I am not a huge fan of how dry and tight my skin feels after applying. I totally understand why those who deal with oily skin or like a matte look would love this product.

"First time trying this product and will be my last. I wanted to try it because I’ve seen some great reviews for it, but I honestly don’t know what the hype is about. Partly my fault as I should have realized it’s a balm… so it feels like putting Vaseline on your face. As a person will already oily skin it just feels like I’m not left with a clean face and if anything… more oily. Another thing to note is that it has a terrible smell. Like old lipstick, maybe I just got a bad batch? Maybe I’m just used to more fragrant cleansers, so someone who likes more natural cleansers this may be for them?",0.0

"I LOVE this hyaluronic acid serum. I read an article recently about how you shouldn’t use too much moisturizer because it will weaken your moisture barrier and you should use moisturizers with active ingredients that already occur naturally in your skin — like hyaluronic acid. I have oily/combination skin, and this serum is so hydrating without being heavy. My skin feels so soft and hydrated, and it doesn’t make me more oily at all (because that’s not how hyaluronic acid works, unlike other moisturizers that can clog your pores, break you out, etc. with humectants or other moisturizing ingredients that your skin doesn’t already produce on its own).And it’s SO AFFORDABLE!! Get this serum!!!!!! It sells out all the time so I wish I had stocked up, but I will as soon as it comes back.",1.0

This one is a bit hit or miss. I got this in a sample size from influenster and even though it is lightweight it takes a long time to absorb to skin making it sticky especially if you wear it under make up.

"I love the smell of this toner and love how it doesn’t dry my skin out. However,I didn’t notice much lightening of my dark spots on my face. I probably wouldn’t purchase it again as it didn’t do much for me.*I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.*",0.0

"I was super skeptical trying this as someone with acne prone skin because I had read the great reviews but am never sold until I see things work for myself (I’ve had a lot of hyped up products let me down). Have been using this for a month now. Started off using after the Murad Acne cleanser and a witch hazel toner, and saw no noticeable changes other than skin texture smoothing out for the first week. On week 2 I started breaking out like crazy and had only incorporated this product newly but wasn’t sure that was what was breaking me out entirely, so I stopped using my toner and poof no more breakouts with no other changes to my skincare routine. Upon further research I discovered that my toner contained a grain alcohol and per DE’s website that happens to be one of their “suspicious 6” that are likely to cause breakouts in people. Not sure if I believe 100% all of those 6 cause skin irritation or breakouts but within my own routine I haven’t had anymore breakouts at all after removing products that contain them and this is without using all of the Drunk elephant line together. I feel like this product did more for my skin than just clear it up, it’s made it healthier looking, glowy, and smooth. I don’t even need a pore filling primer anymore for under makeup. I will probably buy this product forever now unless it suddenly stops working it’s magic for me. Highly recommend to anyone with Acne prone skin or Acne scarring!",1.0

"I have oily/combo skin and I have always hated wearing sunscreen because I hated how heavy it felt on my skin. I’ve been looking for a lighter sunscreen for a while now and this is perfect! It’s light, absorbs well into the skin, and is perfect under makeup. The one thing I would say is that if you’re going for a natural glow-y look, this is on the matte side. I know this brand also has a formula that is better for that type of look, but I haven’t tried it.",1.0

"I have used this 3x, maybe 4 since purchasing a week ago. I wanted to wait after more uses assuming I would see results before writing a review, but first impressions are real. So. The first 2x I had two fresh breakouts and did not see a difference the morning after in size or redness reduction. I have noticed I’m oily the next morning when I wake up after use. I have not noticed a change in my complexion or skin texture. I also believe I experienced purging as I have noticed small cluster bumps above my upper lip on the sides (so inner cheeks) and mid forehead. I never breakout on my forehead, so I’m sure this is purging. I purchased the big bottle under the assumption it would work and I would pleased. Kinda wish I got the mini even tho it’s really very tiny. The texture is a semi oil but kinda has a silk feel. I was expecting it to be more fluid like a toner, it definitely is not. I used a cotton round and my fingers to apply on two separate applications and the finger method is better for sure. Also kinda hard to gage how much a few drops is because it’s a squeeze type spout. I wouldn’t use more than twice a week as this is not an exfoliant that gets rinsed away. Not all things work for everyone, so be mindful of expectations because the instant gratification I expected did not happen. While the reviews are good and the Sephora rep told me this is their “best seller”, I’m not seeing where either is true. I’ll likely ride the bottle out because returns are a hassle especially when the store is 1.5 hours from me.",0.0
Love how this isn’t super greasy feeling,1.0
One of the best hydrating primers I’ve ever used! It has such a luxurious texture and leaves a perfect base for makeup without being oily or too much. This is 100% worth the hype.

"I received this as a free sample. It works at visibly minimizing pores after 1 use which was great. It did give a bit of glow and washed off easily. Unfortunately, it caused breakouts for me (whiteheads and red bumps). I was not a fan of the jojoba beads as they felt rough against my sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin, definitely grab a sample before buying.",0.0

Not to mention that I’ve also gotten more tan after one week from using this product, I don’t think the spf was affective enough on my skin. Most sunscreens I’ve used have never caused this so I’m not sure why this one is different. Sad that this product didn’t work for me.",0.0

Ok so I don’t brag on products often but I recently splurged on a skin care product that is typically out of my price range. I mean $34 is a lot to me for a moisturizer! But I’m so glad I did!!!

Im so excited!!,1.0
"A little about me- I’ve been suffering from melasma for almost 5 years. Cause for it is probably birth control pills, not 100% sure. Had melasma when I miscarried 10+ years ago but hydroquinone cleared that up easily. NOTHING, until Vinoperfect, has even made a dent. I’ve used tretinoin, C+E Ferulic, 4% Hydroquinone, kojic acid, diet changes, glycolic acid, Differin gel, dermaroller, face shaving. I got a sample of it from Sephora awhile back and I thought maybe it was helping but I didn’t use it regularly so I wasn’t sure. In November I bought the full size and began using it 1-2 times a day, always in conjunction with The Ordinary’s Vit C powder in the morning and/or Differin gel (and sometimes 10% glycolic acid cream) in the evening. The results? I can tell that it is working!! Mind you, it’s not entirely gone. If it does go away entirely I will update and change to 5 stars (although honestly, this should probably be a 5-star review considering it is the only thing that has helped). Before Vinoperfect, you could definitely see the melasma even after using foundation or concealer — covering it up just made it less obnoxious. Now, you can barely tell it’s there with cover up, maybe not at all. And for the first time in years, I sometimes go without foundation/concealer. It’s there, but it’s definitely lighter and I don’t feel self-conscious like I once did. It’s interesting though- for me, it doesn’t seem like it’s broken up much scarring or freckle-type pigmentation. I get the little shadow scars from acne that doesn’t even break skin. But that’s not what’s bothered me these last few years. It’s the splotchy, uneven tone of melasma that I’ve hated for so long. I never wore foundation before melasma and until Vinoperfect, I tried so many different brands, color correctors, you name it. And now to not have to feel like I’m fighting it every day? I might just change my review to five stars!",1.0

I’m really liking this confidence in a cream moisturizer. It’s different then others and the results are real. There’s no scent and it doesn’t leave any sticky feeling. I’ve been using this everyday for about two weeks. I’ve noticed a decrease in fine lines around my eyes. My skin has smoothed out and has almost a youthful appearance. It’s hydrating and makes my skin soft and vibrant. I’m impressed with this and would recommend to anyone. This goes beyond just being a moisturizer. The actual look of my skin is firmer and overall healthy.,1.0
I’ve been wanting to try this for months and when they had a sale I thought I would get the mini to see if I would like it. I do not. It felt like I was putting crisco on my face.

I have somewhat sensitive skin, but I’ve never had a reaction this bad to a product before (and I use a lot of skincare products). There may have just been something in it that I’m allergic to, but I would definitely recommend patch-testing before slathering it all over your face. I will say the jelly cleanser that came in the set was lovely - no reaction to that and it made my skin feel nice and clean. Sadly this moisturizer just definitely is not for me.",0.0

First, I love the concept of a powder and having to put a few drops of water to activate. The feeling on the skin is amazing! Washing it off, I was surprised how soft my skin was. However, it is very drying, for my skin anyway. I use the Milk Makeup vegan milk moisturizer. Anyone who used it or at least tried it knows how thick that moisturizer is so, a little a little goes a long way. Well, after exfoliating, I had to put another layer of moisturizer because this exfoliator just dried my skin especially my T zone and around my “smile lines“ area.

"There’s absolutely no way this can be used as your only cleanser.  It does not emulsify like other cleansing balms/oils I’ve used in the past. And it doesn’t rinse off at all. It leaves the thickest film on your skin, literally like none of it came off even in the slightest. If you follow it with a gel cleanser, it washes off. But i think it should be able to be rinsed off with water on it’s own. I strongly believe that the only way you should use this cleanser is if it’s a part of a double cleanse. The only things I like about this product is that it doesn’t have essential oils or fragrance (which a lot of balms do). And that fact that it’s in a tube instead of a jar. The texture is nice too, aside from the lack of emulsification and the fact that it doesnt rinse off. All in all, I will not be repurchasing this product.

This is my first review but this product is so great I had to write it !! I have always had a problem with texture on my skin especially on my forehead. I have used other cleansers that were supposed to be great at helping that issue but I would always have he texture as well as visible acne scaring from hormonal acne. I used this cleanser once and saw a noticeable difference with both. I have now used the cleanser for about a week and have never seen my skin so smooth and radiant. Also there is a substantial lessening of my dark spots and scaring. I do use this along with the water cream I purchased around the same time and my skin is so happy with the change. I love this product and the cream and now I can’t wait to try more tatcha !!! I am converted !!,1.0
"I’m going to be completely honest and state that one of the main reasons I am rating this so low is the fact that its price is not remotely proportional to its size. The amount of product is alarmingly small and the pot is made in such a way that even gives the illusion there is more to it than there actually is (see photo). The second reason for my low rating is functionality. As a lip mask it doesn’t offer much more than my $2 tube of Aquaphor offers me. The texture is fine on its own but not super hydrating. It keeps my lips from being too dry the next morning, but overall I wasn’t impressed. Typically when moisturizing your lips you want to add moisture in the form of water or water-based cream and then seal that in with an occlusive like a mask or balm containing petroleum. For some reason the Belif mask becomes waxy if you try to have anything else on your lips underneath it. So, not ideal. Not my favorite lip treatment/balm/mask by far.",0.0

I have never gagged using a skin product, and this made me wretch while spreading it onto my face.While this sunscreen is genuinely transparent, it is definitely not invisible as it is very heavy on the skin and feels greasy, and left the finger with a spot of grease in the first few hours after applying too. I am a lover of thick moisturizers and face oils, and this felt like a bad cooking oil on my face, even with the smell aside - I can’t imagine how this feels for people with other skin types as I have very dry skin and I hate how this is just like a thick unbreathable oil. This actually also made my eyes burn until I gave up on spreading it out & just entirely wiped this off my eye lids. I have used many strong actives on my skin for several years, so I know this is a formula issue and not my skin having a sensitive day. After feeling oily all day I ended up with dehydrated and flaking skin with a few sensitized spots on my cheeks, and washing off this sunscreen again made my eyes burn as I got this off my face completely. I heard a lot of noise about the sunscreen stick online, so I wanted to try out their liquid sunscreens as I expected an extremely well known expensive Japanese brand to have gold standard formulas. But this is one of the 2 worst sunscreen formulas I have used: I tried the other Urban Environment Oil-Free sunscreen by this brand in case I my skin just was not compatible with this thick formula . But that came with a whole different set of issues that made it equally as bad as this one. Won’t touch this brand again!",0.0
"I haven’t noticed a single difference in my skin except that it’s lacking moisture. With exfoliating/ active toners, I like to feel at least a little tingle to let me know that it’s working. No tingle here, only stinky watermelon. My pores look exactly the same. Dries skin out. No change in tone or texture. I’m super bummed with this product. It feels like watermelon goop in a bottle: all about packaging and the “aesthetic“ of the product, and not the actual product itself. About me: I have large pores, blackhead prone. Very fair, dry and sensitive skin.",0.0
Made my skin feel greasy and nasty after removing my makeup,0.0
"I am a really big fan of this cleanser. I don’t necessarily have sensitive skin, but sometimes I do react to stuff but this cleanser was a win! If you’re unsure I would definitely recommend buying the mini version to test it out. The only thing I wish was that it was in a plastic bottle as opposed to glass because I would like to bring it in the shower. I’m afraid it’ll break if I do!",1.0
"I never return anything to Sephora, but I returned this because I could not stand the way this felt on my face. I also ADORE Drunk Elephant products, so this was a major disappointment for me",0.0
"This product is super light and creamy in texture and does a wonderful job at moisturizing and hydrating my eye area. I do get a bit of puffiness around my eyes in the mornings so this has been a nice product to relax the area, but my main concern is dark circles and I don’t think this has helped it at all. For the price, it’s not bad and I probably would repurchase it again for the hydration.",1.0
"Loved this product. Very silky smooth application. Smells great, and a little product goes a long way.",1.0
"I received a trial size from Influenster to try and I have to say, I really like it so far. I generally have oily skin although I have had some isolated dry patches lately, and this does a good job of combatting the oil while also keeping those dry patches looking better under makeup. The only thing I’m a little hesitant about is the smell, but I think that’s just a matter of personal preference.",1.0
This made my skin feel instantly hydrated without it feeling sticky or greasy! After using it the first time I saw instant results! Amazing product. :),1.0
Really wanted to love this product but it drys out my skin. Maybe it works better for oily skin. Love the way it smells though,0.0
Just okay. The cream feels really nice but the smell is overpowering for me. I haven’t noticed any difference in fine lines but have only been using it for about two weeks. It feels nice going on but the smell is definitely a deterrent if you’re skin is sensitive to fragrance.,0.0
I’ve been using the product for a few weeks and I found a new staple to add to my skincare regimen ! It smells amazing and always leaves my face feeling so clean. My face has been super hydrated and this has helped control my breakouts without leaving my face too oily!,1.0
I’ve been using this once a day for two months and even added the essence to my routine about halfway through and it’s done next to nothing for my acne scars.,0.0
I got this two months back and I actually like the rose citrus smell.after applying it it’s does feel good but honestly it doesn’t do much accept giving you that oily glow.,0.0
"I have been using this moisturizer for about 4 to 5 good months now, and it has been breaking me out really bad it has been clogging my pores and give me horrible break out .",0.0
"Smells not dissimilar to a dirty rag. This is my first time ever feeling compelled to write a review noting an unpleasant scent - I’m not usually bothered by various skincare scents. Got this in the mini .5 oz size that came in the House of Gold set. Wanted to love it from peoples reviews, but I won’t be purchasing a full size since I just can’t get over the scent.",0.0
"I really loved this mask! I use it as a sleeping mask a couple times a week and don’t wash it off. I apply it to clean skin and once it’s absorbed I add an oil on top and that’s it. My pores almost feel clogged after using it, but once I wash this off the next morning, I am left with soft, smooth skin that looks more even toned and less red, my pores look minimized and my fine lines look plump. It’s really so good! I definitely recommend giving it a try. I haven’t noticed any breakouts either. I was worried at first because some products with niacinamide do cause me breakouts, but not this one. Yay! A little goes a long way too. I see the small tube lasting me at least a month.",1.0
For the price I would have expected better hydration. It is very sticky so it stays on the lips a while but I have had better results with regular lip balms.,0.0
Not for dry skin. The hyaluronic acid will dry your skin out even more. I had high hopes for this moisturizer because it is light weight but it started drying out my forehead and then peeling happened.,0.0
I think it’s ansolutely great at doing its job and for an excellent price.,1.0
"When it comes to creams and lotion, I can be like “meh, all skincare goodies come from serums, creams just keep it all blanketed in“, so I tend to overlook creams and al of their promises and claims. I just never figured that they could pack a nutritional punch like my beloved serums. But heeellloooo this stuff! I received it as a sample, and figured it wouldn’t hurt to try. I am absolutely floored with thr benefits I have derived since using as a topper to my serums in the PM; my skin hasn’t ever been this hydrated before. The fine lines are diminished, and my skin feels glow all over! I’m buying the full size, and this is getting a top shelf placement on my vanity! ❤️❤️💯💯💯",1.0
"Good cleanser when used in moderation, i use it about once a week and leave it on my face for a couple minutes as a sort of “treatment cleanser.” Good percentage of salicylic acid for acne",1.0
i Really Love This Product It Helps Me With My aDry Skin Especially Before I Put On Makeup.. My Makeup Use To Look All Cakey.. But Ever Since I Started Using This.. ai Seen The Difference..I Recieved The Product Completely Free By Influenster For An Honest Review..,1.0
Love it!!! It is so creamy and smells so good it keeps my lips so hydrated all day long!!!,1.0
"This eye cream comes in cool packaging and is easily dispensed, but overall this did not work for me. I’ve been using this product regularly for a few months now and unfortunately, it increased my milia. I also feel like it does not absorb well into my under eye skin and the dried layer of product would pill off during the day. I haven’t noticed any differences in brightness either. I’ll keep looking for a better eye cream.",0.0
"I am not going to lie, this is super expensive for a Moisturizer BUT I love it. The packaging is super cute, the Moisturizer is so rich and creamy, and it left my skin feeling amazing. My skin is so moisturized and silky smooth. I know not everyone likes fragrance so just warning you that it had a very slight scent to it but it’s very light. I absolutely loved this stuff.",1.0
Caudalie got me addicted to the special edition rose version of this that smelled like a spa in a bottle. I bought this to replace that not thinking anything of it. Well this one also smelled... but like a frat party. Especially fireball cinnamon vodka....bad memories. Anyway this smells like cinnamon powder in a bottle and it’s not pleasant like it is when you make gingerbread men.,0.0
"I don’t know what product other people are using, but I can absolutely say that the scrub I’m using does not smell sweet or natural or like strawberries. It has a very strong medicinal fragrance and is completely off-putting. The scrub itself is gentle and effective, but I rinse like crazy to get the smell off. It’s a shame, because I love strawberries, but I will not be repurchasing.",0.0
"I received this complimentary in a voxbox. I love the concept of the product and how easy it is to understand and use. The packaging is sleek and beautiful. However, after adding this to my skincare routine I have seen no difference in my skin at all. It seems like a waste and not worth using. Big disappointment.",0.0
"I received this complementary for testing purposes.. I LOVE it. It’s gently, works amazing and smells SO good. My skin is soo smooth after using. It has very quickly moved to one of my favorite exfoliators.. 10/10",1.0
feels really thick on my skin and is very greasy. i wouldn’t recommend this product especially since it cost almost $30 for 10 ml,0.0
"This cream is a LIFE SAVER for my acne prone, dry skin. I struggle finding moisturizers that actually do something for my dryness without clogging up my face. With this moisturizer, I use it every morning and night before bed, and I notice SUCH a difference in how my face looks, and feels, and the way make up applies on over it! It has helped reduced the appearance of my smile lines and deep set lines under my eyes. I love that it doesn’t take very much to get the whole face, and the packaging is to DIE for. The only drawback is the slight scent- but it doesn’t bother me nearly enough to make me not enjoy the product. Influenster sent me this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes, but my opinion on this cream is all my own.",1.0
"Overall, this product might do a nice job with hydration... but I truly can’t get past the smell. It smells natural but I just don’t like it.",0.0
"Good product overall, when using it seems like you have to use quite a bit to feel like your face is cleaned. Like the smell and leaves skin soft",1.0
"Does nothing to your skin.literally.cant return it now i guess, i threw the box.waste of money!",0.0
I like this mask but don’t love it. I bought this to make my pores smaller and didn’t really noticed a difference. I did notice that my face was smoother and more radiant after one use though.,1.0
"Amazing! This is my holy grail product. If I could only use one skincare item for the rest of my life it would be this serum. I was having some really bad breakouts on my face, and I swear the first time I used this, my pimples started to clear. It feels amazing, and sinks right into the skin. I love the texture as well. It is thicker than other serums I have tried, almost like a super lightweight gel moisturizer. I love it.",1.0
"I used the whole bottle and I didn’t feel like my skin was smoother, brighter or clearer. It didn’t break me out like I read in some other reviews but it also didn’t do anything great for my skin. There are much better cleansers out there.",0.0
"After two months of use I have not found any significant improvement in fine lines, firmness or brightness. After a month my pump broke, unfortunately and I am stuck with it.",0.0
I have used this product for two weeks and followed directions. I thought I noticed a slight decrease in pore size. My issue with this brand is the price.,0.0
I think this product is amazing ! MY HUSBAND even loves this product and that means soooo much ! It literally kisses your skin in all the right places and you can SEE how clean your skin is afterwards ! Definitely will be buying again !,1.0
love this but don’t get it near your eyes or else you’ll go blind for 30 minutes,1.0
"Awesome, thick undereye cream that is never greasy?!?!  Leave it to Kiehl’s, who I’m glad can now be found at Sephora these days.  I have every undereye issue: very puffy, some darkness, and now nearing 50 yrs old so seeing some fine lines.  This cream has been one of the best remedies, and even works perfectly under makeup.",1.0
"This is a decent facial exfoliant, I didn’t notice any major difference in my skin but it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I don’t think this is something I would use again in the future. This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review.",0.0
"Almost $50 for face wash that smells like dish soap is a bit much. It’s not too harsh or anything but I don’t know why it’s so popular on YouTube. I like how it came with a pump and a separate lid which is ideal for moving/travel (only the large size does, small one doesn’t). I wouldn’t buy this again though.",0.0
I received this free from Influenster. I was super excited to try it. I didn’t notice any difference over the 3 week period I’ve used it. But I love the bottle and the pour spout. I just feel like this is normal water and didn’t have amazing results like everyone else.,0.0
"I received a deluxe size sample of this with one of my Sephora orders, and I was pleasantly surprised. If you are already a seasoned retinol user, this isn’t going to blow you away. But if you’re just getting your skin used to this type of product, I think Luna is a good choice.I already have my One True Retinol, and it’s not this one, but I liked rotating this in during the winter when my skin was brutally dry. The oil base really agreed with me during that season of dry indoor heat and zero outdoor humidity. I got some overall texture reduction, but not as much as I get with other retinols. To be honest, I’d probably give Luna a 3.5 star rating, if such a thing were possible? In summary, if you’re young, super dry-skinned, and/or just getting into retinol products, Luna is a nice option.",1.0
"I picked this up from Sephora after not being able to pick up the HA from The Inkey List and this did the trick! I have combo-oily skin so HA is necessary to keep my skin hydrated without being greasy or oily. The only thing I don’t like about this product is the dropper - The Ordinary’s HA formula is fairly liquidy so the dropper doesn’t do a great job at transferring product from the bottle to your hands without dripping on the outside of the bottle. Other than that, I recommend this to anyone who is in need of an affordable HA.",1.0
My skin is glowing! After just one use my skin felt firmer  and looked brighter. Super easy to use. Definitely buying again,1.0
"First of all I love that the dropper is angled so you can get that last bit of product! This serum does everything it claims to, i would 100% try this out if you suffer from dark spots (post acne)",1.0
"Such a gorgeous product. I live for this products. It absolutely saves my skin. Typically, I wear use this products whenever I feel my skin needs some extra love. But, it is beautiful under makeup. I would definitely recommend this product. Also, I find the packaging is super easy to travel with.",1.0
Hello! I received the jet lag mask as a gift and I’m so excited about this product I was really shocked that it was full size products it really worked well with my skin type I have combination skin it reduce redness and had all day hydrating formula is amazing made my face feel so fresh and clean and it tightened infirmed as well this vegan formula so lightweight and fragrance-free I highly suggest it to anyone,1.0
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. It worked well as an exfoliant, but my skin is super sensitive so I had a few breakouts afterward. I think it was due to the fragrance. I thought it was going to smell like pineapple, but it smelled like a grandmothers perfume. I did like that my skin didn’t feel tight or raw after using it.",1.0
"The product is okay. I love the idea of a sunscreen, moisturizer, and color corrector in one. The product might be slightly too moisturizing for my combination skin. I am experiencing slight breakouts, but nothing too major. Also, it leaves a green tinge. I don’t think others can notice, but it bugs me! I will finish it since I use this on days when I don’t apply makeup since it is convenient, but may not repurchase.",0.0
May work for others but not me. Love the consistency and the way it sinks into the skin but this broke me out right under my eyes and so did their original eye cream. There’s just something in them that my skin doesn’t agree with. I have dry/sensitive skin.,0.0
"Love the light weight feel, the smell and the glow of this product.",1.0
"I used this product all winter, and all winter I suffered from dry, flaky skin. Now, granted, I did start using tretinoin in the fall, so I know that has contributed to the dryness. However, this product really didn’t do anything to ease that dryness either, which is surprising to me. This moisturizer has oils and ceramides in it, which are great moisturizing ingredients; yet, it doesn’t even last through the night on my skin. I wake up in the morning with my skin feeling dry and tight. For a long time I refused to believe this moisturizer was playing a role in the state of my skin, but when I switched to a different one, my skin started to look and feel better. If your skin is normal, or if you’re not using any actives, this product might be fine to use. For me, though, who’s looking for some actual repair and moisture, this just doesn’t do anything.",0.0
"I love this product. Feels exfoliating but not rough, gentle enough for daily use. Smells incredible but natural. Noticeable difference with daily use. However the packaging absolutely must be changed. Tatcha, you are one of my favorite brands but I specifically haven’t repurchased this product (which I would do forever) because the packaging is such trash.",0.0
"Pros: Great for all skin types, including sensitive. Pineapple & papaya (top AHA/ BHA) designed to reveal glowing, more youthful skin by removing the top layer of the skin..This is more of a gommage gel. Unlike traditional scrubs this gel lifts away dead skin as it is moved/rolled around the skin.Cons: If you have pineapple or certain enzyme allergies",1.0
I am only giving it a 1 star because I clearly did not read what texture form this moisturizer is. Putting it on my face felt like water and I could not tell if it was absorbing or not.... I bought this product due to the overwhelming reviews and it just did not hit my sweet spot.  I ended up giving this product to my mother. I am in my 30’s with combination skin and what I have learned isI like a creamy moisturizer and this felt like a gel and cream mixed together; very light and fluffy.  I love PTR just not this!,0.0
"This gifted to me product was a godsend to my poor skin. My face is extremely acne prone and stays flared up. This has helped calm it down tremendously. Leaves my face feeling clean, smooth and revigorated. I highly recommend this",1.0
"I bought the value size, and although this product is pretty expensive it is worth the money. Makes my skin instantly plump and even toned.",1.0
Another gem from glow recipe! This is one of my favorite toner now!! I love the smell and how it feels on my skin… it made my face clearer and my skin is looking brighter and smoother after using it for few days! It works great on my pores ! I definitely recommend this to everyone,1.0
"I decided to try this 3 weeks before writing a review.  This did absolutely nothing for my blackheads or whiteheads. When you remove strips, you can clearly see they are just wet from keeping them on at night. I even tried them during the day time for 6 hours in case I slept on them, but nope. It just strips oil off your face.",0.0
"Looooving this! It has Niacinimide, which has been such a hit this year. Not sure if I can tell that there are any drastic changes to my skin yet but it feels nice when applied.",1.0
"Amazing sun protection, great as a base for makeup, overall a solid product that I will be using every day.",1.0
"I tried this moisturizer a few days this week. First thoughts were it felt creamy and cool to the touch and felt very smooth and moisturizing as I applied to my skin. Initially, my skin looked very supple and moisturized; however, I found the product evaporates off and the moisture is not long lasting. I like the idea of the lightweight gel-cream formula and texture; however, it is not meant for naturally dry skin. I think this is best suited for naturally oily skin or to be paired with an oil so the moisture stays in the skin.",0.0
"Works ok, I like the laniege better. Also came like half empty",0.0
"Really wanted to like this product as I enjoy many of RENs other products, HOWEVER, I would like to add/confirm, as a few other reviews out there have stated, this toner made me 1) so sticky and 2) made my skin red and flushed for the remainder of the day. Because I have slightly sensitive skin I did try to narrow my usage down to once a day but ultimately could not get over the sticky feeling the product left on my skin. Returned.",0.0
I bought the Color Correcting Treatment as part of the Magical Skin Potions set. I have moderately pink oily skin. I honestly don’t get the hype of this product. It is way too thick and oily feeling for me plus it does absolutely nothing to cover up my redness. I sincerely wish it did everything other reviewers have claimed it does...I would be thrilled.,0.0
Disappointed with this moisturizer- got a sample as my birthday gift. It was alright but I found that drugstore creams were comparable to this and at a much better price. The label on my sample jar also came off when I traveled with it which was annoying because the black specks ended up in the moisturizer. Started breaking out after a couple uses so I stopped using it. Overall would not recommend this.,0.0
I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. It’s an excellent product right down to the scent and the amount of hydration it applied to my skin. I found that I required minimal product and the applicator and bottle is designed well. No spillage. The 15 ml size is a suitable size for someone trying out the product for the first time.,1.0
"I’ve used Exfolikate for years because it is just that good!! I always see improvement in my skin texture after a single use. For how effective it is, it’s fairly gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s pricey but it’s definitely worth it!",1.0
Have been mostly resistant to masks because i worry about them getting all over my pillow. This one is so light weight and actually didn’t transfer onto my sheets when i slept with it. i got in the shower to discover the smoothest  i’ve ever felt my face. i look forward to using this a few nights a week. the effects seem to last several days.,1.0
"Tried the mini pack they have. It does have a noticeable scent, however this didnt bother me. I just didnt feel a difference and certainly wouldnt buy it for almost 60$ alone. Ive been testing out this product since like february so its been part of my routine for a while. Was hoping for a better result.",0.0
:( didn’t do a thing but I’m glad it worked for others,0.0
"I love this product! I have constantly chapped/dry lips, but this product keeps my lips soft and plump throughout the day. My lips haven’t been chapped since. I apply it on as if it’s lip balm and use it to prep my lips for liquid lipsticks. I also sometimes apply it on top of my lip color to add some shine/gloss. It comes with a cute and tiny spatula. Def worth the money.",1.0
"This is my all time favorite makeup remover. It removes everything- including my mascara and doesn’t leave an oily residue once I rinse it off. I don’t have problems with my cleanser not foaming up after I use this balm, as I do with most oil based removers. And a tub lasts a very long time.",1.0
"I had a horrible effect with this product, it started some kind of acne rosacea, never had it before.  I applied this product to my chin, and that’s were all the pimple came in, at once, I’m on antibiotics, and cream regimen, it’s a nightmare, because it started to spread.",0.0
"I bought this after getting it in a beauty box because I really liked the green color toning down my red skin. But after buying a full size, I noticed that it tended to make my skin look more dry, dull, and weirdly flaky. I love Dr Jart+’s ther Cicapair products especially their cream, and I adore the Ceramidin line, but this ended up being a dud. I now use a Sephora x Pantone color correcting palette on top of Ceramidin when I want to address red tones and it overall works a lot better.",0.0
"It’s okay.  They aptly named it the Butter cleanser as it is very difficult to remove and even after my double cleanse I feel as though my face is still greasy.  It doesn’t remove makeup that well either.  The best thing about it is that it doesn’t burn the eyes at all which is something that I’ve been looking for in an oil cleanser but this just doesn’t fit the bill either.  Also, I’m not a fan of the packaging..... magnetic spoon on the top seems cool but in actuality I don’t think this product could really stay sanitary.",0.0
"Love the smell, not impressed with the product (considering the price). Have not noticed a difference on my skin after using the product about 5/6 months, and gas caused lots of breakouts.",0.0
Love how this melts into your skin.  Great at taking everything off.  I follow up with micellar water to remove.,1.0
"Nice texture but the fragrance is way too strong for me. I understand that Lancôme has always used perfume in their products, but you can’t really have an “anti-stress” product when you’re adding in components (like perfume) that stress out your skin. I would not recommend - there are more affordable and less irritated products out there. I received this product free in exchange for a review.",0.0
This product is amazing! I wake up every morning with glowing skin. Leaves my skin super hydrated,1.0
"This product is most effective when you use it as soon as you feel a pimple coming in. It’s able to pretty much stop it in its tracks. If you use it on pimples that have already emerged I’ve found that it kind of expedites the life cycle of the pimple. So it will be there, but goes away a lot faster using the spot remover.",1.0
I received this cream as a sample so it is hard for me to speak about the long term effects on my wrinkles. Using it I did notice my skin was smooth. But I was not very impressed with the level of hydration through the day. It is a fine cream but I am not sure it would replace the cream I currently use.,0.0
Didn’t do much for me; no reduction in either size or redness.,0.0
"I received this product for free from Influenster to test and give an honest review. Between the Moisturizing Bomb and the Aqua Bomb I prefer the Aqua Bomb. I have dry skin so I’m always looking to hydrate. This product maybe gives me hydration for an hour but it dries up quicker than I would like, leaving my feeling dry again. It’s an okay product, but it doesn’t last enough for me and my skin type.",0.0

"I really wanted to like this, I like the branding and was looking for a less expensive alternative to my YTTP air whip moisturizer, I wash my face twice a day and wanted something else to alternate it with. It smells strongly of alcohol and it made my skin get oily really fast (I have naturally oily skin), it also made me break out. I probably won’t try anything else from this brand since I didn’t like the face wash either.",0.0
"LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It’s very expensive, indeed, but it’s an amazing product. It saved my skin while I was on Accutane. I’ve been using it since 4 years now, and I would recommended it to everyone. I use the Crème de la Mer during Fall and Winter season, and I use the Soft La Mer during Spring and Summer season. A size 2oz can last me about 8-9 months, using it twice a day.",1.0
"Too thick, too heavy - wouldn’t even pat into my skin.",0.0
Bought this while traveling to Paris. It did not absorb well since sort of sat uncomfortably on my face with little benefits. Got a few tiny zits from it and I have Dry-Combo skin. Too expensive.,0.0
"Not for me. I saw all the great reviews for this serum and since I have acne and oily prone skin, I needed to try it! Once I did, I noticed I started getting acne in place I’ve never gotten it before like my neck. Not sure if it was purging or my skin had some bad reaction to it, but not willing to take a chance. This was a waste of money for me. Hopefully it helps out other people but this was my personal experience with the Caudalie serum.",0.0
This product is amazing!!!! I use to have a lot of dead skin and blackheads on my noes and this definitely helped.,1.0
I’m assuming the formula was changed based off the texture of this and the condition my face was left in after using. I had used probably 4 different samples of this that I kept getting along with other purchases. it previously was very thick and smooth but when I bought the full size it was sticky and absorbed much quicker than the samples I had. once I used it a couple of days I realized my face was a lot redder than before and all my pores have been clogged. it doesn’t take much for my skin to get red but with it being a product that’s supposed to help with redness it was extremely disappointing. My pores do not get clogged easily so this was very surprising. I usually use the tiger grass treatment with spf for everyday redness reducing but after such bad reactions to this product that seemed to change over night I no longer trust dr jart + to continue to buy their products. I purchased the kiehls cica cream after reading other reviews on this change and it’s already made my skin feel more comfortable and less red in one use.,0.0
I was gifted by Octoly x Goop. I have been using this product for over a week and immediately after the first use my skin looked brighter! Love the scent and texture. It is very gentle on the skin! Loved it! I would def recommend!,1.0
Dries my lips out and makes them flaky. Does not help and hydrate lips. I would not buy again,0.0
"Complementary from influenster. I was happy to try this product out the past two weeks, once a day. It is the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum•I used this everyday in the morning. It sat well under makeup and it’s packed with hyaluronic acid so if you live an a humid environment and you have dehydrated and dry skin this will be so special for you. It was almost too hydrating for me at times but if you’re really dry and dehydrated this is ideal. If you don’t live in an environment with moisture in the air the hyaluronic acid in this product can actually do more bad than good and dehydrate your skin even more.•I see no anti-aging affects but I do think you will notice a more youthful look to your skin when using this because it’s meant to add hydration to your skin that you may be missing which “plumps” your skin.•I do think as I get older this is a product I’ll have to keep in mind as my skin changes and doesn’t hold as much water and hydration in the skin as easy. It is expensive but it think the results can be worth it for your skincare routine",0.0
I read a review that described the product as “simply sitting on your face“ and that’s exactly how I would describe it. It’s not magical by any means and is not as hydrating as other cheaper hydrating masks I’ve tried. I would skip this and go for another mask with better reviews.,0.0
Had an immediate skin irritation under my eyes. Horrible product,0.0
"While I like the way it feels, love that it’s clear and it did protect as advertised, I have a HORRIBLE breakout from it.  Despite claiming to be unscented, it smells funny as well.",0.0
I was really excited about Sephora brought on this line as I heard good reviews - but to be honest I’ve found most of their products bead up on my skin and react oddly with each other even though I followed the advice outlined on the bottle,0.0
"Get The Ordinary one instead, I highly recommend that one but not this. Didn’t like my skin’s feeling after using this one.",0.0
"My FAVORITE moisturizer hands down!!!  I have acne prone skin and this didn’t irritate my skin, extremely light weight, gentle on the skin, skin absorbs it immediately, and has a subtle pleasant scent. Definitely recommend!!!",1.0
I had high hopes for this product because it had great reviews but it doesn’t do what it advertises. Very disappointing - doesn’t even hydrate or smooth the skin after few months of use morning and night.,0.0
"I like the non greasy feel it leaves for my t-zone, but is not moisturizing enough for the drier areas of my face, and I would prefer something heavier for night. Great scent.",1.0
"I’m leaving 1 star just because I like the texture of this cleanser. However, contains too many citric oils that are NOT suitable for sensitive skin. After one application my sensitive skin felt tight and was very red! Yes, it was squeaky cleaned afterwards but it does not worth the redness and irritation.",0.0
"TRASH PRODUCT - Do not buy, it’s just another overpriced serum that does absolutely nothing but make you looks oily. It feels insignificant and watery in application yet there is little to no absorption. Additionally the pump is a bit aggressive. I had to use THREE pumps to cover my entire face.",0.0
This cleanser has done nothing to clear or prevent breakouts on my face. Still get them on a weekly basis even though I wash my face with this stuff daily.,0.0
"I love this face wash. My face feels squeaky clean after use.

"The product really makes me skin so soft and really nourishes it, but the smell is so unbearable and I’ve been trying to get past it but I literally can’t it’s so bad.",0.0
"I’m surprised this has the reviews it does. Let’s start with the positive. The only one I can think of is it smells really nice. But as far as taking off makeup, I always have to clean my face again after using this. It does nothing for mascara but smudges it all over my face and it slightly blinds me when I use it on my eyes. My vision is usually blurry for about 30 seconds. This is concerning to say the least. I would say get a nice cleanser instead since you’ll need to wash your face again anyways to remove your makeup.",0.0
"It’s just okay, I was still breaking out with this drying my skin out. Also the pump is terrible after one use it was leaking all over my counter... i even tried pumping what’s left in the pump back into the bottle and it still forced the product up and out of the bottle..best thing to do is not use the pump bc it probably wasted more than I actually used. I switched to dermalogica clearing skin wash and my skin has been break out free ever since. The best thing about this skin cleanser is the smell.",0.0
Ehhh did not do anything for my skin. So expensive for no reason. I would not purchase again- ended up giving it to my mom and she did not like it either. Smells funny and made me break out here and there. Gave me little white bumps all over my cheeks and chin. Tried to like it but just couldn’t.,0.0
"It’s a good face cream and does it’s job without being too heavy, especially under make-up. I like it as a light daytime moisturizer on top of the PTR Water Drench Serum. Although this product is fine, I can’t give it 5 stars because it isn’t really any exceptional compared to all the HA hydrators available now.",1.0

"I originally bought this because I needed a travel cleanser for my trip to Hawaii, now that my plans have been delayed due to sheltering in place I have tested out the product at home. I must say, I am pleasantly surprised with the results of this cleanser. I’m not a huge fan of oil cleansers but have heard good things about this brand so I figured I would give it a go. I now am contemplating on buying the full size cleanser because I am really enjoying how my skin feels during and after cleansing. It doesn’t have a potent smell and no oily residue after cleansing. I have combo skin and this gives me the oomph I need to get my day started! =)",1.0
This product is nice! It rubs out very evenly on the face and doesn’t stay white. My only complaint is that is was a little too hydrating for my skin type. I’m eternally shiny/acne prone so I probably will not repurchase,1.0
"I received this product as a free sample. In my opinion the fact that it has a highbred product is a great concept, however for my skin type it doesn’t work that way. It is a great toner, however not enough moisture from my skin.",0.0

Don’t fall for the hype! Completely useless on my skin,0.0
"I love the glow it gives, but the product just sits on my skin and pills. It doesn’t matter if I use it by itself, with other products, or even a little. Also wore this to the beach and stayed out for less then 2 hours and I still got burnt. My father in-law who knows nothing about makeup said my face was so shiny that I was blinding him. Guess it puts a new meaning to blinding people hana.",0.0
I love this so much! I’ve been using it every night for the past two weeks and I’ve noticed a great difference. The skin around my eyes is brighter and the discoloration I had on my eyelids has greatly reduced. My under-eyes are so much more hydrated and the little lines I had are less visible. I love this product so much and couldn’t recommend it enough!,1.0
I’ve been using this for months trying to make myself love it but...this product misses the mark. It all but doesn’t emulsify. In fact when I add water I find that it makes it harder to wash off as the water just rolls off my face. It emulsifies a bit better if I use hot water BUT that is TERRIBLE for skin. It also is notorious for leaving makeup behind. This works better using a washcloth to remove..but that defeats a good balm in my mind.,0.0
"For how many amazing reviews this product has, it’s been just fine for my skin. Nothing amazing, not terrible. I think my skin likes something a bit more hydrating - I’d consider this product super lightweight and maybe better suited for more oily skin types. I switched over to Dr. Haushka and have noticed a big difference with that brand for morning moisturizer.",0.0
"Best cleanser I have ever tried. I have been using it for years and it’s so good I never even have a desire to try another product! I used to have severe cystic acne and took Accutane. While the cleanser did not help reduce acne, it is incredibly hydrating and doesn’t dry out/tighten my skin like other cleansers (so it was wonderful to use with Accutane which causes dry skin). Four years later and completely acne free, I still use the product and love how soothing and gentle it feels.",1.0
Not for my face little sticky and gave me a pimple after using a second time with Vitamin C and caffein from youth people something like that name.The smell is good in the beginning then it is too much I didn’t like it.,0.0
I received a sample of this cleanser complimentary as part of my #bossbabevoxbox from Influenster and I liked it but I wasn’t completely blown away.It felt nice but not life changing and my skin didn’t feel super hydrated after. I prefer a cleanser that leaves skin feeling clean but plump. The creamy foam is nice but that was about it.,0.0
"The only moisturizer that works for my dry sensitive skin! I absolutely love it. It’s a little bit too heavy to use during the hot season , so i only use a small amount.",1.0
"This product is high quality. The container is thick and sturdy, and comes with a seal to keep the product fresh. The cream is white, thick, and has a very mild scent. Applying this to my skin gave it a cooling and refreshing effect and it felt really nice. I think I would use this at night time to get the best results from it.",1.0
Love it! I first received this product as a sample in the original but I looked this smell and decided to purchase it. It leaves my lips so soft and doesn’t leave a gross sticky residue when I wake up.,1.0
"I’m really happy with this product. I initially bought this product because I thought that it would help me get off my make up faster after a long night out without a lot of effort as with cleansers I would need micellar water to get off my sub on mascara. However, This product became a blessing in disguise as I found it really helpful for my eczema prone skin.I was also hesitant of purchasing this product as it is on the cheaper side and I thought that the quality would not be as good as compared to more expensive products. But luckily, I was proven wrong by this cleansing balm. It’s affordable and the quality is great. I am already on my second bottle of this and will be re-purchasing this as long as the product is available. It doesn’t strip my skin of it’s natural oils and I like to use this as a face mask sometimes too. It helps calm my eczema patches on my face. I have already recommended this to a lot of my friends. I’m not sure how it would work with someone with oily skin, but i would recommend this to anyone who has extremely dry, combination, or normal skin types as a make up remover and face wash/mask.",1.0
Usually love anything by this brand and this is no exception! Love how it turns to pink and great for sensitive skin !,1.0
"Omg, this stuff is amazing. I received a sample of it and had never heard of it before. I had no expectations but wow. I bought it right after the first try. It makes your skin so smooth and your pores disappear. Honestly one of the best skin care items I’ve tried.",1.0
"Unfortunately I haven’t had the same experience as other users, and have found this product to be incredibly drying.",0.0
I don’t really get exfoliating from this product. It might be so gentle that it isn’t quite as exfoliating as I personally need. I also really hate this packaging. The bottle is weirdly difficult to get product out of. I also feel like my skin feels a bit dry after use. I generally love the Tatcha products but this was a miss for me.,0.0
"While my skin is always dry, my nose tends to get oily and I’ve noticed an increase in pore size lately. After recommendations from a couple of people, I decided to try this on a whim and I’ve fallen in love with this simple serum. Not only is application quick and easy, but I noticed a difference the very first day. After a couple of weeks of use, I can see a difference in my pore size and my nose is noticeably less oily. My skin also seems more even in tone and texture. Any breakouts or singular pimples have been much smaller, less irritated and red, and have gone away much faster than usual. I’m in disbelief that I’ve gotten so much from such a simple, inexpensive product. This has been a miracle for my skin and is a must-have for everyone. Please sell this in stores and in larger sizes!",1.0

"I received this product for free from Influenster to test it out. This was an okay product for me. It didn’t have a strong scent and had a nice light texture but I didn’t notice much difference with my skin. Either the product wasn’t suitable for me or I needed more product and time to test it out longer. I didn’t notice breakouts or irritation with this but everything is ymmv so if this looks like something you want to try, check the ingredients first.",0.0
"I dont see the magic from this cream but it does give a little glow to my skin so im thinking this like Bobbi Brown base cream. The texture,consistency and the smell just like Lamer and Vaseline in blue tin. 2 stars for the packaging,i just love how they wrapped the box and the jar is very nice.",0.0
I’ve heard a lot of good reviews about this product so I had to try it out! And let me tell you it did not disappoint. My skin was glowing after a week of use and I definitely see fine lines fading. My skin is plumper and the clarity is amazing. Complimentary from Sunday Riley.,1.0
"This is by far one of my favourite Tatcha products and cleansers. The Luffa fruit lightly exfoliates and cleanses without irritating or damaging my skin. I use it twice a day, and it has done wonders! It also has a beautiful smell — well worth the price.",1.0
This is a rich and creamy face base that also contains vitamin c and e and shea butter. I was afraid it would be too heavy on my skin but I enjoy face bases that have skincare benefits to it. It has been super dry this winter so I thought this might be a nice hydrating base as my skin dries throughout the day esp the nose area.Applied after skincare with only light moisturizer and had no issues. It is quite a thick texture but doesnt feel greasy or heavy on my skin but i kept application light too as shea butter breaks me out if too much. Kept my skin hydrated throughout the day. It is a tacky enough so foundation sticks to it. Not bad,1.0
"Estée Lauder’s new Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream is love at first use for me in the new year. Immediately nourishing, this has ingredients my skin enjoys, such as Moringa Plant Extract. I could actually see a change within the first week. It leaves behind a soft, satiny, hydrated feel. My skin looks balanced and now my makeup foundation glides across my face. Best of all, I don’t get to mid-day sensing that I need a top up of anything further. I really believe a quality moisturizer should give you the satisfaction of feeling that you are using a product which is simple and effective. I was kindly gifted this product and I’ve used it as my daytime moisturizer every day since…and now I purchased a jar myself because it’s that good!",1.0

"This product is one of my favorites. Leaves my skin really soft, smells good and it’s not greasy. I love it more with the new ingredients it makes it work even faster in your skin.

I got this free from glow recipe. I really like this moisturizer. It gave my skin a plump feeling and a bright look. I did have a bit of an issue with it mixing with other things in my routine but i would still buy,1.0
I received this product for testing purposes and I was not a fan. I didn’t notice a difference in my skin at all. I wasn’t a fan of the smell either. I have very problematic skin and I don’t typically use serums and I definitely wouldn’t purchase this one.,0.0
This lip balm does not moisturize at all in fact it dried them out.,0.0
"The only moisturizer I’d spend $68 on. It saved me from the horrors that come with the first 8 weeks of Adapalene. It lasted me just under 3 months and it’s the first/last time I’ll ever (foolishly) run out before restocking. Love this moisturizer, love this brand!",1.0

"I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and I really wanted to love this moisturizer because a lot of the typical gel formulations don’t hydrate enough when my surface dryness is flaring up.

I may be able to continue with it more sporadically rather than every night, but I’m a bit disappointed.",0.0
"I had been looking for an eye cream for several years and I finally love this one. First, I will say that I don’t love the packaging due to having to stick my finger in a very small jar, but it won’t influence future repurchases because I love this. I’m on my second jar as I love the hydration, texture, and results. My eyes are significantly hydrated after each use and when applying makeup, my under eyes don’t look dry and crepey like they used to. This product comes out like a thick cream but melts in very nicely so that you do not need to tug at your eyes; definitely lives up to the name. I have also noticed that my under eyes are noticeably brighter than they have been in the past. I don’t think my eye area has ever been so hydrated and bright. Will continue to repurchase!",1.0
thought this would be great for my no makeup days since it contains SPF and color corrects the redness. I have been using it for a while now and it leaves a greasy finish and white cast which is a big no for me since I prefer a matte finish and the white cast give me an ashy appearance.,0.0

"I mean, it’s fine. It’s hyaluronic acid, but just an average serum. I’d say it performs the same as a $10-$25 serum. But the pump on this thing? The absolute worst. I’m not even halfway through the bottle, and I have to hold the bottle juuuuuuuust right to pump any amount of product out.",0.0

"I received the Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery Oil free from Influencer to test. First off, it smells beautiful. The scent is by far my favourite thing about it! I don’t get the hype about the product otherwise. I’ve been using it morning and evening for almost two weeks now, and I haven’t noticed any difference in my (almost 40 year old) skin. It recommends using 2-3 drops, and rubbing them in your hands before applying, but I’ve found it absorbs so quickly that there’s very little to put on my face. And what is there isn’t a great texture for “massaging in to the skin”, as there’s very little slipperiness to it. I wouldn’t purchase it for myself.",0.0
"This cream did nothing for my wintery dry skin.  It did not absorb and laid on top of the skin.  Also made my skin slightly red.  If you are “trying to restore your moisture barrier“ I suggest you try something else.  For a $50 cream, I used this up in less than a month and had zero benefits come from it.",0.0
"I used this product for one week and did not see a dramatic change in my skin. I have dry to normal skin and I applied this product after my cleansing as part of my nightly routine.

If I had used the product longer I may have seen some results.",0.0
This is a great hydrating serum I received from Trendmood Box.  Love it for my dry skin!!,1.0

This moisturizer does not break me out and feels great on the skin but I feel that this would benefit someone with very oily skin as it did not deliver the moisture I need. (My skin is combo and can be more dry/oily depending on the season),1.0
"This and the salicylic acid treatment - used in conjunction - have transformed my sensitive, dry, dull skin. Before I started using these, I had to manually exfoliate every second day, or else foundation would gather in my dry spots, and just look terrible. That caused my skin to be more sensitive, and get drier over time. I’d get hormonal acne sometimes, probably caused by dead skin cells blocking pores, because this stuff stopped that almost completely. If you have potentially sensitive skin, I’d recommend using lactic acid first, twice per week, and increase (and add in salicylic acid) if you have no negative side effects - dryness, irritation, etc. Your tolerance may allow you to use them every night. Again, use this only at night, because it can cause increased photosensitivity. Also, you can apply lactic acid and salicylic acid at the same time - but since they both require a pH between 3-4 to remain active, use them as your first step in your nighttime routine, and let them sit for at least 20 minutes before applying anything else. This will give them ample time to do their job before you dilute them and raise the pH out of the effective range.",1.0
"I had never heard of SK-II before I was chosen by Influenster and Sephora to review this product. I was very excited once I learned that it is a high end facial product. I thought surely that since this product is so expensive, it was going to improve my skin. Aging is something I worry about since I’m over the age of 40. But after more than a month of using this product, I see no noticeable difference in my skin. For positives, I can say that this product did not irritate my skin, and I have very sensitive skin. I also found the lack of scent to be nice, because I am also very sensitive to fragrances. It also was not sticky, and sunk into my skin quickly. Despite these positives, I could not justify spending so much money on a product that did not seem to deliver results. Another thing I’d like to mention is the packaging. I am always seeking out products that use less plastic and more environmentally friendly packaging. I would love to see more brands such as this one, make the switch to more environmentally friendly packaging. Additionally, SK-II is not cruelty free. They test their products on animals. I prefer cruelty free products.",0.0
"I have only been using this cleanser for 3 days along with the Tatcha Rice Enzyme Cleanser that I incorporated into my routine at the same time, and the results are INSANE. My skin legit feels like a baby’s bottom, and that is NOT an exaggeration. I usually have lots of texture from past acne and all of that texture has gone away instantly. Everyone in my household has been complementing me on my skin, and I finally feel confident enough to go completely makeup free now. Love love love this product. and I highly recommend it for everyone. I am oily and very very sensitive and this product has not cause any irritation, breakouts, or increased oiliness. GOLD. I was always on the fence about buying this product because of the price point, but I finally caved and I am so happy that I did. All Tatcha products are a smash in my book.",1.0

The Luna Night Oil made me break out so horrifically and worse than I ever have in my life. I don’t have sensitive skin and this ruined me. I highly do not recommend.

I will come back and update this review at the end of the month. Use them day and night and HONESTLY a little goes a long way! It’s so creamy and not runny like other eye creams. It smells great!

"This has definitely helped significantly with my oiliness, I no longer wake up in the mornings looking greasy!

"There are more cosmetically elegant sunscreens on the market for less than what this costs. I don’t understand why, but the formula comes out of the tube looking like it just wasn’t blended together enough. It goes on like white paint and parts of the formula separate and gum together on my skin in small pieces. It’s itchy and looks disgusting. My skin is in very good condition, and I’ve tried this product over other products within the brand and outside the brand. I’ve used every moisturizing product under the sun to make this work, because I can’t return it and it’s quit a lot of product to just throw away. I give up. I don’t recommend this sunscreen to anyone and I will not be repurchasing. Sad because the brand itself seems like one I’d like to support.",0.0

Did not like this product. Dried me out and caused my skin to develop bumps. Not good for dry skin.,0.0
This was definitely the right color for me. I have fair skin with red undertones. I use this every other night and it helps give my face a glow without being orange or too much. I did find that everyday use was TOO MUCH.,1.0
Highly recommend this cream especially in the winter months. It keeps your skin soft and supple for many hours. It has amazing ingredients and my skin has never felt healthier and hydrated. I have dry skin so I am always looking for creams that moisturize your skin without looking oily and without drying out too soon. This fits the bill for both those criteria.,1.0

"A little goes a long way when using this cream. Agreement self is thick and luxurious, without being too heavy. It is lightly scented and feels nice on your skin. It absorbs quickly. As I get older, I am finding that the fine lines and wrinkles are more apparent on my face. Using this cream under and around my eyes and around my mouth has made a difference. My skin is stronger and appears more hydrated. I really like the way that it feels. It does not take a lot of this cream to cover your face and neck. I will buy this again because it does last a long time. I was given a sample sized bottle to try and exchange for my honest review.",1.0
This product was gifted by Skinfix in exchange for my honest review. I think I’m in love. This moisturizer is incredible. The packaging keeps out air so that it will stay good for longer. The product itself is beautifully moisturizing and perfect for pairing with the retinol I use. 10/10 product!,1.0
"I’ve bought this product two times now(small one and then the bigger one) because I didn’t know a lot about moisturizers and I trusted the Ordinary. I won’t lie this product can be good if you don’t want to look oily or feel a heavy cream on your face. Other than that I don’t feel anything else. It’s like you’re putting on a cream that disappears after a while. You don’t feel much except for when you first apply and it’s pretty hard to apply too. It can even feel drying, so I constantly feel like I need to apply more during the day. I still use it but I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing after I finish :/",0.0

"Got this from a friend who suggested it to me. I have sensitive skin and this caused me to breakout wherever I applied this(mainly my jawline). It also doesn’t smell the best, but had it helped my skin I probably would’ve gotten over that. Would not recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.",0.0
This is my new favourite item for my night routine. I’m a relatively lazy person and the fewer steps the better. I am in LOVE with this product. I use it at night time after washing my face. Being lazy sometimes it is just this or I follow up with the a moisturizer. My skin glows. I used to have a bunch of red patches on both sides of my cheeks and those have dramatically decreased. It is great as a gentle exfoiliant and definitely promotes skin turn over. This is here to stay as part of my routine.,1.0
"I have extremely sensitive skin and this product doesn’t make it act up at all. It visibly reduces my acne and comes full with product. I received this from Influenster, however when I run out I will definitely repurchase. I am in loveeeee! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1.0
"I was very excited about trying this product after seeing someone use it in their own skincare routine on instagram. I don’t have a lot of redness, mostly just under my eyes and just above my eyebrows into the hairline. This product DOES cover the redness, however, I find that it cakes into the creases and pores, once it “dries“ it looks like a powder. It doesn’t ever really dry to the touch, but it doesn’t look wet either. I just didn’t like the cake feeling. I’ll be returning this product.",0.0
Love the concept of color correcting redness while also providing sun protection but this product is not suitable for anyone with medium to tan/deep skin tones and will make you look gray/ashy.,0.0

This is a wonderful product! I received this for free in exchange for my honest review and I am blown away by it. It makes my skin so soft and supple and smooths out any fine lines and enlarged pores. It even makes my makeup go on smoother!

"Am I missing something regarding the hype of this product?Two months ago I bought this microfoliant along with the precleanse and cleansing gel (both of which I’m in love with!) but for some reason this exfoliating scrub just does nothing for me?First off, for such a pricey product, at least fill the bottle! This came maybeee 2/3 full at best...probably less.I’ve used as directed (mixing with a little bit of water until forming a paste and apply to damp face). I would be lying if I said my face didn’t feel smooth after because it does. But certainly much less than my fave exfoliating scrub (Ole Henriksen’s sauna scrub). Sadly this has just been sitting on my shelf and really should just be returned because I can’t see myself using it regularly in my skin care routine.",0.0

"It’s not bad. But I think I would have liked it more if I didn’t purchase it side by side with the First Aid Ultra Repair Cream, which is also a product for dehydrated skin. Between the two, I notice a bigger difference with the First Aid cream than with the Aqua Bomb, especially after extended use of both products. I also purchased the Belif Moisturizing Bomb and the Belif Peat Revital Cream at the same time, these two were for moisturizing rather than hydrating. If I had to rate all four products, it would be 1. Peat Revital, 2. Moisturizing Bomb, 3. Ultra Repair Cream, 4. Aqua Bomb. So overall, it’s good, but not great.",0.0

"I received this item as a free sample (in a Tatcha container, not from the store) with an online order. I haven’t liked any other Tatcha products because they’re too perfumed and they’re expensive. I couldn’t see any other samples I wanted to I chose this. A little about my skin: I am 36 years old with a moderate amount of sun damage (rode horses, showed dogs, and work a field job...so basically 20 solid years of sun damage). I have sensitive skin, some redness (my YTTP routine has diminished this drastically), textured skin, dry skin, am prone to clogged pores, and have had strong skin reactions to some products. This product doesn’t have a perfumed scent but is really watery which was a turn off for me at first. After about a week (sample lasted 2-3 weeks with two pumps a night), I noticed my skin tone looked a lot more even and I wasn’t having breakouts or dryness. The only things preventing me from continuing is 1) the cost is out of my comfort zone, and 2) I believe (could be wrong) that this product has a chemical exfoliator in it and I am super stoked to try the new YTTP scrub along with their toner (which I love) and I fear it would be too much for my skin. If I don’t like my other combo I might ditch that in place of this. Or perhaps alternate.",1.0

"This is amazing! A little goes a very long ways ! It’s so hydrating that my skin feels so amazing snd soft after. I only use it once a day!  It can’t affect deep set wrinkles or deep dark age spots . But it’s really helped my surface age issues a lot. It does smell a bit old lady powder scent but disappears quickly, it is quite expensive ! But it only takes a tiny bit to work so a full size bottles going to last a long long time. I got the sample size free in my Influenster VoxBox!",1.0
"I received this amazing product complimentary and decided to give it a try. I have super dry skin and was instantly in love with the liquid collagen and this cream.

"Overall this product worked as expected as step 1 in a double cleansing routine. After rinsing all of my makeup, including mascara, is gone. Please note that I do not wear heavy makeup, I typically wear a skin tint, light eye makeup, and mascara. I took off 2 stars as this product leaves a residue on my skin and in my hairline after rinsing requiring the use of a facial cleanser as a second step, and leaves an oily film on my eyes blurring my vision.Prior to trying this product I used Farmacy’s Green Clean and I will be switching back to it after I use up this container.",0.0

"It’s hard for me to keep this product on for the recommended time because of the smell. Very flowery and overpowering. As far as the results, i’ve never noticed a difference after using this product. That being said, it could be because you have to apply it regularly to see results after a bit, and for that I give it 3 stars. Potentially great, but not for me",0.0
"I recently recieved a sample of this. I have always heard great things about this product so I was very excited to try. Unfortunately, while I did not use this around the immediate we area, while rinsing my face a peice of the exfoliant ended up behind my eyelid. I was unable to remove it for 24hrs, it was so uncomfortable and I could feel the peice when I moved my eye. I will not be purchasing this product incase this happens again. For those who do use it I reccomend removing it with a cloth rather than rinsing your face the old fashioned way. You DO NOT WANT THESE PEICES IN YOUR EYE.  Hopefully no damage to my eye occurred.",0.0

"I usually skip the patch test when purchasing a new product and kinda just hope for the best. This time I decided to do patch test and I am so glad I did! I used three drops (the packaging suggests 1-12 drops) as I wanted to see results. Well, three drops turned my very fair arm into something that could have been mistaken for an oompa-loompa. I have now used the product (1 drop mixed with my Fresh moisturizer at night) a few times and it seems alright. The color is a bit too yellow to my liking but a bit of CC cream in the morning fixes that. The tan lasts about three days before I need to reapply. I’ve also tried the product on my legs and it gave a nice, natural result. All in all, a nice product but once I run out, I think I will try out the (unfortunately) more expensive product from Tan-Luxe.",1.0

If you have the extra money to splurge its a nice skin care. I do feel a change in how soft and smooth my skin is. It feels most hydrated and soft. I didnt see a change in my dark spots that I do have so it didn’t really help there which I was really excited about/for. No fragrance too over bearing. I’d purchase. I’d recommend to try because every skin is different I feel like my skin can be testy and others might get much better results.,1.0

"I’ve never come across a product that ticks all the boxes and I mean ALL! This sunscreen is THE BOMB! I’ve tried almost every sunscreen ever made and this one is perfect for combo/ oily skin!

I got this as a sample to try. I love the consistency of this product but not 100% sure it’s helped with my fine lines under my eyes as it’s only been 2 weeks. I think the concept is great would definitely consider purchasing this product as it gives my skin around my eyes needed moisture during these very cold days!,1.0
"Mixed emotions about this balm. I got it after using it to get some makeup off of my hands after swatching in store. It works VERY well at getting makeup off so I bought it.The pros to this product are that it takes VERY little product to get all of your makeup off so It might last longer than other products.  After using it all over my face I started to break out and felt like I was clogging my pores with it. I’ve heard that it doesn’t have the best ingredients which may be why it hasn’t worked well for my face. I now use it specifically for taking off eye makeup and use a proper cleanser for taking off my face makeup so I don’t break out. I have oily, acne prone skin, so i would say if you are concerned about using this product to just use the oil product in the same line which works just as well! After I run out of this I will be purchasing other products in this line instead of the balm.",0.0
It’s a nice cream! I don’t think it’s quite as moisturizing as they advertise it to be so I don’t know how great it would be for dry to very dry skin but for someone like me who has combination skin it was very nice!,1.0
"Omg. I don’t know where to begin. I was really excited about this product. I started using is on Tuesday night (today is Friday). I noticed breakouts the very next day, but decided to keep using it (thinking it might be a purge thing?). The issue is, I always use toners with BHA (Caudalie before this) so there really shouldn’t have been a purging period. This morning, I woke up with inflamed red white heads. But for some reason, I continued to use the product in my morning skincare. Well, when I got home and washed my face today, things had gotten entirely out of control. This product is by far the absolute WORST product I’ve ever, and I mean, EVER, applied to my face. I tend to try a ton of products without much difference. In my skin - so I rarely if ever leave a review. But I truly can’t imagine for the life of me how it works for anyone. I’m about to re-purchase Caudalie and plan to return this nightmare-in-a-bottle right back to Sephora. I know this product has been all the rage, and by all means, try it at your own risk if you must, but all I’m saying is: don’t do what I did. If you notice breakouts after your first use, then stop using it immediately, because from what I can tell you, it only gets worse from there.",0.0

"First off - thanks for creating a mask that’s not in a tube or a jar. I feel less messy and more hygienic. The mask, I was afraid would be too strong of an exfoliant for my skin, but I had no adverse effect. I wouldn’t say this is the best mask, but it is a decent mask and may take the whole container to see the results or know if it actually do anything. But I’m happy that my face didn’t feel like a desert after and that there was a bounce to it. I received this product free from Influenster to test out.",0.0

"This moisturizer is so beautiful smells great and does what it says. You’re for sure “Dewey” all day. However due to the high dimethicone levels, my skin broke out in tiny bumps every time I used it. I wanted to force this into my routine and it’s just not working. However it is very moisturizing. I did feel sometimes like it sat on top of my skin but my fave overall felt quenched. Just couldn’t manage the break outs and went back to my old moisturizer and the issue cleared itself within a week. I had the same issue with the water cream. While I love their other products the moisturizers don’t work for me. I also think it’s weird that they get the Sephora clean rating with such high dim levels.",0.0
"I received this product complimentary from Goop and I’m so glad I did (it comes with a hefty price tag). I tried it tonight for the first time as part of my bedtime routine. I used my regular cleanser from Ole Henriksen (wonderfeel). I normally use an exfoliator  throughout the week as well but skipped that tonight since I would already be using the goop exfoliator. I scooped about a quarter sized amount of product and applied to my face in circular motions. I tried to not use too much since it’s a relatively small container for $125. I left it on for 3 minutes and then rinsed off with warm water. I patted my face dry with a towel and applied my nighttime moisturizer and eye cream as I normally would. While applying the mask, I could feel the tiny beads exfoliating my face as I scrubbed in circular motions. Not a lot of pressure is necessary as it can feel a bit rough on the skin. I felt a small tingly sensation on my face as I let the mask sit. I noticed some redness on my cheeks and nose. This area remained rosy for about 15 minutes after removing the mask. I also still felt a bit of a tingle on parts of my face after having the mask removed (nothing painful or uncomfortable). Although I’ve only used it once so far, I did notice that my skin felt smoother and tighter. I didn’t notice any flakey or dull skin. The product suggests using 2-3 times a week so I’m confident that after some regular use, I’ll be able to see more noticeable results. The product does not have a strong smell and is a nice consistency and texture, making it easy to apply. While I’m happy to be able to use this product until it runs out, I will most likely not purchase a replacement. My reason being that it’s not a lot of product for $125. I know that I will get better results in one sitting for around that price if I went to a salon instead.",1.0
"This facial scrub is pretty good and gets the job done. I like how smooth and clean my skin feels right after use. The only concern that I have is the price as the standard size of this product costs $51.00 (CAD), which is a little on the expensive side of things. Apart from that, the product serves its purpose and is a great way to revive your skin at the end of a tough week!",1.0
"It’s okay. I don’t know if it’s worth $40 like, I’ve tried cleansers that do that same thing for a 3rd of the price. There is something about it that makes me want to repurchase just to confirm that it’s as mediocre as I think it is.",0.0
My first impressions are that it feels like most serums on my fingertips. It applies smoothly all over and soaks into the skin pretty quickly. It felt cool and fresh and like it was tightening my skin. Once dried completely there is no sticky residue. My skin felt smooth and soft and nourished. I have very dry skin so I added lotion on top but I do not feel everyone would need to. There is no synthetic fragrance to this product. I only experienced a very tiny hint of a fresh scent.,1.0
"Pros: mild cleanser that lathers well and leaves skin feeling clean without overstripping it of moisture. It has a light “grassy“ smell and goes away soon after you lather it into your skin. It did not irritate my sensitive combo skin nor did it break me out, which is a plus. Cons: the packaging is awful. Like several of the previous reviews, the product constantly leaks and it’s such a waste of product, especially if it costs $36 per bottle (and I really dislike wasting product). I would give it 4 stars if it wasn’t for the defective packaging. With so many other options of cleansers that are available, I would most likely not be purchasing this product again. I also didn’t really see a significant change in my skin after using this for the past few weeks.",0.0

"My skin was actually getting better... until I used this. My skin was actually smooth and free of pimples for once. I saw this online and saw it could help minimize pores and control sebum so I thought it would be perfect for my skin. It was the complete opposite. I’ve been using this for only two days, and my skin is already severely breaking out. Multiple blackheads have formed. I’ve literally NEVER gotten blackheads in my entire life. The pimples then proceeded to grow larger and painful, becoming angry red bumps that are severely inflamed. I have no idea what to do. I’m really disappointed with the results, especially because almost everywhere I’ve read, it hyped it up. I don’t know why my reaction was so different to the rest of the reviews. Does someone know what could possibly have happened?",0.0
I just don’t get the hype. It has an uncomfortably sticky consistency that just doesn’t feel hydrating at all. The scent is very “off” and hard to describe (like plastic or rubber). I don’t see this being overly helpful for those with combo/dry skin. Price is fantastic though!,0.0

"The Ordinary is one of the best honest skincare brands out there at an affordable price. Niacinamide is a key ingredient in helping treat acne as long as you use it right, and given this is 10% it might be too much for those who have sensitive skin or aren’t used to having that high of a percentage of niacinamide. If you use multiple serums especially during the daytime, I suggest using this at night to give time for the serum to absorb into the skin completely",1.0
"I was so excited to try this especially after all the hype around it, so I finally decided to order a mini size to test it out.

"When I say this product is unmatched I mean it. I tried this out as a sample a few months ago and when I ran out, I couldn’t bring myself to spend the $$ for more. I tried a couple of dupes, but NOTHING compares to this cream. It leaves my skin feeling SO soft and the texture is like whipped butter that melts into the skin. I haven’t been able to find a better (or even similar) water cream.",1.0

"Due to all of the (over)hype, I was excited to try the superfood cleanser because it had nice packaging, ingredients, and said it was for sensitive skin. It dried my skin out immediately after washing. I hadn’t changed anything else in my routine, so I know it was this cleanser. For how stripping and harsh it was, it didn’t even cleanse my skin. I’m glad I only bought the travel size because I had to give it away and switched to a much gentler (and cheaper!) cleanser. While I’m not positive, my skin may have been sensitive to the cocamidopropyl betaine in this cleanser, but regardless, this specific formula is way too harsh for my skin.",0.0
Love this lip mask. I use it daily and at night.The product has lasted me really long time and helps keep my lips moisturized throughout the year.,1.0
Don’t waste ur money. Does absolutely nothing. Like nothing at all. It’s hard to slide on and honestly a waste of money.,0.0
"I really wanted to love this. I waited for it to come back in stock and ordered it right away to make sure that I could get it. After using it for a a couple of weeks my skin developed tiny red dots all over. They also took forever to go away. Usually when I get a zit it clears up quickly but not these. I am really sad I wasted my money on this, and only bought it because of all the other great reviews. If i hadn’t given it so much time, I would have returned it. Very disappointing product. Its not even super hydrating, and I don’t really feel like its a mask. You’d be better off ordering a real mask or wearing a good quality moisturizer instead of this.",0.0
"My skin is very dry and sensitive. I purchase due to the high number of positive reviews, as I was trying to clear up the very few hormonal pimples I had. My skin was near perfect before using this product besides the maybe 2 hormonal pimples I had, and let me tell you this wrecked my skin. It is red, irritated, and I have white bumps all over my chin. I couldn’t figure out what the culprit was until the aesthetician I see read the ingredients in this and told me this was the cause. I never take time to write reviews but my self confidence has plummeted to the ground because of this product and I want others with sensitive skin like me to steer clear! Thankfully my aesthetician has me on a regimen now that’s in the process of getting my skin healed but I am so upset I ever tried this out. DONT BUY!",0.0
"I got this as a sample and I loved the smell so I bought a the trial size from a gift set. I do like the cream!! I usually use the Tatcha cleanser and am used to a pea sized amount. I needed to use 6-8 pea sized drops to cover my face which was half the bottle! This product caused my face physical pain and left my skin with dry patches, you can see - big one in my it in myphoto! The product also pilled up on my face and felt abrasive instead of exfoliating. I do not recommend this product!",0.0
Loved this toner! Packaging is great. It worked well without feeling too tight. Great smelling!,1.0

You don’t need much to moisturize your face. It leaves a slight warm or tingle sensation after but hardly noticeable feeling. Goes on smooth and is very light. Not oily. Leaves your face moisturized and with a slight glow.,1.0
"Yikes, this did not work very well for me! I followed the directions and tested the product on my inner elbow first to make sure my skin wouldn’t react. All was well, so I proceeded to use the product on my face, neck, and chest area, as recommended in the instructions. The next morning I awoke to fine my face feeling quite smooth and was pleased...until I looked in the mirror and found bright red splotches all over my chest area! They didn’t hurt or itch, but they did linger the entire day. Maybe test the product elsewhere before using so you don’t have the same issue as me!",0.0
"GET IT. been using it for maybe two years just wrote a review to show my appreciation. does make me break out at all, and is really great at taking off makeup and properly cleansing the skin. Great for all skin types and is super gentle so would be even better for sensitive skin types.",1.0
"Love, love, love! My favorite out of the over 20 cleansing balms and oils I have tried. I received as a free sample in one of my orders and use at night for part 1 of my double cleansing routine. It’s the first thing I apply before I head into the shower and let it soak in for a couple of minutes before I rinse off (I took the advice of another reviewer) to let the enzymes do their magic. It feels heavenly, luxurious, and does not sting my sensitive eyes! It takes off all my water resistant mineral sunscreen and makeup and waterproof mascara in a breeze, without tugging. And it’s gentle on my combination, sensitive, occasional breakouts skin. My face appears more radiant after I use. I am purchasing a full size after I’m done with the deluxe sample size.",1.0
Glad a I bought a small mini size before committing a purchase of the full size. This product just sits on top of your skin. Your skin never absorbs it. It also stains your pillowcase…so what’s the point?,0.0
"Applied a small dab to my hand before trying on my face and was SHOOK. I immediately saw the little grooves in my dry af hand plump up!!

BUT this cream has been a freaking Christmas miracle!!! I have been using for a week now, along with the Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Face Cleanser and I absolutely adore it!Great for my sensitive and thirsty skin; no strong odor; no sticky residue; feels luxurious/silky and my skin feels hydrated all day/night.

So many people loved the old formula, it was wonderful!Anyway, I have to return this moisturizer now.

"ok eye cream. receive a sample to try out. it’s not bad, but also not the best. I have sensitive eye lids so I’m looking for something that won’t sting my eyes. this is questionable.

"I received the Vitamin Enriched Face Base Priming Moisturizer for reviewing purposes. I have heard great things and was excited to try it!Pros:- Very moisturizing- Smells good- Thick consistency but was easy to spread on the faceCons:- Made my face break out with large pimples, but I have sensitive skin- My oily-prone areas (chin) was even more oily than it usually is- Unfortunately, I didn’t see much of an increase in wear-time or smoothness of my foundation/concealer. This was more like a moisturizer than a primer for me.- ExpensiveI wouldn’t recommend this for people with very oily skin. Only use it on the dry areas of your face and during winter.",0.0
Love love love this moisturizer!!! I fell in love after receiving a sample and then went out and bought my own. If you prefer gel moisturizers this will definitely be a fav! It feels super refreshing and moisturizing without leaving you feeling greasy or oily.,1.0

"I have a love-hate relationship with this product. I have extremely Sensitive skin, it is combination and it is prone to hormonal breakouts. Pros: wear it on top of make up as long as you take a Q-tip and remove the make up off of the spot. It does blend in with your skin you can wear it on top of make up as long as you take a Q-tip and remove the make up of the spot. I do notice that I don’t pick at the spot as much and that the spot doesn’t get any larger. I cannot figure out if it is because there is a patch on my pimple so I cannot scratch at it. I’ve been using this for two weeks now and on one side of my face I used this product on the other side of my face used the ordinary, niacinamide and zinc. After two days I noticed that the ordinary had completely gotten rid of any acne spots that I had. The patch did not get rid of them they were still there and I was having to peel off one patch to put on another patch over and Over. That caused a little more irritation. Save your money and go with the ordinary brand, niacinamide and zinc and use it as a spot treatment. After using these for two weeks this is what it did to my skin.",0.0
"I can’t say enough good things about this Pitera Essence. Just a few drops refreshes your whole face.

"Good cleanser for removing makeup on skin, but I wouldn’t buy it again because you can’t use it on your eyes.

Wouldn’t recommend for that reason alone.",0.0

"The “Advanced Black Tea Advanced Cream” was gifted by Fresh and I am inlove!!!!!! Omg! My skin feels amazing. I am all for moisturizing products. I have both sensitive and dry skin and this cream feels like skin food. Very light weight, skin is glowy and firm afterwards. I LOVE IT!",1.0
"Bought the smaller size just to try, and it really dries out my skin in the winter. Makes my skin flaky and dry. Glad I didnt purchase the full size",0.0
This would be great for those living in warmer climates. That matte finish stays matte throughout the day. I apply this sunscreen after toning and applying either an essence or cream. This glides over anything shiny and transforms into a matte finish. No scent which I love. Now this can irritate sensitive eyes so be careful not to get too close. I learned the hard way by applying this before jogging outside and the sweat combined with the sunscreen trickled down to my eyes. Irritating. So it’s not a workout sunscreen. But it’s good as a daily matte sunscreen.,1.0
It’s good but not worth $100+. It was hydrating but there was no immediate results like it claims. I wouldn’t waste your money. I received this free to test from influencer,0.0
This is a great product. Smell is very clean. It goes on easily but feels dense which makes me confident that there is something going on. My face feels extremely supple and fresh after using at night. I only have the cream and would like to add the serum to see what the 1-2 punch could do but is checking all the boxes to be my nextMoisturizer. My skin is starting to look more even and lines are reducing.,1.0
"I got this for free to try out from Influenster and I actually really enjoyed it. The brush that comes with it actually makes applying it easy. Also washing it off is no hassle. Saw a difference the next morning, my face was less oily! As for pore size that might take a few more uses.",1.0
"Since I received the free sample with one of purchases I’ve been obsessed with this face cleanser. The little travel size bottle lasted me about 2-3 weeks (and I used it everyday) as you only need a bit for every use. It’s doesn’t foam up but it gets into a creamy texture. As an exfoliant it’s scary because you’re not sure if it will dry out your face or if the traditional little beads in the exfoliant will be too much, but this exfoliant is perfect it only has a few beads and the smell is great, it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry and I can feel how clean it is. I have very large pores around my nose area and within two weeks of using it *gross part is coming* I squeezed around my large pores and a bunch of black heads just started coming out with almost no pressure so I didn’t damage my skin from squeezing and everything still came out. I have continued this process and I can see that some of the pores are now smaller. I bought the large version and refilled my travel size and I don’t think I will stop using it.",1.0
I really wanted to like this. I was super hopeful especially when reading prior reviews. This left my eyes hydrated but i got nothing else out of it. I didn’t notice any changes to my dark circles or fine lines. Maybe i need to use for longer? I am still in search of my perfect eye cream.,0.0
"Received a sample of this using my Sephora points (but I really just wanted the Avocado eye mask that it came with). Hyaluronic is in a lot of things, so I just don’t think I need a dedicated serum for that extra moisture. But with that said, I don’t enjoy the feel of this as it dries. It’s rather sticky and tacky, even when you make sure to apply it to damp skin. However, if I was looking for a product for extra moisture in the form of hyaluronic, in the mid-priced range, I do enjoy First Aid Beauty’s ultra repair serum, or in the affordable range, The Inkey List’s collagen serum -- and both of those also include peptides. This is just too expensive for what it is and offers. Maybe it’s good for some people, but it’s not for me.",0.0
Absolutely loving this Magic Cream! My face feels smooth and plump and my wrinkles not as prominent.  I’m also enjoying the fact that my dark spots are not as dark.  Whatever kind of voodoo Charlotte Tilbury is putting into this cream works well! It’s a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. Perfect moisturizer for under makeup too. All things considered this is one of my favorite moisturizers.,1.0
"One of my favorite masks of all time. Any time I feel like there’s a layer of dull yuck on my face that a good scrub won’t take off, I go straight for this peel. I’ve used this for about a year and a half and it does the trick every time for my mid-30s skin. Tip: FOLLOW DIRECTIONS TO THE T! Make sure your skin (hands also) is completely dry- like bone dry- before putting this stuff on or it will sting like crazy. Leave on for 10mins max! Not 10 minutes and 30 seconds, etc. Maximum. 10 minutes.",1.0
"This obviously works for a lot of people, but I’m on Accutane, so obviously have very dry skin. I was using Elemis cleansing balm and decided to try this due to high reviews, and it’s just, not for dry skin at all. I’ll be going back to Elemis after I get through this.",0.0

This eye cream has worked so well for me and has not irritated my very sensative skin/eyes and it has a killer price point!",1.0

"After using @belifCanada The True Cream --- Moisturizing Bomb* for the past month, my throughts are not the most positive.Pros/Neutrals:This cream does provide instant moisture. It feels lightweight and sinks in well, while also feeling like it hydrates. It has a faint fragrance, which was initially off-putting, but I got used to it over time. I’ll caveat that by adding that most of my products are unscented, so the introduction of a scent is very noticeable for me.Cons:Despite initially feeling hydrated, my skin starts to feel tight and dry within 4-6 hours of applying it. I’ve experienced peeling skin this past month, when I usually never do. My maskne has also been worse, with little change to any other component of my routine. Hard to say if these are the results of changing weather or changing my moisturizer. I suspect the latter since my confidence in my previous moisturizers was incredibly high.*complimentary PR from @Influenster",0.0
"Love this product! A super hydrating option that works for my combination skin, even when layered with other facial serums and oils.

It’s super lightweight and the smell it’s not overpowering (thumbs up because I suffer from migraines). And I simply love the glow it leaves afterwards, just look at it.

"I don’t tend to get Clinique products since they make me break out, but with such great reviews I decided to give this a try. I regretted it immediately after my first use!! First off, I was unsure of how much product to use to be able to cover my face and avoid having to go in for more product. I don’t think you want to “double dip” since the consistency kind of forces you to push on the product to break it up and get the amount you want. It does easily go from a firm to oily texture, so if you go in for more you might get used oil (dirt and make up) on the clean product. Not that big of a deal, but probably worth noting. My eyes, however, became so irritated to the point that  as soon as it became oily I had to wipe it off. I didn’t give it a chance to really work it’s magic I suppose, but I was so scared and concerned about my skin that I had to take it off. Once I had taken all the product off, my eye lids were red, extremely stripped, and felt somewhat scaly (which has never been an issue before). I put on a soothing eye moisturizer right away so I can’t say if it would of gotten worse but I definitely did not want to find out. Not for me.",0.0
"This product is amazing.  I’ve had acne prone skin my entire life as well as very sensitive, combination skin.

But since then I have been skipping more nights (once every 3 nights or so) and that works.  My skin literally looks years younger, glowy, my pores are smaller, I have a more even and less red skin tone, and my skin feels soft, incredibly smooth, and supple.  It even makes my T-zone less oily!I definitely add a bit of moisturizer after I let this dry, otherwise I think it would dry out my skin slightly, but I’m a huge fan.  This stuff is like magic.",1.0
"Very light texture/formula, too much scent, not many beneficial ingredients for skin",0.0
This stuff is great if you have oily skin! I was using the Purity moisturizer and I would get so oily throughout the day that I had to touch up with powder two hours into wearing make up. I didn’t think switching my moisturizer would make a difference. This stuff has made the biggest difference in controlling my oil and I can go so much longer without touching up. It leaves my skin so smooth!,1.0
Started to use daily and this became part of my daily routine. Face texture has changed and became smoother. Also alternate with the  (white) classic rice enzyme powder. Using these for life because it simply works. One jar will last quite a while.,1.0
Overall I like this product.  I wasn’t dying to go buy it or anything but it is good moisturizer   it’s light weight with no scent  and a small amount goes a long way.

I’ve noticed that it also has a little bit of sparkle to it, but it’s not like my lips feel gritty. As I said before, this feels thick, so you want to be careful to not apply too much, otherwise you’ll feel a little gunky and gross. I find that swiping a little bit of product with the smaller end of the golden spoon is more than enough to apply all over my lips. I’m super happy with this purchase and think that anyone with dry lips (and looking to splurge) should try this out!",1.0

Makeup goes over it beautifully! But after about 10 days, I also started seeing a lot of clogged pores. I am not breakout-prone, and I know it isn’t backlash breakout, because I use Retin-A and get enzyme facials. I really wanted to like this, because it would’ve replaced two products in my regimen. I just can’t recommend it, because overall, if it gave me trouble, it’ll give a lot of people trouble, I’m sure.",0.0

I just simply can’t give it the full 5 stars because I find it to be such a nightmare to get off.I probably won’t repurchase, but will continue use until empty.",0.0
"Honestly, I feel like my skin was restored after first application! I was so nervous to use an oil in fear of breaking out, but I was so desperate due to my DRY, flaking skin! My skin actually has not flaked since the night I applied this to my skin. I use every night - cleanse, ordinary hyaluronic acid serum, THIS OIL, then my moisturizer. GAME CHANGER.",1.0
This product has beautiful packaging but that is about it. The sunscreen does not mix well with other skincare products and balls up even if I wait over an hour between applying my moisturizer and this sunscreen. I also have very fair skin and this sunscreen needs to be rubbed in really well or it will leave a white cast. I will be returning it.,0.0

I was pretty excited to receive this product but like many other reviews was very disappointed in the price in comparison to the size and volume in the jar. I am 100% returning this product; I can’t justify spending as much as I did on such a minimal amount of moisturizer. Save your money and purchase something where you get more bang for your buck.,0.0

I really wanted to love this eye cream but it just didn’t do it for me. The texture is amazing and it felt like the cream absorbed nicely into the skin. But I was left with a really dry undereye area and on the sides of my eyes -- my skin was piling and peeling!,0.0
Did nothing. Feel like the product is overhyped. I was excited to try it but disappointed,0.0
I love the way it makes my face feel so smooth due to the creamy wash. It takes off all my makeup and does not dry out  or make my face oily.,1.0
I got this product for free for promotional purposes. This stuff is great! I use hyaluronic acid often so my skin isn’t very sensitive to products with this much acid in it. It does not tingle too much and it’s not too harsh on the skin if you have sensitive skin. The only flaw is sometimes I get it on my lips and it tastes exactly like a lemon... But I love lemons and so it’s not a big deal haha this product help my skin definitely even help with some of the redness/blotchy areas I was having,1.0
"I received a free sample of this serum to try in exchange for my honest opinion. I had enough in the sample to use for a couple of nights only, but loved the texture and how it felt on my skin.

"This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty to me to review, but opinions are all my own.I have really dry skin and am always looking for great moisturizers, especially for winter. I was excited to try this cream as it’s loaded with hydrating ingredients. It’s got a thick and buttery texture to it that easily glides onto skin and instantly makes it feel comforted. I love how the packaging includes a metal spatula that sticks to the top so I don’t have to stick my hands right into the pot and potentially contaminate it with germs. I’ve been using this cream at night for the past two weeks and have been really liking using it as the last step in my routine. I’ve also mixed it with Farmacy’s Honey Savior to create a thick overnight mask and my skin loved that combination! I haven’t worn it yet as a day cream, but I had read a review on Instagram that says it wears well under makeup so I’m looking forward trying that. Since I’ve been using this I have been waking up to skin that is hydrated and happy. I really can’t say enough good things about this cream and will definitely be repurchasing it with my own money when I run out of this pot.",1.0
"This scrub smells nice, but it was very abrasive. The product is not for those with sensitive skin. I will likely just use this as a body scrub because it felt really rough  on my face. I’m also feels a bit overkill to have an AHA in a face scrub.",0.0
"Huge disappointment. After reading through some reviews and watching a few youtube videos, it seems like this balm is manufactured in an extremely inconsistent way. Some people get a thick, waxy ointment. Others get a thin, oily substance. Mine came out kind of like a yellowish gel. That’s a huge red flag -- each product should behave exactly the same. I tried this on dry and damp skin. It went on like petrolatum, and would not emulsify or wash off. Had to do a triple cleanse, which on my sensitive skin is a no-no. I cannot fathom the love for this, except for maybe some of us are getting bad batches, and others are getting a version that actually works. Returned.",0.0
This is amazing!  Just a little goes a long way.  My only con is that I wish it were in a wider mouthed container. One of the best makeup removers I’ve ever used.,1.0
"Not sure how this works for other people, but if it does, lucky you!Been holding on to a deluxe sample of the Dewy Cream for a while, maybe I spent Sephora points on it? Anyways, thought it’d be amazing, but it did not play nice with my other products, all of which are clean/organic.After a process of elimination, research, and reapplying my entire skincare regimen multiple times, I believe the pilling issue is due to the Dimethicone in the Dewy Creme, which is high up on the ingredients list and widely considered a not “clean” ingredient. This does not absorb into skin, sits on top to give a smoothing effect.Will never purchase.",0.0
"I was very excited to get this, thought it would be great for my eyes and awesome to throw in my gym bag because of the cooling effect. This product completely dried out my under eye area and made them red, patchy, and itchy. I have never seen my skin react like this to a product, and I have very oily skin so the dryness really stunned me. I couldn’t believe how horribly my skin reacted. I love the concept and packaging but this did not work for me, going to try the watermelon serum out.",0.0
"I’ve spent so much money on skincare products, in hopes of finding something life changing for my skin. My mentality was, the most money I spend the better the product. Which is totally not true, yes there are some products that are definitely worth the splurge, and i’ve tried a large variety of different oils for my skin. Oils to me is an essential part of my skin care routine, ESPECIALLY in the winter. I absolutely LOVE this oil, and will repurchase once this is done, but it seems like it’ll last quite a while.",1.0

"I really wanted to love this product, but it dried out my skin. I first tried a sample of it and it felt like it firmed up my skin and felt clean. But after continued use, I found that it tightened my skin uncomfortably and gave me dry patches around my nose and cheeks. Packaging is top notch, gel lather is light and it smelled clean without being too antiseptic. However, the price is wayyy to much for how little you get. Also don’t be fooled by using a moisturizer after cleansing with this, it may be doing more harm than good.",0.0
This kept my skin flawless and smooth all day! I received it free from Influenster and was so surprised how beautiful my skin looked all day!,1.0

"I bought this product on a whim one day and I kind of regret it. It feels decently hydrating, but takes a few more pats than I’d prefer to sink in.

I haven’t seen any notable improvements in my under eye area and will definitely not be repurchasing.",0.0

"This was disappointing, it really didn’t do much at all. The little stick should have been attached to the packaging like it is with the creams. It did not moisturize, I don’t know why. The texture was great, it felt good at first, but it didn’t ‘repair’ my lips. I don’t know if there’s an irritating ingredient in there for me, maybe that’s the case as I have very sensitive lips. It’s too bad, I love Tatcha.",0.0
It needs a real lid. It is thin liquid consistancy. Knock it over it’s done for. Try pouring it you’ll get to much. It needs a real lid with a small hole like toner. I just dropped mine day 3 and it’s done for and all over my carpet. And a method of no contamination would be nice.,0.0

"I like this eye mask generally speaking, it’s rich and moisturizing, not as effective as other retinol product and the percentage of it is pretty much non-existent, it’s not worth the amount of money they charge for what’s in the cream so I took a star off.I took another star off because the ad video at sephora.ca showed the jar with a lot more product, filled up to the rim, but when I got my jar it was barely half of the jar, there was a big air bubble in the middle of the jar so there was honestly a lot less product than I expected. Dishonesty is a turn off.",0.0
"I LOVE this toner! I ordered the mini size to try it out and quickly discovered how much I adore it, and before even finishing the mini bottle, I ordered the full sized one- and I’m on my third bottle now! I find that a lot of toners make my skin sting, but I also have learned that I am developing sensitive skin as I’m aging. But NOT this one! This toner has almost a liquid jelly like consistency- not watery like all of the other toners I’ve tried. It feels super soothing on my skin and doesn’t make it feel dried out or tight, rather, I feel like I could even ditch moisturizer if I needed to. I apply it with my hands night and day. This has helped me clear my acne and soothe and refresh my skin. As far as minimizing pores, I haven’t noticed that AS much, but it definitely keeps my oil at bay! The smell is really nice, too, not super overwhelming or “sweet“, I definitely enjoy it, but if you don’t like scents, I would probably give a pass on this one. But if you can overlook the smell, this is an amazing toner. It sits really well under moisturizer and foundation. I switch products frequently, as I almost never find a product that stands out to me, but THIS is a must have in my skin care regimen and I plan to repurchase every time I run out.",1.0
"Im so impressed with this product. Its possible to see the diference after the 1st day of use. Long life herb e niaciamid are completely fabolous, made everything for my skin.

"This product is so silicone-y! For a chemical sunscreen, I question whether this actually sinks into the skin and performs correctly. It just kind of...sits on my skin, transfers easily, doesn’t dry down. I pat in my sunscreens, and assume that’s the best way to apply this as a high silicone product too. I got this in a small size, so I guess I’ll just use this in a pinch when I have nothing else.",0.0
"The Inkey List is my new favorite skincare line. Compared to the Ordinary, which didn’t do much for my skin, these products make my skin feel and look noticeably different.

I’m a big fan of what this product did for my combination skin. Left it feeling hydrated but not greasy...no breakouts or negative reactions. I used it in the summer, but I can only imagine how great it will be during the cold and dry winter. That being said, I’ll go purchase a different brand at Target or ULTA or something. Seems like you’re paying a premium for the Josie Maran name.",0.0

It has a very smooth consistency and absorbs rather quickly so no worries about transferring to my pillow right before bed. Would highly recommend",1.0
I was gifted this product by Influenster to review! I like this cream a lot ! Honestly I don’t have signs of aging yet so I can’t speak on that.

"I can see why people love this, but if you have chronic chapped lips and are sensitive to certain products, beware.  If this was unscented and unflavored I think it would be great, as it is deeply moisturizing, thick and lasts almost through an entire night of sleep.  That said, I think the flavored component completely ruins the product.  My lips reacted poorly to this and ended up bumpy and more chapped after only a couple nights of use.",0.0
For $70 I expected something to happen. I used this for 3 months until the last drop and saw no results. Sure it smells nice but I won’t be buying it again if it doesn’t do what it says it will. I’m going to try the real retinol now.,0.0

I have super dry skin and my dry skin loves this so much it hydrates my face rlly GOOD!,1.0
This product is ok.... but overpriced. Warning! It looks like there’s a lot of formula inside but there isn’t. The whole top part is just for the press thing so it comes out and you’d think it reaches all the way to the bottom but it’s just a block at the bottom (if you get what I mean). It’s not even the whole thing. It doesn’t reach all the way to the top of the bottle and it doesn’t reach all the way to the bottom either. I’d look for another moisturizer that is worth the price for the amount of formula they’re handing you. And this makes me look like a tomato after I apply it.,0.0
In my opinion it did nothing ! i don’t wear waterproof mascara & it was really stubborn to remove my mascara,0.0

This is an excellent moisturizer! I noticed an immediate difference after just 1 use. It has a very thick consistency that goes on silky smooth with no greasiness. It has a very subtle scent that is lovely. It’s a clean scent that reminds me of freshly shampooed/conditioned hair. I would 100% recommend for its moisturizing ability. I feel I would need a few more weeks of use to give a review on the wrinkle/fine line smoothing properties.,1.0

"While I love the look and feel of regular lipstick, I prefer those all-day liquid lipsticks or “lip paints“ as I find they stay and wear a lot better throughout my long work day, without the need to constantly reapply. HOWEVER, these often dry out my lips so much and end up looking cakey and cracked by the end of the day, and by the time I take it off at night, the skin of my lips is also cracked and peeling from being so dried out. THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE SOLUTION. I put this on at night, and by morning, my lips are so extremely moisturized and soft that I can use my “lip paints“ without them caking up or drying out and cracking like before. Now my liquid lipsticks actually look fresh the entire day! And my lips aren’t completely cracked and dry when I take them off in the evening! I’ve actually come to adore this stuff so much, that I have started to wear just the teensiest amount (barely enough to cover my lips, so as not to disturb the drying of my liquid lipstick) under the lip paints during the day, which makes my lips look seriously so plump and moisturized and allows my liquid lipstick to stay in place but look moisturized. When I use this stuff, whether just at night or to “help out“ my day lip products, my lips look like they just had injections with how plump and moisturized they are. It’s freaking fantastic and I’m obsessed. I’m pretty sure I this will be a constant staple to my routine (alongside it’s “water sleeping mask“ for my face, which breathes new life into my combination skin and completely evens out and controls both my oil and dry parts of my face). I’m officially obsessed with Laneige products and will keep them alongside my other favorite items.",1.0

I usually use this cleanser after a normal cleanser, because I don’t use it on my eye area so I need something to remove makeup. It really helps to even out my skins texture and I truest love this product!",1.0
"I was excited to use this sample that came with my Sephora birthday gift. I have oily/combo skin. I wouldn’t say that I have sensitive skin, but I reacted to this cleanser. Although it didn’t leave my skin feeling tight, it caused itchy red areas all over the lower half of my face (particularly along my jaw line). After I stopped using this product, it went away. I’m giving it two stars because it has a very light, neutral fragrance and felt nice on the skin during the cleansing routine.",0.0
SO greasy! Left me all broken out! Won’t use again,0.0
"Wow! Such a lovely product. Beautiful packaging and super easy to apply. The texture is gorgeous too. I have always been such a fan of Sunday Riley, their products have beautiful packaging and really do work and provide such promising results. Love!",1.0
"I purchased this cream to replace my R+F morning cream. I live in a super dry climate and if I don’t use the proper hydrating creams my skin literally flakes. After a week of using the product I’m sad to say it just doesn’t cut it. My skin absorbs it super quick and it smells great, but once the makeup goes on I can see the dry areas.",0.0
Was not worth the hype. I just felt like I was cheating myself out of a better exfoliating cleanser. Love their other products though!,0.0
"I have very oily and combination skin.  Super slick on my forehead and nose area.  This worked amazing at first but then dried up my forehead terribly!  It’s red and flaky, even scaly like the worst chemical burn.  On my face of all places!  Returning the big one I just purchased after buying a small trial size set.  So disappointed because I loved the way it made my pores look on my nose.",0.0
Amazing Product I enjoy using the product so much my skin feels amazing.,1.0
"Why is there plastic in my “green“ cleanser? I so wanted to love this product. It works great, smells nice, and doesn’t dry my face out. But I realized after purchase that this product contains Polyethylene, which is plastic. You’re just washing microplastics down the drain using this product, it’s just as bad as using a product with micro beads. I wish Sephora would exclude products containing plastics in their “Clean at Sephora“ classification.",0.0
Awesome product! My skin feels instantly hydrated after one use.  The product does not have a strong scent which I appreciate as it is the second last step in my skin care routine and I don’t like heavy scents sitting on my face all day.  Overall it was a nice product and I will purchase in the future,1.0
This smells amazing and feel great on my skin!! My skin looks amazing when I use this cream.,1.0
"Really wanted to like this as love all DE products, however the  cleanser does not melt as the IT cosmetics version or the Farmacy Green version does - the idea behind this is to melt away make up. I have found myself having to cleanse again with a cleanser after. So disappointed in this! the magnetic spoon is a great idea though!",0.0
This is such a gentle yet powerful cleanser. It’s enough to last you a month and really give you a feel for what the cleanser does for your skin. I’m definitely upgrading and investing in the full size!,1.0
One of my go to moisturizers!! It lasts me so long because a little goes a long way! It’s got good natural ingredients and smells so refreshing. Love love this for the AM.,1.0

"I decided to try out the Unseen sunscreen after loving the defense refresh setting mist. This is a clear gel that glides on very easily. It is lightweight, doesn’t have a strong scent and helps minimize pores! I love using all of supergoops products. My skin hasn’t had a bad reaction to any of their products!",1.0
"So, I have been using this product for about three weeks now. It is amazing. It makes my skin soft and glow. I’ve had people compliment in ways I cannot share publicly. But I am rating it four stars because while it is amazing, I don’t know how to pronounce squalane and I’ve used a facial cream that has given me the same feeling and compliments but half the cost.",1.0
"I’ve been using this for almost a year now and I love it! My skin feels soft and plump every time. I think the effect was maybe stronger the first couple of times but I still see results. Also, I purchased this for a second time since first bottle lasted about 9 months and I use a fair amount of product 1-2 times every day - I figured the price tag was worth it. NOTE: this is the first essence I tried so I wouldn’t know if I could get similar results with a cheaper one, however until I find that, I’ll stick to this one.",1.0

"I was skeptical about using this overnight but was very pleasantly surprised! This product feels light weight and refreshing.  It absorbed quickly into my skin and I woke up with soft, smooth skin.  I have oily skin so sometimes I don’t like have thick moisturizing products sitting on my face but this product doesn’t feel that way at all.  I have noticed that my makeup is wearing more smoothly throughout the day as well.",1.0
Have been using this for the past 6 months. Helps skin look more radiant and lighten dark spots. Love it! It’s pricey but will last 3-4 months. Worth the price,1.0
This stuff is amazing! I use it once a week and it leaves my skin feeling baby soft! It has helped with texture and diminishing my very dark spots. It will always be a part of my skin care routine.,1.0
"This just didn’t work for me. I used almost the whole bottle because I just kept telling myself it just needs one more week. I would use as part of my skincare routine every time I washed my face, so 2-3 times a day. The  only difference i noticed was that my skin was more moisturized.  My skin texture was the same and my skin wasnt evened out. I saw better results with my face oils. Three stars for making my skin feel super moisturized.",0.0

"My skin looked brighter after one use, and now at a week into using it my forehead fine lines have diminished.  My dryness has subsided as well.  It does have a strong scent to it, but it’s not so bad.",1.0
"The initial smell of this cleansing balm was okay, but after rubbing it in, the smell gets worse. I told myself I would get used to it, but nope. I don’t hate myself that much. I was only able to use it twice. The first time to try the product and the second to understand why I hated it the first time. It leaves a residue on my skin afterwards, which I didn’t like. I’m sticking to cleaning oils. Others may love it better than I did. If It did work out the plus side is that it is a large amount of product for a cheap price.",0.0

"I used a trial of this and I don’t think it was good for my dry skin. It made my face more dry but slightly shiny and uneven textured, this took a couple of days to go back to normal. I don’t know if it’s because the benefits of this product take daily use to see, but from my single use tester i wouldn’t buy it.",0.0
This a great light weight moisturizer. Since I do have oily skin when I wake up I tent to have really oily skin more then the usual. So I just use it before I apply makeup.,1.0
I am super impressed with this moisturizer. I have dry skin to the point where everyone can see it flaking off my face. Usually moisturizers work for me for only a couple of hours before my skin starts flaking again. This is the first moisturizer I have used that keeps my face moisturized the whole day. I am in love with this and will definitely be using it for a long time.I also just wanted to give a shout-out to the employees at the Sephora in City Creek in Salt Lake City. They were all very helpful and listened to me thoroughly before recommending a couple of moisturizers they thought would work for me. Great job you guys!,1.0
I really like this cleaning oil. It definitely wipes off the day! It doesn’t leave behind an oily residue either. Leaving my face feeling so fresh.,1.0

"I wanted to love this product, believe me I DO love it. My skin, not so much. I’m pretty sure my face started breaking out after daily use. I do love how it makes my skin feel afterwards but not loving the reaction I’m having to this product.",0.0
"I seem to be in the minority here but I’m really not crazy about this product. I received it for free in exchange for a review. Right off the bat, I loved the packaging. Something about glass bottles always feels elite lol The spout is also a neat design. Personally I’m not a fan of really watery products. I always feel like some of it leaks en route to my face. Applying it felt much like patting water onto my face which I didn’t mind at all, as I’m not a fan of heavy products. However, I can’t tell you a single thing this did for my skin. I used it consistently every day hoping to see the plumpness and moisturized effect others have mentioned. Nothing!  If I grazed my finger across my face it felt soft, much like a face primer. But visually it seemed to not make a difference. I live in a DRY climate so I really expected something but alas, it wasn’t meant to be.",0.0
"This product was gifted to me by Glow Recipe.I have been using this product every night for almost two weeks, and I have to say that overall, I’m impressed. I will start by saying that at my age (29), I’m beginning to see more obvious lines underneath my eyes, but I feel it is still minimal. Hence, I did not notice major differences with diminished appearance of fine lines. The area underneath my eyes do feel smoother in texture. For a retinol product, this did not cause me dryness, and kept my skin moisturized and brightened the area, which contributes to a nice canvas to apply makeup the next morning after cleansing. Again, I only use this product at night, and not underneath makeup.I love the texture of the product. It’s thick, but not greasy. So easy to apply as well. I would like to continue using this product longer to determine whether I will be including it in my daily routine. BUT I do have high hopes from what I have experienced these past weeks.",1.0
great product! it makes your skin glow and pores smaller!.,1.0
"I use the Cicapair Tiger Grass serum and absolutely love it, so I was very excited when I bought this product to try. However, it made me oily throughout the day, didn’t cover blemishes like I wanted it to, and it did not go on smoothly. However, it did decrease my redness so that was definitely a plus!",0.0
"Heavenly orange smell. I received this as a gift, and was delighted to use. Went on creamy, but absorbed quickly and well. Non-greasy. Didn’t notice any particular wizard-like effects on my skin, but just lovely to apply.",1.0

"I really like their lip mask, the one in the jar. I bought this thinking it’s the same but in a squeeze tube form. It’s not. This is more of a glossy balm, which I like but it did not last long on the lips, therefore did not moisturize my lips. I wouldn’t repurchase again.",0.0

"I got this product in the birthday gift pack that Sephora offers for free. I decided to put it on when doing my makeup for dinner and had to wipe my entire base off and redo it. This primer was awful. It pilled so badly I had stuff in my hair and eyebrows, and it made the spots I tried to conceal very patchy. For transparency, I did my skincare routine before using the primer (face wash and ninacinimide). I had left that to dry for about 15 minutes before applying the product. My other primers have not done this even when I used the same skincare routine. For the price point, I would expect much better.",0.0
"I decided to splurge on this and I’m glad I did. This felt so luxurious and unique. Viscous gel like texture with the rice making it a bit grainy but still smooth. It’s so soothing, I look forward to washing my face with this. It makes my skin so baby soft and clean.",1.0
"It’s amazing! Feels really good, removes makeup well and leaves skin soft and clean.",1.0
the product overall is amazing but it’s so tiny and WAY overpriced. i also went through it way too fast. had it less than a month (not even using it daily) and it’s already gone. less expensive lip balms work just as well for me,0.0
Cleared up my acne in a day... I have combination/Oily/Sensitive skin (this is more for dry skin) I’ve had horrible acne for almost two years.. it was so bad even the dermatologist couldn’t fix it!!! Highly recommend,1.0
"I’ve used this product off and on for about 2 years and previously I always felt like it dried my skin out more than provided any deep hydration. I learned that because I live in the desert, I need an occlusive to follow any product I use with hyaluronic acid in it. So now I follow it up with Sqaulane and it helps my skin retain its own moisture. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1.0
I tried this product for a few weeks before this review. It stands true to its claim of “blurring” huge pores while also hydrating my skin (which is rare as creams minimizing pores tend to be harsh on skin). It went on really smooth and was very lightweight which I adored. I think this would be a great daily cream to use in warmer spring/summer months!I received this product complimentary or influenster in exchange for my honest feedback.,1.0
Nice packaging didn’t feel cheap at all...the product itself for some reason clogged my pores a bit and caused blemishes...,0.0
"I have normal skin that often lacks moisture even after using lotions. Nothing seemed to really give me that moisture and dew I was looking for until I found this. It’s such a great price, lasts a long time, and very easy to use even all over the body. Just try it. It’s amazing.",1.0
"Inkey List is a regular part of my skincare routine so I’m bummed this cleanser didn’t hold up to my expectations. It left my face with an oily film feeling for several days after one use, clogged my pores and didn’t offer a “clean” feeling whatsoever. Felt like I rubbed vaseline on my face. I have relatively clear, combination skin that doesn’t get irritated easily. I’ll definitely be returning.",0.0
Was excited to try this product as I’m looking for a good quality eye cream. After only a few days of use I started to have develop dryness of under-eye skin and stopped using. I never have dry skin in that spot and knew it was due to the the new product. Did not attempt to use it again.,0.0
I use this as a daily moisturizer and trust me my skin is DRY but this helps with that! Smells so good and gives my skin a glowing finish! I received this complimentary from influenster. I would totally recommend!,1.0
"I have been using this, one pump AM/PM for about 3 weeks.  This is a nice serum.  I enjoy the scent and how it feels on my skin.  My skin is looking more even toned.  The “shine“ it gives you only lasts about an hour, and it looks the same as rubbing a bit of cheap hair gel on the skin.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting something really spectacular. This is a nice niacinamide serum and I enjoy it, but I’m going to investigate some less expensive niacinamide serums as I purchased this for the “instant glow“ and it doesn’t deliver on that front.  Pictured are two swatches.  The one on the left is cheap hair gel, the one on the right is the Watermelon Dew Drops.",1.0
Great cleansing balm for double cleanse. I couldn’t believe the amount of makeup and gunk that it removed from my face. Truly the first pre cleanse product I’ve used that I feel like really gets absolutely everything off my face after having worn makeup all day/night. Love the little scoop they include to get the perfect amount each time. 10/10!,1.0
"Incredible hydrating solution for my dry, sensitive skin. Highly recommend! This has become a staple in my cabinet and holy grail lotion for winter months or year round. It is a bit thick, just a heads up, but doesn’t make my skin react or breakout. I also use this as a body lotion when I need extra hydration.",1.0

"I have oily acne prone skin, I tried a sample of it, it breaks me out everytime I use it. So it worth 0 star for my skin.But I like anyother aspect of this product, my skin looks brighter the next morning.

"I was SO excited to try this since I love this brand and the Tatcha Rice Polish is one of my staples.

Cleanser itself is very refreshing.",0.0
"I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. Overall, a fantastic product with good results! The cream is light, absorbs well, and has a faint orange scent. I found it layered nicely under other skincare and makeup. It did brighten and even my skin, but had similar effects to my other vitamin c serums. While this is a great product, I personally think the price tag is too high for me to use it on a regular basis.",0.0
"After being given a complimentary bottle of this moisturizer from Fresh I have really liked it. It leaves my skin very soft and glowing.

"I know this is long. Trust me, it’s worth the read. I’ve been using retinol to clear my acne, and anyone who knows anything about retinol it is unforgiving and dries your skin up like a raisin before it starts to work. so my skin was in desperate need of hydration. I have normal to oily skin but because of the retinol, I have dry, irritated, and cracking patches all over my skin (mostly all around my nose, my chin, and my forehead.) I used this only on my cheeks and nose after cleansing and toning, and then put my moisturizer on top and woke up with NO dry patches or any irritation! It felt smooth and my skin was no longer red and uncomfortably tight. On my forehead (where I didn’t put the product so I could test the benefits) it felt dry and stiff, this product definitely works! If you have dry skin, it is not an immediate fix for dehydration. but it sinks into your skin and works from within, leaving you hydrated and fixing your dry patches. It’s also a good thing to note that I usually break out from things that are too intense and this did not break me out or feel heavy on the skin (gel like consistency). try this out, you’ll fall in love.",1.0

This product was complimentary from dermalogica and Wow! I’ve used many exfoliants and they do not compare to this. This is very soft to use on a daily basis which really cleans and exfoliates your skin- and not only on your face. This stuff is great to exfoliate any part of the body that might need it. My skin has cleared up so much! Highly recommend.,1.0
"For the money I think it’s great. It has definitely reduced my puffiness and dark circles. It’s not perfect for me anyway but at that price point I love it. I will definitely be looking for a good eye cream to help further reduce the puffiness and dark circles but this has been a good start as I start to take my skin care more seriously. It only takes a drop to do both eyes so one bottle is going to last me forever. I have attached two pictures, one is before I started using it with my “morning face“ and one is after 2 weeks of use.",1.0
"this product does not hydrate your skin at all. I have very dry skin and this seemed like the perfect fit as said in the description and also recommended by a Sephora employee, but it seemed to have made my dry patches even more dry i swear it doesn’t hydrate at all. do not get this product if your skin is dry, it will make it worse.",0.0
Loved this product - it is really hydrating but effective. If you are prone to redness just be careful with following up with strong retinol products or vitamin C as this really gets the job done in terms of exfoliation. I used the banana cream after to soothe the skin and woke up with pretty wonderful looking skin! FYI texture is very reminiscent of snail mucin products which I love!,1.0
I have always had a hard time finding a product that will get rid of or help the bags and dark circles under my eyes. I personally didn’t have any luck with this product. It also made my skin look oily and I don’t wear makeup so that was kind of a problem for my already oily skin.,0.0

"The gold spatula changed my life - I can’t believe I was sticking my heathen fingers in other creams before this product. The product smells luxurious, even though fragrance isn’t a good thing. I will gladly admit that I love the cooling cream-to-watery-gel sensation of applying this product, but after 4 months it didn’t do anything special or improve my skin in any way. I got much better results from a drug store water cream. Going to reuse this adorb container with the fancy gold spatula and refill it with that cheap but effective drugstore gel cream. Needless to say, I won’t be repurchasing this product. Used with Tatcha Essence and Vitamin C serum.",0.0
"*This was Gifted by Glow Recipe but the opinion is completely my own.* My skin looked so hydrated and dewy after the 1st use, it gave me instant healthy-looking skin. I love that it doubles as a primer, it works amazingly helping my skin look even and smoother, I can see it helping blur out my large pores the instant I put it on. I’m a big fan of the liquidy texture and it smells gorgeous!! (I literally was to drink this!) the only thing I’m not a big fan of is it leaves my skin feeling a little sticky afterward, I have mixed feelings about this because my skin absorbs it super fast but I still have to wait a while for the stickiness to go away, so if you don’t mind waiting for a little extra, to me this is perfect! I have combination skin and it can be a nightmare sometimes, my dry areas are scaly dry but my T zone is a disco ball, so its really hard for me to find a moisturizer that can not only hydrate my dry areas but that is also not going to make me shiny throughout the day, and this does exactly that! So far I’m loving it but I will say I am in South Texas and we hardly get cold days, I suspect this won’t be as hydrating for those winter days but we shall see.",1.0
"The best serum i have ever used- and ive tried eeeeeverything to get rid of my dehydrated skin. This not only leaves my face feeling soft and healthy immediately instead of greasy and oily as a lot of serums do but it just makes the skin perfect. The amount of time and love spent on every ingredient really shows and does the attention spent of the bottle- literally zero waste, zero mess. I use this in conjunction with clarins’ remarkable line of moisturizers and I don’t think ill ever stray from it. As with most skincare i do suggest that you not forget to do the serum twice a day for the healthiest results!",1.0
"I’m very disappointed. I thought this would give me great hydration and it’s doing the complete opposite. My nose and forehead is peeling like crazy and around my acne is flaky which hasn’t happened in a long time. It’s also causing me acne because I feel dry when applied especially around my nose, eyes and cheeks. So then I have to double apply which is probably clogging my pores. I didn’t like it personally I fell like it’s not meant for my skin.",0.0
This didn’t work for my cystic acne. I’ve used it a couple times but I find if it does work it just turns it into a massive dry bump that looks worse than before. Won’t be repurchasing and will probably return.,0.0
This was not a win for me. I have super dry skin and was hoping this would work for me but as soon as I switched from a different cream to this my skin appeared so much more dry and flakey. I would recommend this to maybe someone with oily or normal skin but this is definitely not for dry skin.,0.0

"I got this as a sample size, twice just to be sure. The smell is nice but a little on the strong side for my liking. The texture from the sample reminded me of sour milk (best way to describe it!). My skin soaked it in. It felt so nice going on. Then, it felt like my skin tightened and areas of my face became very hot and red to the touch. For better or worse I left it on though and the redness did go away. I did get some weird pilling of the moisturizer that is hard to explain but basically it caked off in some areas.  My skin felt nice all day (didn’t try this with any makeup on). I just don’t think I can use this one. The smell did linger in case that would bother anyone!",0.0

My acne started clearing up right away.  It feels a little dry after you use it but I bought the water cream and apply that after. It’s the perfect combo. This is my favorite cleanser ever.,1.0
"I wanted to love it, thankfully I got the mini size. I little goes a long way. However it didn’t do much on the exfoliating part. It just felt like the product was rubbing its own self against my skin. My skin still felt the same as of pre-wash. It was pretty disappointing, but hey I used it on my body as a scrub, just so I don’t feel like I wasted money on soapy gummy paste.",0.0
Great product. The texture is light weight but doesn’t stop it from being effective.,1.0
I received this wrinkle correcting serum to use for free in exchange for my honest opinion and I really like it. It’s easy to use and is applied smoothly onto the skin. It absorbs quickly and really helped nourish and smooth my skin. My dry skin looks plump and my face looks and feels fresh and younger.,1.0
"I just completed the first week of the Estee Lauder Night Repair Serum. I used it both atit is a  night and morning for a week. I continued my normal skin care routine as it is suggested to use your normal moisturizer once the product has absorbed.  I have drier skin and needed the added hydration. However, you may not need it if you have a different skin type. I received a one week sample complementary in return for my honest review. During the week i didnt notice a measurable difference.  My skin did stay hydrated. It would be interesting to see the longer term results as they said it takes 3-4 weeks to see the best results. It is a little pricey for the results delivered.  #GenerationANR #contest #complimentary @esteelauder @Influenster",0.0
"While this does take off all your makeup the film it leaves on your skin is greasy and unpleasant. I gave this product a good try (2 months) as I loved the routine of removing my makeup this way, but it is definitely necessary to double cleanse, which can be annoying. Ultimately, I ended up throwing this product out as I was breaking out EVERYWHERE with really painful, hard to get rid of cystic acne.",0.0
"I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin. So I wash my face using the triple cleanse method every night. Exfoliating my face every night is a must to clean out my pores, but finding a daily exfoliator that isn’t too harsh on your skin is nearly impossible. I have been using this daily exfoliating powder for over a year and it has saved my skin! I use it every night and my sebum production has decreased drastically and my skin is so smooth!",1.0
"used this product for a little over a month. Skin started breaking out progressively after i started using this product. Made my skin so much worse and I am so disappointed as it cost me $90. When i realized it was this product causing me to have 7 new breakouts in a few days, i discontinued use. After a few days of not using it my skin is calming down.",0.0
"I’m a big fan of Caudalie products. Most of my skincare is made up of it. This serum has quickly become a favorite. It’s very smooth and feels luxurious.

"I fell in love with the Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask, but this one is so much more affordable and the associates at my local Sephora highly recommended it.  I’ve actually tried it two separate time, the second time hoping I’d judged it too harshly the first time, and both times it proved disappointing.  It feels good while it’s on, and I like how it rinses off, but it didn’t have any of the positive effects I notice from my Tata Harper one, and it majorly made me break out.  The second go-around, I was suspicious whether this was really the cause, so I stopped using it, waiting for my breakout to clear up, and then weeks later used it again, and the next day, breakout again.  So, understanding everyone’s skin is different, but for my skin, this just doesn’t cut it.",0.0

"My under eye area has been looking very wrinkly and dehydrated, as I tend to neglect it.  I figured there was nothing that could improve its appearance, plastic surgery not withstanding.  I used this eye cream last night, and honest as I can be, the skin was plumped up and had far less wrinkles!  I wish I’d taken a picture to compare, but I don’t want to stop using it in order to do that!",1.0
I received a 7 day sample and noticed such a difference already! My skin is all around smoother and not as dry. I wake up with smooth skin in the morning and don’t have to worry about slathering on a bunch of moisturizer in the morning.,1.0
I will repurchase this item over and over and over again. It is amazing. Seriously the best face wash I have ever used. My skin loves me for this purchase. It pairs so nicely with my moisturizer and serum. Love love love.,1.0
It doesnt do anything. I have very dry skin. I left the mask on over night. Most of the cream still on my face and didnt do anything. It was totally waste of money. Any $2 sheet mask could work better than this.,0.0

"I love peels because my cosmetologist advised it to me and I really see effect from them. But not from this one, unfortunately.I have received it for free to test. You can use it only once a week. So I cleaned my face and applied the peel. It’s very easy to apply it because of the pad. After 15 min I used my moisture cream (which is ok by the instructions).In the morning I washed my face and was disappointed because my pores were more noticeable as usual and they were dirty. Usually peel hide the pores (based on my previous experience). But not this one. I wouldn’t recommend it.",0.0

"I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my honest review from #trywithtopbox, and I am unsure of the full benefits of this product, as I only got a sachet sample with enough for two applications. That being said, I liked the texture of this product, as it was not tacky or greasy, but I found it took awhile to fully absorb into my eyelids. I used this in tandem with 2 other clinique wrinkle repair samples, but just found there were no physical changes to the faint lines on my face or around my eyes. Overall, an ok product, but would need to try more to see extensive benefits.",0.0
"This cream is perfect for my extremely dry face!I noticed a difference in my skin immediately after applying. My face now looks hydrated and haven’t had a dry flake anywhere. Also, the redness on my cheeks has been reduced significantly.I would say tho that this cream seems for very dry skin, so now I’m having to reduce the usage to once a day to avoid breakouts. Even when applied once a day this cream LASTS.",1.0

"I’m surprised this has the reviews it does. Let’s start with the positive. The only one I can think of is it smells really nice. But as far as taking off makeup, I always have to clean my face again after using this. It does nothing for mascara but smudges it all over my face and it slightly blinds me when I use it on my eyes. My vision is usually blurry for about 30 seconds. This is concerning to say the least. I would say get a nice cleanser instead since you’ll need to wash your face again anyways to remove your makeup.",0.0
This is not for dry skin. It is not hydrating at all and it smells bad. It’s more of a gel than a cream to me.,0.0

I let them sit because I had a ton of other moisturizers, but today I decided to use this after the 2 step Erno Vitamin Peel &my skin felt absolutely amazing afterwards!!

"Love these! I cut them in half and store the rest in a washable-plastic bag with a little bit of water, to prevent them from drying out. What I don’t like is that Dr. Dennis Gross doesn’t list the percentages of AHA’s or BHA’s like most brands do. Knocked off a star for that. These are definitely a splurge, but worth it. I use about 3x/week.",1.0

"I didn’t expect too much from this Sunscreen stick, I don’t know if it is for the form or because to be honest I never heard about this brand, but by the end I liked it, I like its texture and how its smell because it doesn’t feel that it is a sunscreen. I have to say that I feel it a little bit oily so for that reason I don’t think I will use it on my face.I like its shape, easy to carry and apply.",1.0
"I tried this via the Sephora birthday gift. After the Drunk Elephant social media person turned me off the brand with their rude comments to people who -- politely -- said they were having problems with the products, I decided I should at least give them a fair chance and try it for myself.I have combination skin, even in the summer, with a few patches of texture and t-zone pores prone to clog. This moisturizer helps with all of that, giving me soft, smooth skin and smaller pores, but I still wouldn’t buy it. The packaging feels like a baby toy and the smell reminds me of an octogenarian’s lotion. It’s also extremely thick, so even though it absorbs quickly, it feels tacky putting it on. At this expensive it definitely isn’t worth it for me.",0.0
"Beautiful Lip Product. I never ever go to bed without something on my lips. I have been this way since my teens. All day, I have to have lipstick or gloss or balm on.This lip mask has changed that.

I was a little disappointed in the results I had using the advance night repair serum. In my experience with this serum it did make my skin look plump and hydrated but only for so long until my dry spots were looking quite dull and dry again. I used this AM/PM as the application process recommended. I usually don’t have to use much with my regular serums and I seemed to have to use more than I usually do with this one. After not even 24 hours I did start breaking out and it persisted as long as I used the serum which I had high hopes that I wouldn’t seeing it says it’s supposed to be Non-acnegenic. I can’t vouch for the other benefits it’s supposed to have since I only used it for not even the full week before I ran out of serum. I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.,0.0
"Smells light and yummy. The jar was full, unlike the Yerba Mate mask I bought with it, thank goodness. The texture is creamy, kind of whipped so it makes it easy to spread. Very hydrating and I definitely noticed a glow in my skin the next morning. I find that YTTP products work better together. This is now my current night cream!",1.0

"I would really love to give this a 5 stars since it’s amazing when it comes to taking off makeup. it took off my lash glue easily! however my skin reacted really badly to it. broke me out very badly, I tried using it a couple more times on different occasions but it was the same. last time I used it, it somewhat gave me a boil of some kind. my skin is sensitive, so that could be the reason. i still say buy a small size and give it a go since it still is an amazing product... to bad my face hated it x.x I posted photos of what happened, that giant red dot below my eye is the boil type thing ): i normally have good skin but this wasnt having it x.x all the red dots are from that unfortunately....",1.0

Got this for my boyfriend to try out since his face gets super oily and sometimes breakouts. It does help to reduce the oiliness but other than that it doesn’t really do much. It does feel drying after applying it (I’m guessing it’s supposed to mattifying the skin?) so I recommend using a good moisturizer after that.,1.0

"This stuff is fantastic. I made sure to read a bunch of reviews on multiple websites, as well as The Ordinary’s instructions on their official site, and it completely works. My skin was getting weirdly dull and dry this winter, pores looking a mess too, and using this every other night works! I definitely diluted it with moisturizer the first few tries, but now my skin has no issues with direct application. Layering this under the 2% retinoid product, Indie Lee Squalane oil, and a good moisturizer has brought my skin back to life. I’m going to be buying this forever as far as I’m concerned.",1.0
"Confidence in a Cream is one of the most effective moisturizers I have ever experienced.  My skin is very prone to acne and redness after shaving.  Upon applying this cream, it mitigates the irritation and makes my skin very smooth and cool.  My skin stays smooth throughout the day and the addition of anti-aging ingredients makes this a superior product to use every day to keep your skin smooth and supple.  Since my skin is mostly dry, the Confidence Cream gives it the required moisture without leaving a greasy and sticky base on your skin.  It applies very well and highly recommend this cream to folks who have dry skin subject to constant irritation and redness.  You will see results that will make your skin soft and smooth.  I also like that the cream’s scent is very subtle and not over-bearing yet very pleasant.  The “Confidence in a Cream” is an outstanding product and I give it a 5-STAR Rating.",1.0
"My skin is much more even in tone and much, much softer. It provides light, even coverage with and unmatched hydration that lasts all day without becoming oily.

"I recently received a sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling of their Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator. It produces a creamy foam with a mild, fresh scent. The beads in it are very gentle, and I’ve gotten no scrapes or scratches at all. Per the directions, I also tested leaving it on an extra minute for additional brightening, and though the handful of times I tried it wasn’t enough to make a huge difference, I can report I had zero irritation. The chemical exfoliation is gentle, as well, and while I don’t see any extreme or dramatic results as far as brightening, my skin is noticeably softer and smoother after a week of use. It’s so gentle I’m able to use it twice a day without no reaction. I will note that though this exfoliant is meant to be used after washing, the foaming action does have a bit of a cleansing effect, so I do sometimes feel a bit dry. The feeling goes away completely with the rest of my usual routine, but I might require some additional moisture while using it come winter. Overall, this is a nice, gentle exfoliant that provides results without irritation.",1.0

"Just stick with your regular liquid makeup remover or better yet, a micellar water. This is by far the worst thing I have ever tried. For eye makeup this texture is not convenient at all, you have to put that solid thing on your eyelashes to remove mascara and it burns. Also, the reason why i bought it in first place is because I thought it would hydrate my face a bit, and instead, once you clean it, you basically have to do your skin care immediately because it leaves your face extremely dry to the point where you feel your face breaks and also a weird wax like feeling. I still have no idea what the benefit is, the IT Miracle Water is by far better than this. Im returning this and buying my second bottle of Miracle Water instead. It’s cleaner and it won’t give you that weird eye swollen ball because of all the bacteria in there. I thought I was the only one but nope!",0.0

they are much softer than regular cotton rounds and feel nicer on the skin. I also like that you get over 100 sheets. Its worth it for me since I wear makeup almost everyday and use these to separately remove my eye makeup.,1.0

"The OG with a beautiful pearl sheen. It works so well with my cool undertones.  My skin is light to medium so I was worried this color may be too light for me. It is not! It does not give me a white cast, but just an ethereal glow. It’s so beautiful when the sun hits the high points of the face. I’ll wear it by itself most of the time, but it doubles well as a primer for me and my makeup goes on evenly over it.   It has Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin B5 for long lasting hydration which is a staple in my routine. The Niacinamide Helps reduce the size of my pores and discolorations.

I started seeing that my skin was producing more oils than normal (related to a hormone imbalance) and I was previously trying to combat that with actives that DID NOT WORK. Turns out that massaging my skin for about 5 minutes with Green Clean not only removed my makeup, but brought to surface sebaceous filaments that were previously clogging my pores and causing irritation/acne.

I purchased this because I was breaking out more than usual on my bottom check I purchased the mini kit to see how I would like it . I used it for 2 days the first day I saw my acne definitely cleared up but when I woke up the second day my eyes were puffy and the left check felt like sand paper . If you use clean products stay with that because this definitely never happened before and caused such a reaction to my skin,0.0

"I found this moisturizer to be particularly hydrating. I used it as a daily moisturizer and it worked well under makeup. I received a sample size which was used up in a few days, I didn’t notice any dramatic results in that time - but that could be attributable to the short span of usage. One thing to note, this moisturizer is highly fragrant. It’s a very pleasant scent and I found it enjoyable, but important to note as fragrance in skincare products isn’t something everyone loves.",1.0

"I bought this product for my pimples after developing quite the acne spot from constant use of masks and especially the humidity and sweatiness while wearing them in the summer. I would best describe my skin as: quite sensitive, oily on the T-zone (especially my nose), normal every where else, pimple prone on the outer cheeks and a bit every where else, has discolouration, around mouth and chin, doesn’t tolerate a lot of product and a lot of steps, may be dehydrated.I would say this if I had to describe the product and it’s effects on me: a daily exfoliating and repairing treatment that penetrates the skin and helps accelerate the natural cell turnover of my skin, deeply cleans pores, reduces and stables oil production and leaves my skin more radiant and even looking. How I use this product at night: I double cleanse with an oil based cleanser, wipe my face dry, apply step 1, wait 2 min, apply step 2, wait 2 min, apply moisturizer. The product does sting a little bit and may make your face more red for a min and pimples more apparent when applying, but the redness of the pimples should go down after a nights rest. Now I will say this, this is in no way a miracle product (though it impresses me quite a bit), you have to be consistent and keep using it for your pimples to go down and keep buying it again. In no way will it clear your skin after 1-2 weeks of use that is just asking for the impossible (I use them every other day). Take your budget into account, because it is quite expensive. You may be looking at a 6 weeks+ for clearing skin and really getting the full effect (and it depends on your acne and skin condition) look at it realistically and you won’t be let down.  A money saving tip is to cut the product in half and seal the rest (half is enough trust me) I cannot recommend this product as every skin is different and you know best what fits it, but I would say to try the 5 packs to see what strength is good for you.",0.0
"There are a lot of pimple patches put there. I have some faves and this is one of them. It’s not just the colloidal patch but it has salicylic acid n vitamin A and aloe Vera so it’s soothing yet still pretty strong. It doesn’t burn my skin or where I popped my pimple. Yes I still do and probably will always pop em. I find that with any patch, this works best on pimples that are popped. Doesn’t do a terrible job on I popped but better after the pop nonetheless. These are my go to patch for the cystic acne or if I didn’t get the ick out. Let’s be real, there’s always something left behind. I don’t need these for more than 3 nights for a big cystic type and maybe a cool of nights for the Lil guys. The others will work on some but when they don’t, I just wear these at night. If I’m home then during the day too. I think this is a great lil patch and it is a staple. I have bought at least 6 boxes over the past couple of years. The maskne was ridiculous. You won’t know unless you try.",1.0

"In torn. I love DE and most of their products. But this stuff broke me out big time. It stinks, but takes my makeup off well. But it leaves this film on your face and it feels gross. Broke me out after 2 days. Love the packaging and idea behind the product. But didn’t work for me.",0.0
Amazing product! I could notice the transformation after the first use!,1.0
"Purchased this product during quarantine because I figured it would be a safe time to try out a new tan. All I can say is I am so glad I bought it during this time when I won’t be going out in public because oh-boy this is bad. I did 8 pumps for every 5 pumps of lotion to get a deeper tan and not only do I look like an Oompa Loompa, but a patchy one.  The pigment is very orange, and I noticed that the tan is deeper in some places and lighter in others. No thanks, I’ll be going back to my tanning mousse.",0.0
Love it!! It applies smoothly and preps my skin for a smooth foundation application. I highly recommend this product,1.0
"This stuff is gold for my skin! I’ve been on a mission to convert all skincare to clean beauty and this one is a winner. I was not super sure at first, because I was put off by the color but I quickly got over it. alot of moisturizers for dry to combo skin can leave me looking like I’ve slathered myself in jelly but this one soaks right in, feels great and doesn’t make me look like a dolphin! I just wish they’d come out with a sunscreen version. I use it after a face essence and my serums, but prior to my sunscreen. if I’m not heading out, I’ll obviously just skip the sunscreen and rock this for my all inside days.",1.0
It works like it’s suppose to. Takes all the makeup off but I cringe each time I have to use it because it will make your vision soooo blurry for a few minutes after you use it.,0.0
"This is a fabulous moisturizer!! It’s pretty thick which is the most negative thing about it, however it really absorbs into my skin quickly and lasts all day long. It definitely gives my skin a great boost. I also love to mix it with the Framboos. With doing that breaks down the thickness and moisturizers while shrinking my pores at the same time. I also like the container since you push down on the top and it gives you an alotted amount to use, so no waste. Highly recommend!!!",1.0
Leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. Apply with a cotton ball and simply sweep over your face.,1.0
this product dries out your skin.. It also feels like your skin does not absorb it. It just sits on top of your skin..,0.0

"I received this product as part of a promotion with Influenster for my honest review. I have tried so many lip masks and this one is intensively hydrating, feels so comfortable on the lips and has a light scent, I would definitely purchase this because I noticed how great my lips looked after using for just a few nights.",1.0
"For the price, this is a pretty good product.  It has  a very light, thin texture. and goes on smooth. I have not noticed any major  changes,  but my eyes do feel more moisturized.",1.0
"I was recommended this as “a better Mario Badescu“ spot treatment. I can’t say that it is better, nor worse. And I can’t say it doesn’t work. It dries out pimples if you’re consistent with applying. BUT this product comes off during my sleep when I need it to be doing it’s job. I’m sticking to pimple patches, they never come off and the pimple is like guaranteed to be gone in the morning with the stickers, esp whiteheads.",0.0
Helps with dry under eye,1.0
"Ok so I started off LOVING this because it made my lips feel noticeably soft in the mornings after applying it at night. I have super dry lips and have tried so many different lip balms, and this worked the best for me. My lips drank it up, it didn’t feel tacky, it smelled amazing, etc. HOWEVER, after about more than a month of consistent use, I realized that its effects weren’t as obvious on my lips anymore, and my lips were in fact feeling very dry. No matter how much of this I applied, it just stopped working for me and my lips were like dehydrated?? I checked up the ingredients in this and found that it contains ALCOHOL. I’m not sure if this is the exact culprit, but I’m not going to be repurchasing because this is just not an ingredient I would want in any of my long-term skincare products. Please consider it before you buy this guys!!",0.0
"I REALLY wanted to love this....like really really... the scent is amazing, and I truly enjoyed the way it performed and made my face feel when clean. I looked forward to cleansing, it was that nice....but unfortunately this product broke me out pretty bad, twice. In Jan I started switching all of my products over to “Clean at Sephora“ brands. I had originally bought this as the travel set with the mini Water Cream, along with some of the DE day",1.0
Love this product enough to get a refill!,1.0
"I want to love this product but, ah, it just didn’t give me the results I hoped for. I have combo skin that is somewhat sensitive (not ultra sensitive, but it just dries out when it doesn’t like what I’m doing), and acne prone. That said, this cleanser didn’t dry out my skin! So that’s good, but I didn’t feel like it cleaned deep enough for what I personally need in a daily cleanser, so -1 star for that. -1 more star because I think it smells weird! My friend smelled it as well and agreed. Is it supposed to be “Cantaloupe“ scented? I used a whole bottle and still don’t know, but if it is, that’s not even really a scent I’m into anyway, so maybe that’s the issue.",0.0
"I have very resilient skin than rarely reacts negatively to skin products. I used this product as an exfoliating cleanser ONE time, didn’t even use it as a mask. The next morning I woke up in a complete breakout. I have never broken out like this before, red bumps everywhere. And my skin is SO dry. I love other products from this brand, but this one is just not for me. Be careful!",0.0
Didn’t like this. The niacinamide is nice but doesn’t make it worth $45 or worth the pilling. This was a return for me.,0.0
I’ve used this serum for years! It feels so good and has improved my skin! I sometimes use it in the Morning as a prep for makeup. It has helped my texture overall and gives a glowing complexion!,1.0
"I was super excited for this product because I love the tatcha deep cleansing one, and the ingredients are clean. I also love their rice polishing powder so I was expecting good things. It has a really nice smooth lather and great texture and doesn’t leave your skin feeling stripped or dry. Unfortunately, it gave me types of pimples I’ve never had before (like oily, it was weird) in places I’ve never had breakouts before. I have combo skin.",0.0
"I received a sample of this product free to try in exchange for my honest review. I immediately noticed the pleasant scent of this product when I opened the container. This cream is so hydrating and perfect for these cold winter months. Even though it was very moisturizing, it didn’t seem heavy on the skin. It applies evenly and works well under makeup. I’ve been using for about a week and have noticed a slight improvement on the appearances of my pores. Overall, great product, and I highly recommend.",1.0
"I received Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel to try from PinchMe. I am SO happy I did! I love the way my face feel. I followed the instructions, and erred on the conservative side. I used it ever other day. My face was brighter and more even immediately. I don’t usually change my skin care routine, but I have absolutely added this!",1.0
"I purchased after reading great reviews, but it wasn’t what I expected. It’s basicly a moisturizer that you can remove or leave on. In addition, it’s a bit on the oily side. If I were jet lagged, this would not be the mask I’d like to use. I won’t purchase again.",0.0
Have been using this for a year now and it’s made a huge difference! More even skin tone. I still have hyperpigmentation but this product has done its job when it comes to break outs. Use this and alpha arbutin at night. Skin care newbie and still learning how to clear my skin up,1.0
"Not worth it. It felt so good to put on initially, but I found my skin was super thirsty after applying it 30 mins later. I bought the full size and it only lasted me 6 weeks! I ended up switching to a better product at a fraction of the cost. Aside from the super luxe packaging, there really isn’t anything special about this product.",0.0
This product was gifted to me by Glow Recipe. I loved this product under my makeup. Left my skin with a beautiful glow and my makeup lasted all night. I didn’t use any other primer with it and my makeup was set. I’ve also used it alone and it looks great as well. It smells amazing!,1.0
i have dry sensitive skin and i purchased a skincare favorites bag. It was inside. When i first tried it (without knowing that it’s not a good thing for my skin type) i used it to clean and wipe off some of my makeup. it had a stinging sensation and it really hurt. i thought i would have gotten a allergic reaction.,0.0

"DE makes fantastic products that deliver on results, especially over time. This eye cream unfortunately caused irritation and red bumps under my eyes that cleared up when I stopped using it. Not sure why, maybe it was because of the higher concentration of vitamin C. I have never had a reaction to any other DE product and will continue to use their other products I’ve come to love, but this one just didn’t work for me.",0.0
The first vitamin c serum I have purchased. Got it because of the price point. It’s not anything special. I found it to be on the sticky side. It smells nice but I will be exchanging it for another serum.,0.0
"I AM IN LOVE! I have old acne scars and dark spots, but after using this for a week, my skin looks much more clearer and healthier. My old acne scars seems to fade a lot. I’ve been trying gycolic serums from other brands but this works the best! It’s expensive but worth it if you have acne scars like me, this is worth everything. The downside however is avoid areas where you tend to dry most. For me it’s tip of my nose so i avoid that area when applying this",1.0
I loved the texture but I don’t think it’s compatible for sensitive skin,0.0
Don’t like this it doesn’t melt into the skin it sits on top. It is very thick and feels very heavy on the face. It’s also expensive you can find a better product at a drugstore for a fraction of the price.,0.0

They are struggling with their nose...I’ll try and leave feed back once that is under control!",1.0
Overall I thought thia was a pretty good product. It went on smoothly and easy and didn’t feel heavy or greasy. It did seem to help my under eye area and I would recommend it.,1.0
so honestly… it could be just me. but this product did nothing for me. i wasn’t really looking for anything for fine lines or dark circles but i really just needed something to hydrate my under eyes so i decided to try this since i like the kiehls moisturizer. but thjs product did absolutely nothing for me. im also on accutane so my skin is bone dry right now but for the price i don’t think a little hydration is too much to ask for.,0.0
I got this with their new oily skin hydrator & it makes my skin so oily after use even when using them together,0.0
I really like the formula when it first goes on but it doesn’t seem to last more than a couple hours and I haven’t noticed any overall change in my lips. I’ve tried a handful of other products that are a bigger bang for my buck and work better hence why the 3 stars. If you’re curious I highly suggest trying it in store first to see what you think. I won’t be returning it because it’s still decent but I definitely won’t be purchasing it again.,0.0
"I thought people overhyped this product, but I couldn’t be more wrong. Having used more cleansers than I can count (both expensive and drugstore brands), I really wasn’t expecting much from this... But my oily skin loves it! One of the very few cleansers that don’t dry out my skin at all, and it’s even made the bumps on my forehead disappear! It foams a lot too, so I only use half a pump (which helps make it last longer). It smells fresh and not like fragrances that are too overpowering or chemical-like. It’s only been about a week but I’m already noticing my dark spots are fading, and my face feels more hydrated and plump after every wash. Would highly recommend giving this a try (but would suggest getting the mini-size first considering its on the expensive side)",1.0
"Little did I know, this item has Moringa!! To start off, I’m a huge superfood nerd. I didn’t know this item has moringa when I first started using it. Since I have a combination skin, I tend to not put facial cream on my t-zone unless it’s gel or serum. Nevertheless, the result of this facial cream on my cheeks was phenomenal… my skin feels so plump and the cream gave this instant glow. I love how it wasn’t oily, but instead it left my skin velvety soft. Once I found out it has moringa, I applied it on my entire face. I love how it hydrates my skin without being greasy. And it didn’t break me out either! I had a love-hate relationship with facial cream, but this is now my go-to facial cream. Definitely a superfood your skin loves.",1.0
Best cleansing balm out there! This balm effectively melts my makeup off better than any other product I have tired. I do recommend following up with a second cleanser to make sure your skin is squeaky clean.,1.0

"I really wanted to like this product because I really enjoyed the Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped cream. However, it clogged my pores after a few uses and changed the texture of my skin. It definitely isn’t a moisturizing cream for a smooth finish. But with the right combination of products it may work better. It just wasn’t for me.",0.0
I’ve been using this product for a little over a month. My toner started to burn after I used this product. I’ve been using the same toner for a year now without issues (The Ordinary). I did some research and this product was causing micro tears in my skin causing my toner to burn a lot. It does have a nice smell but that’s about it. I won’t be using this product again.,0.0
I’ve been using this as my night time toner for the last nearly 6 months (note: im barely running out) & i just absolutely love it. My chin was a dark spot circus before this. I can honestly say that this is probably a forever purchase until i get my acne fully under control. Just purchased the jumbo size and i can’t wait until it gets here!,1.0
"Texture goes on smoothly and feels light on my skin while still hydrating. It didn’t have much smell which I appreciate. I use it every evening and morning after washing my face.While I loved it, I gave it 4 stars because it is expensive and I think there are cheaper alternatives that work as well.I received this product free of charge but the opinions are my own.",1.0
I love this cleanser... and then THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA ON US YALL! Added fragrance to it with a ton of other new ingredients! So so so freaking mad!,0.0
"Not worth the money. Barely noticed a difference! I wanted to like it but i felt like my skin still needed some moisture, and that’s coming from someone with combination to oily skin haha. Good consistency though for a mask :) not too thick, not too thin.",0.0

I gave this a 4 star because my pump came broke it didn’t work and also this face wash doesn’t do anything for my skin for the price I could’ve bought something else it’s way to high not to do anything,0.0
I really like the Bobby Brown moisturizer. I love applying this after my shower or before my make up because it leaves my skin very soft and shiny. this product is very good to use if you are a make up artist.,1.0

"Had horrible cystic acne after using this, if you are dry and have sensitive skin I would not recommend this. I used this and got like 5 new bigger pimples and my facialist said there is probably too much AHA + BHA for people with sensitive skin .",0.0
"I received this absolute free from Influenster in a voxbox. There wasn’t much product in the sample size so I only got about 4 uses out of it, which I hate reviewing products I’ve only used a few times, but here it goes. The scent was subtle, reminded me of baby lotion. It definitely moisturized my skin and gave it a soft glow. I personally don’t have any fine lines or wrinkles(yet!) and didn’t use it a ton to see those results. The only thing I was disappointed with was the consistency. It is SO thick. The thickness seemed to help contain the hydration better, but a little doesn’t really go a long way like other moisturizers I use. Once it was rubbed in it dried/absorbed fast, so I had to pretty much do sections of my face at a time, and meaning as there wasn’t much to work with I ended up using more than I anticipated with each use. I did see some benefits, but it is not worth 100$ in my opinion and I doubt I will ever purchase it. I do appreciate the opportunity to have tried it though! For women who are aging this may be a great product for you, I personally mainly saw benefits with the hydration",0.0
Would give it 5 stars but it has avobenzone in it which I’m not too happy about using :(,0.0
"I pretty much love this product. I was skeptical at first! I have such lousy problematic skin that it’s hard to find anything that I can use more than once! I’ve used this twice and both times my face doesn’t feel damaged it doesn’t seem like It Burns and doesn’t feel heavy or oily. I love anything Hawaiian so the scent is so perfect, my skin feels light and amazing and for the first time I felt comfortable without pounds of foundation on! Highly recommend this product",1.0
"This stuff smells great and the packaging had me hook,like and sink her. Unfortunately that is all it is for me because it did not do anything that it claimed. Drinks lots of water and keep yourself hydrated and save your  money and buy yourself a Carmex lip balm. For the price I paid I will keep the container and put carmex in it to the top.",0.0
"I was a little worried when I first put it on because it looked light from the sunscreen, but it later blended with my skin and helped with my red areas. It does feel a tiny bit sticky which isn’t my favorite but don’t think I would repurchase.",0.0
Great product. I’m so thankful that I was gifted by dermalogica sampling. It’s one of those products I’ve wanted to try for a while and finally glad I was able to get my hands on it. It is very exfoliating but left my skin soft and smooth. My texture has minimized since I started using this.,1.0
"I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks. It cleans fine, but as others have mentioned it does not feel like it could be exfoliating much because there are so few exfoliating beads. In the last couple of weeks my skin has become dryer than it has ever been, my hands as well, and the only thing I have changed is using this cleanser. So I’m not a fan - doesn’t feel great and dries out my skin (which is usually combination/oily). Also, as others have mentioned, the packaging is awful - pretty, but a thick plastic which is bad for the environment and tough to squeeze and get the right amount of product out of.",0.0
I find myself torn on this. It’s cost effective and with the right combo of products can really standout. I dislike the consistency and when I got HA elsewhere in my skincare regime then it didn’t have an additive effect.,1.0
"I really wanted to like this product but it just didn’t get along with my skin. My breakouts would get worse the day after using it and I didn’t see any benefits. I ended up giving it to a friend and she seems to like it, so definitely worth trying first to see how your skin will react.",0.0
Two stars for the packaging. Saw no improvement. Would not recommend.,0.0
"A great product, mix into any makeup item for a dewy glow. I mix one pump of this, one drop of another face oil, and one drop of a liquid highlighter into my tinted moisturizer and it’s a perfect glass skin look. I would not recommend this as your only niacinamide product if that is why you are eyeballing this as I cannot find what percentage it is and I prefer to have Atleast 5% niacinamide. I would consider this a makeup item with great ingredients rather than dedicated skincare.",1.0
I got to try this Olay brand of Hyaluronic + Peptide 24 Gel Eye Cream and enjoyed my results. My eyes felt hydrated and it lasted all day.  I didn’t experience any greasy after effects. I also noticed my eyes looked less puffy over time from continual usage.,1.0
"Exactly what I needed! Due to stress and always wearing a mask, my skin has been on a roller coaster these last six months in NYC. I’ve been dealing with hormonal cystic acne, uneven texture, and itty bitty pimples that seem to just be clustering around certain zones of my face. Within three days I saw a huge difference switching to this face wash. I feel like my “old“ skin is coming back to me. My pores are smaller, my oil is finally under control, and my breakouts are fading. This was my first Tatcha product and now I want to get everything! I’m so happy my skin is responding to this! Pros: gentle but effective, feels really nice to lather on the skin. My only con is that I agree with some other reviews — for the expense, I’d expect a better way to dispense product other than just squeezing it on to my palms... hard to control the amount that comes out but not a deal breaker.",1.0
"In comparison to The Ordinary’s salicylic acid mask, unfortunately Innisfree’s volcanic clearing clay mask came up short for me. While I loved that the mask was quite calmer than TO’s, it left a waxy residue on my face after rinsing off that would not go away. I don’t think this mask cleanses the pores beyond a superficial/surface-level type of ‘quick’ clearing. If you prefer your masks to leave you with a deeply refreshing/‘new face’ type of feel, this mask will leave you feeling very underwhelmed.",0.0
"I have normal skin, with a small patch of dry, flaky skin underneath my brow bone. I assumed it was some kind of skin condition that I should probably see a dermatologist for, since no moisturizer would ever fully soothe it. I bought this not even looking for a solution, just as a new moisturizer. This product is literally the bomb. The texture is somewhere between a cream and a whip, it sinks into the skin so quickly and I don’t have to rub and tug on my face. It’s so soft and non-intrusive, there’s no annoying fragrance and I know it will last me all night despite the light weight texture. As a bonus, the dry patch around my eye is gone, and only pops up if I skip on an application. Will never have to try a new moisturizer again!",1.0
By far the best lip balm!!! I would die without it!! It’s so worth the price!!!!!!,1.0
"I don’t know what else to say about this product except that I don’t feel like I can really “review“ it since it didn’t do anything noticeable for me.

"In general I love Ole Henriksen skincare as it always seems to be high quality and do wonderful things for my skin so I was excited when I received this from Influenster to try out. First of all, this smells like creamsicle heaven! (Probably should be kept away from children or pets because they might try to taste test it, it smells that good) It has a smooth, velvety, gel texture that glides on easily and absorbs fast. My skin was left feeling soft and hydrated. It did a decent job brightening some healed acne spots I had and in general, made my face just seem more alive and glowy. After using this for about 5 weeks, I went away on a trip and left this at home (in favor of something smaller size to fly with) and almost instantly I saw a change in the hydration of my skin. Definitely recommend.",1.0
"A basic cleanser that doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry, but also doesn’t make it feelHydrated either. The gel is pretty thick but I haven’t noticed any difference in blackheads.

This is a decent hyaluronic acid serum but they have wayyyyy better ones out their this one just does hydrate as much as other ones do like the naturium one,1.0
"My skin feels far from clean with thus facewash. It also feels like there’s a thin slimy layer left after it’s rinsed off. The smell of this wash is not appealing in any way, it really doesn’t smell good at all. I thought it would be a lot better than what it is with all of these reviews.",0.0
The product makes my skin glowy and slightly softer from applying it every two hours. The only cons is that it is very liquidy and doesn’t smell good.,1.0
I live where it’s ridiculously hot and humid and this is so cooling and hydrating. It’s a little luxurious step in my skincare routine.,1.0
"I love this cleanser but i haven’t used it long enough to know if it helps with acne, a lot of people say this product makes it worse before it gets better and has a detox effect on the skin so i’m going to continue using. it has a very fresh greens smell and makes my skin feel very nice and clean after using, also doesn’t dry my skin out.",1.0
"Got this as a sample to try.  I’ve been trying to decide how to describe it but there’s really no simple way to do so.  It’s thick but not heavy.  It doesn’t spread around as easily as done of the other face creams I have and my skin soaks it up like a sponge.  It’s not greasy, it feels great, and my skin looks great!  But I seem to use almost twice as much as my normal creams.  The sample only allowed a total of about 6 uses so I can’t say hisy this will work in the long term, but it seems like it’d do a good job.  I knocked a star off due to the fact that I seem to need more to cover my face and it’s not cheap.  $89 for a face cream isn’t too obnoxious no, but there are better more budget friendly creeks out there.",1.0
"I think this product is *fine* but it’s absolutely not worth the price point. When used daily, it dried out my skin, so this is a once a week product for me. A little goes a long way, so it should last forever which is nice. I received this product free for review.",0.0
Definitely one of the best toners out there. The scent is very fresh and probably why I love this so much.  I noticed a lot of improvement on my skin after my second time of using it. I got that nice glow and effictively made my skin smooth. I highly recommend this product. I got this product for free for testing purposes.,1.0
"It’s not a bad lip balm. It’s initially hydrating and has a GREAT scent. For my lips, I found myself applying it more than I wanted to for its price. I wouldn’t get this scent but I may give another scent like grapefruit or mint a second chance to redeem this product for me.",1.0
"At first when I apply this acid peel on my face, it was very strong. It feels really cool on the face and I could see the glow right away. When I woke up in the morning, the glow was still there and my skin was actually smoother. This product actually works! This was complimentary from goop beauty. Thank you very much!",1.0

"If you have very dry, flaky skin, this is the absolute best moisturizer out there. I recently had surgery, and as a side effect of the medication, my skin was completely dried out to the point of flaking. I tried everything with no luck, until The Dewy Skin Cream. Literally within 48 hours my skin was baby smooth! However - I normally have combination skin, so once my dryness was resolved, this moisturizer was just too dewy (It really does leave a dewy/shiny finish that will show through under foundation). Other than that, this was an absolutely amazing product. If you have Dry skin, you need to order this!",1.0
"I wanted to love this product. I loved the fragrance!! This should have caused concern for me but again I wanted to love it. After a month of use, my face continually got worse. Small blister like bumps on my t-zone. As soon as I stopped it, my face has cleared up. I went back to my fragrance free organic cleanser.",0.0
I love using this in the evening to take my makeup off.  Removes all of it with ease.  I do double cleanse by using a gentle cleanser after to remove the balm.  It works great with my sensitive acne prone skin.  I prefer this over the Clinique Take the Day Off balm.,1.0
"It’s not bad, provides a light layer of hydration and is nice underneath makeup. The Vitamin C and E are extremely low on the ingredient list though so not sure how much benefit you would be seeing if that’s what you were going for. I’ll finish the bottle, however, won’t be repurchasing.",0.0
"I bought this a few months ago and used it occasionally to get the nice glow, but I recently ran out of my usual moisturizer so I started using this one daily. It’s been about two weeks and throughout these last two weeks my skin has broke out and I have more redness and bumps all over my face. I do really like the gel like moisturizer and how glowing it makes my face but I am disappointed that it’s breaking out my skin.",0.0
"This lip sleeping mask is amazing! I have been using it since this summer, and I still have over half of the container left. It leaves my lips feeling soft and not chapped. Try this! You won’t regret it!",1.0
"I bought this product after a very insistent recommendation by a Sephora associate. It’s good, but definitely not for me (mainly, because I’m in my 20s, and this felt like it was formulated for more mature skin, or at least for different needs than mine).It was my first time using a dual serum, and though I was initially worried about the oil causing breakouts, it didn’t. My skin was noticeably smoother, and I liked the mild hydration, but for the price point, it just was not worth it. The feel is very silky, which I liked, but the strong perfume smell was very unpleasant. Compared to other serums I’ve used that also had an “anti-aging” claim, I felt this one was not nearly as hydrating or as plumping, though I do feel it gave a good, natural smoothness to skin, that was less shiny. Overall, definitely some strong pros, but the perfume is a major con for me, as is the price. It’s a product that I see can be good for some, but I regret being encouraged to strongly to buy for myself, and would not repurchase, or even encourage others to buy unless this is really what they’re looking for.",0.0
"Definitely not my favorite. It’s not the one for my skin, after using it it felt so dry and I hate how it smell.",0.0

"I’ve never had luck with oil before but this stuff is awesome! When you first put it on, it is a bit tacky/sticky or your skin but after about 20-30 seconds it is absolutely absorbed into your skin. I have sensitive skin and this didn’t bother me, or make me red. I use it under my daily creams for extra hydration. Esp in these Canadian winters. Highly recommend!",1.0
This is my favorite of the balm-to-lather cleansers because it removes almost  everything without feeling oily or filmy after. I wish it was slightly more effective on tougher mascaras without me having to use elbow grease but I do keep buying  it because nothing is really perfect but this comes darn close!,1.0
One of the best moisturizer I have used. Perfect for the winter dry skin. I have been using it for a week and can already see a difference. And I will be using it everyday. And I definitely recommend to get this.,1.0

"I had high hopes. I have an extremely oily face and this makes me break out more. It also smells AWFUL. I’m disappointed and its a pricey item. I thought it would be worth the money but definitely not. I’m still oily, and I have more acne than before I tried this product.",0.0
"Works well, but takes a little longer than most wipes I have used.   Definitely does NOT smell like watermelon.   To me the smell is unpleasant, but the product doesn’t dry out my face.   Though I like the feel, I won’t repurchase due to the odor.",0.0
"Nice product, moisturizes my skin during the cold winter days. The smell is also wonderful as well. But don’t spend 44 bucks buying this cream, origins makes a lot of value sets (especially during the holidays ) that includes this moisturizer. Save some money and buy those instead.",1.0
I love Tatcha and this cleanser is amazing. Makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth.,1.0
"I wanted to love this so badly but it made my skin break out in the worst way. It has a funky smell that I learned to get used to, but the way my skin reacted made me throw it out before it was finished.",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product because I get very pale in the winter and due to acne treatments I use. I will start off by saying I loved the colour I got from these. It did get patchy around my nose and forehead/eyebrow area but I think I could have combated that by applying less drops. For the price, the colour was very nice and noticeable. So onto why I’m leaving this review in the first place. Oh coconut oil, how I would love to love you, but how I don’t. Coconut oil is not my friend. Every time I use a product with coconut oil or just straight coconut oil on my face or body, I breakout. For some people, coconut oil doesn’t affect them and they swear by it, but for others, coconut oil can be pore clogging (it’s not non-comedogenic). Unfortunately, I’m that group of people who’s skin responds negatively to coconut oil. If these drops are to ever be made without coconut oil, I will FOR SURE repurchase these drops, but for now, I gotta say it’s a no from me and my skin. For those of you who really wanna try these out and see how your skin reacts, ask for a sample from Sephora! That’s what I did and I was able to determine if I liked them by using the samples.",0.0
Love how soft my lips feel.,1.0
this product is amazing. I wear it alot on my no make up days ( I only were making to work or events)  to just give me warmth to my skin I’ve used alot of product for the effect this give and this is by far the best it looks so natural and naturally tan other do give that slight make up look this looks like my skin its incredible,1.0
"If I can give negative stars I will. It is the worst face cream I ever put on my skin. It stings, irritate, and peel the skin on my face. The fragrance is so strong it’s obviously irritating and it’s okay to sell it and promote it, why? It created red blemish patches on my face and it never ever happened before. I don’t even have sensitive skin. Don’t buy it. Don’t even try the free samples. Throw it away or run away from it!!!",0.0
I’ve been using the Drunk Elephant TLC Night Serum for about a year and have seen more results out of this one the first week of using! I have oily acne prone skin and use this with my Youth to the People face wash and my skin is soo clear! Another plus to this one is the price compared to DE. I also use this every night :-),1.0
"The cream feels “dry” and does not make your skin supple, even right after use. It made my skin dull and grainy. I got the 100 point sample and so glad I was able to try before purchasing. I really don’t get the hype.",0.0
I received this moisturizer from Influenster for free for testing purposes. I have very sensitive skin and I have a hard time finding products that do not cause reactions. I also have very dry skin. This moisturizer doesn’t have a scent and I really appreciate that. It is a very thick moisturizer and since I have dry skin I definitely need thick moisturizers. I use this both at night before bed and in the morning. I do follow up with a facial oil at night for extra moisture. In the morning I just use this by itself. So far I haven’t noticed any skin reactions. I definitely wanted to give it a few weeks before reviewing. It definitely is pricey but I usually buy more expensive moisturizers so the price is less than those. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with dry sensitive skin.,1.0
Got this because it’s supposed to be good for sensitive skin & redness. used for over 1 month and saw minimal results regarding reducing redness. Give it 3 stars because it’s not a bad moisturizer.,0.0
"I used the product for almost a week, then threw it away.  The scent is very off-putting, and I do not usually care about that since I do not like fragrance, but it smelled like really old, rancid crayons.  The balm did okay to remove makeup, but it was unreasonably hard to wash off and left a film on my face.  I double cleanse regardless, but felt this almost needed a third cleanse since the second was just to wash off this product.  Appreciate the reasonable price point, but will not purchase or recommend mainly due to the filmy residue it leaves, and also the smell.",0.0
I’m not sure why this product is reacting to me but this didn’t do anything to calm my skin. I have dry sensitive skin and was looking for product that I could apply day and night without feeling dry or itchy. I love Dr. Jart products but I just didn’t get to have any of these benefits with this cream.,0.0
"First day of applying it to my face, it looked beautiful. I looked glowy and everything but for some reason, the next day and the day after when I used it, it started to make my skin look extremely textured. After the third day, I stopped using it because I also realized my skin had become VERY dry. Not sure if it’s due to the hyluaronic acid in it or if it’s just me or what, but will be returning for sure.",0.0

"This is my first time using a preCleanse and I am so impressed, after applying the preCleanse literally all of my makeup came off, even the mascara and eyeliner.  It was so gentle and my face felt incredible afterword.  I loved seeing the cleansing oil go to work on my makeup as I massaged it into my skin and a little goes a long way.  There’s no need to rub and scrub, just gently massage and you will have incredible results.  I received this PreCleanse Cleansing Oil complimentary from Dermalogica.",1.0

"I like that it didn’t feel heavy on my face. It felt like I was wearing nothing. No white cast, no weird smells. I have dark latte skin so I’ve never burned. I wouldn’t know how well it works as a sunscreen in that way. It also goes under makeup well. It does not feel layered and caked when you stack your normal makeup routine over it.What I don’t like about it is it’s not a flattering glow for me. I look sweaty or oily when I’ve done nothing. It really seems to point out my pores. I’ve always been told by facial specialists I have very tiny pores. But this product makes them look huge and I feel self conscious. I will not be repurchasing this specific product from SuperGoop.",0.0
always a staple repurchase. honestly havent touched other cleansing balms after trying this one,1.0
This is the best eye cream sleeping mask! I don’t get a lot of sleep and when I don’t use this stuff my bags and dark circles are hard to conceal. When I use this mask it makes such a difference! Easier to conceal and sometimes the bags aren’t even noticeable. Great product!,1.0

This serum actually works it helps to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles which I’m all for. I have used several other high end Serums and this one is definitely in my top three. This serum makes my skin feel silky smooth while applying and after, I just love it! I can’t say thank you enough for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing serum by Bare Minerals.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great serum to use. I absolutely adore this serum and I will be purchasing this one more often!",1.0

"Wow, was not expecting that when I got this cleanser. The hype behind this product is real, and so many people swore by it, but when I actually got a travel size sample to try, I didn’t find it to be anything special.CONSISTENCY/EASE OF USE (5/5) - Not much to say, it’s a standard jelly cleaner. Easy to dispense and use. A little watery, and can be worked up to slight lather.REMOVING MAKEUP (3/5) -  I used the cleanser the first time when I had light makeup on: CC cream, eyeshadow, and waterproof mascara. I rinsed with warm water, applied a generous amount of the jelly cleanser (a nickel’s worth), gave my face a good rub, and then rinsed. I still found some makeup left over on my towel when I wiped my face. Not a lot, but definitely some. Considering how drying this product is, I expected more.DRYNESS (2/5) - I have oily skin. Like, OILY. So as a result, I try to be picky with cleaners and only use that which can remove enough of my oil to prevent or reduce clogged pores, but not leave my face with a tight feeling because the tight feeling means rebound oil production. Well...that’s kind of what I got. My face felt pretty tight, much moreso than I would have liked after using this product. And I wouldn’t have minded if it got all the makeup off or cleared my pores, but it didn’t. I’ve used Aveeno’s Clear Complexion foaming cleanser before, and even as a foaming cleanser with BHA in it, I found it to leave less of a tight feeling in my skin, but do more in terms of taking off makeup and clearing pores.OVERALL (2.5/5) - Yeah, I was a bit disappointed with this product. I found it to be nothing particularly special or “luxury“ that you can’t get with a lot of other cleansers, or other jelly cleansers. For the price point, I expected more...a more thorough clean with a less astringent after-effect. Not that these are my go-to cleansers, but for a jelly cleaner, Belief’s Aqua Bomb Jelly cleanser is much better and cheaper, as is Glossier’s.",0.0

Hydrating. But heavily oily. About what you’d expect reading “6 rare african oils“ on the front. Was nice for a while. Switched to the Jet Lag Mask as an every day moisturizer for a while then switched back and it breaks me out now. ): Just too much for my skin. Clogged pore city.Really hydrating if it agrees with your skin. So I’d get a sample first.,0.0
I bought this product along with the peeling gel and it really messed up my skin. I don’t have bad skin to begin with but I am 22 and I wanted to start using ani-aging products early. Instead it burned my skin immensely. After one week week of using these products I noticed it giving me dark spots around my eyes and mouth. My eye lids and the sides of my mouth started feeling like sand paper. I returned immediately and i would not recommend it to anyone. It was so much acid in it. I get a lot of people like to “feel” that the product is working but all of these chemicals are very drying to the skin.,0.0
"After hearing so much about this product I decided to try it. And I hate this !!! It made me break so so much ! From the first use I notice new pimples the next morning.

"When I first received the Dior Dreamskin Skin Perfector I had no idea what it was supposed to do. The packaging was beautiful and texture was a silky lotion but was it a primer? Was it a serum? No clue, but after a little digging this seemed to be a mesh of both. This product claims to even out skin tone, blur imperfections, hydrate skin, and give a luminous finish. Sadly, for me this didn’t work. While this did hydrate my skin, it seemed to highlight my imperfections and definitely gave me more of a white cast than luminous glow. I do think this may work for those with lighter skin tones because it is a pinky white non-transparent color and on my darker skin it left a cast. On the other hand, yes, it hydrated a little, but nothing more or better than my current arsenal of serums and toners. Also, it did nothing to help my skin with dark spots, dullness, or large pores in the long run.My favorite product that actually delivers on their promise to even out skin tone and blur imperfections is the Murad Invisiblur Perfecting Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30 / PA+++. It is literally like a filter for your face, gives sun protection, AND it’s clear so no threat of a white cast. I had high hopes for the Dior Dreamskin Skin Perfector but ’ll stick with my Murad.I received this complementary from Influenster for review purposes.",0.0

I broke out in small red, dry, itchy welts after only 1 use. It was also too thick as being a serum. It felt more like a lotion and it didn’t melt into my skin. It felt like it just kinda laid on the surface and it was still there the next morning until I washed my face. I know for some people it’s probably amazing, but it did more damage to my face than it was worth to continue using. The itchy red bumps stuck around for well over a week.",0.0

It’s also drenched in amazing Coconut Water and it’s so cool/refreshing/soothing/happy on my face. I smile every time I use these! Of course there’s going to be some kind of product that will be difficult to lift with just this wipe, you may need to remove it with oil instead of water - then come back with these wipes, get the oil off and get all smiley and happy!!",1.0
"It’s probably great for people that have super oily skin! I have oily combination skin and outside of my T-zone it dried my skin out so bad that my face felt tight all day! I’ve tried it with a face oil and heavy moisturizer but no matter what I do it just dries my face out! So people with super oily skin would probably love this, and this is VERY mattifying!The other downside to this is that it definitely looks white and leaves that white sunscreen glare on your face! I’ve tried using less but that doesnt work because it just dries out really fast and doesn’t spread easily to the face! so it didn’t work for me but if you have extremely oily, pale skin and want a good mattifying sunscreen then this is your guy!",0.0

"Before I began using this product twice daily my under eye area looked bleak and tired. I’m 28 and the shadow of what will eventually become crows feet peeked through at the corners of my eyes.This product is creamy and lightly fragranced. The ingredients in it are clearly nourishing and I wish my regular facial moisturizer was as decadent as this product is. As I said before, I use this product twice daily: AM and PM. It’s the only product I use around my eye area, because I knew when it came time to give a review of the product I wanted to be honest and have my experience not affected by the serum and moisturizer I use on all other areas of my face.I have always been skeptical of eye cream. I figured it was a bogus product contrived by skincare companies to trick customers into purchasing more. However, I’d be lying if I said I haven’t been floured by how this product has brightened the area around my eyes. I feel like I look younger, and have even been complimented by the fact that I look 10 years older than I really am.

"Have been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now and I must say, I am impressed! I absolutely love it’s smell and it’s buttery consistency. It just glides on!

The product is great and works well but the amout of product is very very small for the price of it. If you would use this product daily or close to daily you would probably have to buy a new one every few weeks.  In my opinion they need to lower the price or add more product.,0.0
So far I am liking this product. I like the consistency and it washes off easily. The smell is pleasant also.  So far it has left my skin soft but I have yet to see the long term benefits. I wouldn’t say I would replace my late Somerville exfoliator for this one though. That’s my go to.,1.0
"Upon application it had really nice texture, my skin felt instantly softer and slightly blurred without it feeling overly matte. I have quite smooth skin and pores on the smaller side (due to having drier skin and targeted skincare routine). This primer made my foundation look cakey, settle, and separate, all things that don’t normally happen to me. I started to notice the dryness and itchy within about 3 hours on having it on. By the time I washed my face in the evening I was covering in slightly itchy, red hives, that almost looked my acne. The next morning I still had a little texture but nothing as bad as it had been the night before. I tired it a second time the following day just make sure it wasn’t being caused by new face oil I had also used for first time the previous day. The reaction I had the second was even worse, I had to take a Benadryl just to calm my skin. I’m not even mad it didn’t work for me, I’m glad I didn’t gain a new favourite primer that costs $68 CND.",0.0

In the evening, I pat the serum on my face after cleansing and then follow up with the new Clarins extra-firming energy cream, and my skin looks super refreshed in the morning.

I received this complimentary for my honest opinion.,1.0
"I love glow recipe, all of their other products are amazing and I really wanted to love this product as well. I love the idea of a cross over between chemical and mineral sunscreen. I read the reviews before I purchased it and it did mention pilling but it was a risk I was willing to take in order to try it out. At first there was no pilling at all but after continuous use pilling would occur and it’s just so disappointing. If the pilling wasn’t happening I’d give this product 5 stars but it’s just a huge issue that happens every single time I use this product.",0.0
"This is sooooo good. It is liquidy  and gives a shine so if you’re looking for something matte this won’t be it. But I find it so long lasting and it makes my lips feel buttery. This does have petrolatum so it will most likely sit more on top of your lips as opposed to soaking in but I just love it. And for the price, you can’t go wrong.",1.0

"The first time I bought this lip balm was about a year or so ago. I thought I finally found my perfect lip balm and would keep buying it from then on. The original one felt very smooth and lightweight, it just melted on my lips, and the moisture effect lasted long. This time around, as my balm was running out I ordered another one and it was a completely different experience! While the scent remained the same, the formula must have changed greatly. It now feels heavy on my lips, as if I coated them with a candle wax. More than that after about 10 mins since application it starts feeling dry and needs reapplying. This was nothing close to the original formula experience! It now feels like a cheap $3 chapstick I could buy at my grocery store. I compared the leftover in my old balm to this new balm and confirmed that it felt completely different. Then I came here and read other reviews of people saying the formula has changed. Very disappointed. Will look for another lip balm now.",0.0

But this eye cream is the first eye cream I actually love that doesn’t cost over $200. It makes my under eyes look so bright and awake. I think it might be helping with the appearance of wrinkles too. Shiseido has never really failed me, come to think of it. $70 for an eye cream may seem like a lot, but for your youth, that’s priceless. Also- most eye creams tend to make my eyes sting or itch. This one DOESNT!",1.0

"This was a huge miss for me. I bought this because I have oily skin and I heard this was good for that skin type. It made my skin oilier than normal, but I continued to use it. After a couple weeks, I noticed my skin was still oily but was also flaking on my nose and forehead. It also gave me texture galore. It’s definitely not moisturizing enough, and I have oily skin so anyone with remotely dry skin should steer clear of this.",0.0

"After reading through so many positive reviews, I was really excited to try the DE line. I use lip balm more than any other product and am still on the lookout for something clean and relatively affordable that actually works. So, the Lippe Balm seemed like the perfect choice for my first DE purchase. Sadly, it was probably the worst choice I could have made and may turn out to be my last DE purchase. First off, based on price/ounce, this is a VERY expensive product. It’s comparable to the most expensive I’ve tried, the La Mer balm, which is $65 but nearly 3 x the size (.32 vs .13 oz). So, I’d expect it to be more than a clump of coconut oil and wax on a stick which is essentially what it is. IMO, it’s on par with the balms you can pick up at your local natural grocery store for around $3. I was only able to test it briefly however, as I realized after looking at the actual product packaging, that it contains tree nut oil. This is likely a plus for most people. For someone like me however, who has a fairly serious tree nut allergy, it’s the last thing I want anywhere near my eyes or mouth. Perhaps it’s common knowledge, but I had no idea that “mongongo“ is actually a tree nut. I just assumed (incorrectly) that the balm didn’t contain nuts given the absence of any warning or explicit mention of the term “nuts“ or “tree nuts“ in the online product description or ingredient list. It wasn’t until I had the product in hand, saw the phrase “mongongo *nut* oil“ written on the packaging and did a bit of research that I realized I had just purchased something that isn’t safe for me to use. Although warning labels on beauty products containing common and, at times, lethal allergens is apparently not required by law, it would be really helpful if retailers and manufacturers, like Sephora",0.0

"This cleansing balm is not good in my opinion. It does almost nothing to remove my makeup (tinted moisturizer). I’ve even tried using it after using some micellar water to remove some of the makeup, but it STILL didn’t work. There is some kind of residue on the face (almost like petroleum jelly) after using it, but your second cleanse should remove it. The product instructions mention using serums and moisturizer directly after this, but I would definitely not use this without a second cleanse. I also find it pretty hard to squeeze out of the packaging (it almost feels like it should be in a jar instead). I did not try the product on eye makeup, so I can’t comment on that aspect. I would not recommend this product. There are plenty more options still on the affordable side  for a cleansing balm which will work WAY better than this.",0.0

After rinsing it makes your skin super soft and not oily. Highly recommend this product!",1.0
"When I tried this daily peel my skin was dry and dull and longing for affection from me. It was easy to put on and not as messy as I thought it might be. I instantly felt like my skin was being rejuvenated. My skin feels so soft and looks dewy without makeup. I love it. The only reason I’m giving this 4 stars is because while my skin felt soft it didn’t keep my skin as moisturized as long as I would have liked. Of course, that might just be my skin drying out too fast on its own.",1.0

"This thick cream is super nourishing, however it’s not oil free and can be quite occlusive( great for dry skin types!), unfortunately both those things flared up my rosacea and caused a bit of a break out. Also, cosmetically this is quite heavy and felt like it sat on the skin. That said, it did make my skin quite soft. I can’t speak to any of the other claims as that frequently needs more time and my poor skin just can’t hack it.

Do you really think globs of skin come off your face within the first 10 seconds?! No. other than that false claim, I do like this scrub. It’s a little better than the exfolikate that I usually use!",1.0

The packaging is absolutely beautiful and feels luxurious. The consistency is nice and thin and the oil melts right into your face without feeling sticky or oily. Love the ingredients used within this product. However there is a strong scent which I personally don’t mind, but could be bothersome to those more sensitive to scents. It’s comparable to Dior’s “J’adore” perfume. Unfortunately I’m sad to say that I personally did not see a difference in my skin after immediate use nor after a few weeks.

i’m not one to use facial scrubs but this product changed my perspective. I don’t like the way facial scrubs feel on my skin. The texture plus the after use is a no for me. But this specific scrub almost doesn’t have that scrub like feeling. It’s soft and it glides onto my skin very smoothly. I love the smell and texture. I would give this product 8/10 only because I don’t use scrubs like that. Nevertheless i’ll definitely use this scrub again. To add on I usually use it at night and it does a great job removing makeup and other things I have on my face throughout the day.,1.0

This product has little to no scent, which is great in my book. My skin felt great after  using it, though in the future I’ll use it in the shower, rather than in my sink, because it was hard to remove it all without water going everywhere :D.

"I got the Dermalogica Precleanse Cleansing Oil for free to review the product. I tried it twice - once without makeup and once with (including full eye makeup). One of the times was while wearing contacts and once without. I tightly close my eyes when washing my face and followed up with my usual face wash both times. In both experiences I found my face was left with red blotches that took about a half hour to go away. I was very gentle using the product and followed the instructions exactly. I do have very sensitive skin, but it holds up to face scrubs so I believe the redness was due to the product itself. It did remove my eye makeup well, but so do products one tenth the price. It was as if I was looking through oil for a few minutes after also - both with and without contacts in. The oil is VERY thin and runny. Putting it in a pump bottle makes it very messy and I had to make sure I used it quickly so it wouldn’t run down my hands and arms. I’d advise switching to another type of bottle - perhaps pourable. Overall, I do not recommend it.",0.0

So disappointed! The texture is just wrong and not enjoyable. I love this brand of oils but this cleanser was thick and felt like I was trying to spread honey on my face.

I only use this in the morning to reduce my dark circles, but I always have to follow up with another eye cream to moisturize. I use this in conjunction with another product by Deciem (the parent company of the Ordinary), Hulamide SubQ Eyes Advanced Serum. They work great together!

These stick great to your skin. I toss and turn and these didn’t budge. They are also super easy to apply. That’s basically where the positives stop for me.

I use a cleanser, toner and serum normally, but adding this cream to the mix upset the balance of my skin.1 star for glass packaging, 1 star for soft skin",0.0
This really didn’t do much for my skin. It leaves a sticky film on my skin so I only use it at night and even then it’s still annoying because it gets on my arm as I sleep and it’s just sticky.

"I recieved this sample sized for free in exchanged of my honest review. Same as the toner this one has no scent the only difference I noticed between this one and the toner is that this one lives a tacky gripping feeling on the face “very convenient for before makeup“ the tackiness will eventually go away after very few minutes when the product has completely sink in to the skin and fully dries down. I didn’t noticed any difference (bad nor better results) in my skin with continuous use. So unfortunately the claims of reducing the appearance of dark spots, even out the look of skin tone and making the skin look less oily I didn’t experienced from this samples “once I used all the products I was sent, my face actually looked kind of glowy/dewy and eventually oily“. This one I would use it as a prep-primer which is why I give this product 2 stars.

I was so excited to try this product because Ole Henriksen makes such great stuff. Initially I was a fan of the packaging as it looks so clean and fresh. The mask is pink and sticky upon application. I’m not a fan of the pump style packaging because it gets really sticky and messy after using it a few times. The mask is meant to be good for anti-aging and brightening.  I noticed immediate results when I washed it off. However after an hour my skin felt really thick and oily and I even broke out after every use. This product did not work well with my skin and I will not be purchasing in the future.  I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.,0.0
I received Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery Oil free from Abeille Royale and Influenster for my honest review.Let me start with saying the packaging is absolutely stunning. It has a light perfumey scent that does settle down after being on your skin after about 30 minutes.I wanted to love this serum but it wasn’t right for my skin. I used it as directed making sure not to use to much but it made my skin sticky & the stickiness remained until it was washed off. My skin also appeared splotchy & my pores looked larger then normal. I couldn’t stand to even touch my face because it was so sticky feeling and felt smothered.  It was also impossible to wear makeup with this product. Having said that my skin was hydrated but there are other serums out there that do a better job for less money.Thank you Abeille Royale and Influenster for chosing me to review this product I wish I had a better out come.,0.0

"I honestly love this stuff. As somebody who has pretty dry and sensitive skin, this product has been very good for me. I’ve tried a lot of different things (lots of expensive products that have not done very much for my skin..) but this one I do actually notice a difference with. I first received a sample size of this and found my skin both felt softer, and looked brighter/refreshed. A year after using the sample it was still on my mind so I finally bought the 30ml size (which is quite a good amount for the price) and within a few days of using it two different people complimented me on my skin. I have some minor acne scarring that i’ve been trying to get rid of for a while, and this is where I’ve noticed the biggest change for me. It’s almost completely cleared up. I will say that I do not follow the instructions correctly- I usually cover my face in a thin layer of this mask before I put on my makeup and leave it on (as apposed to washing it off after the recommended 5-10 minutes). I don’t know if I’d suggest this to everyone, but my skin seems to really love this stuff. I also have slight dermatitis around my eye area, and this does not seem to irritate it at all.",1.0

I talked to a girl at sephora about something for my lips and she suggested this and said it was quite popular. But when I said it’s not hydrating enough and that I need more.. she told me she uses this lip balm and then puts on some of the Laneige lip mask on top. So I started doing that, too.

Like other reviewers said, this cream is luxurious and melts like butter into your skin.

The only issue is when I apply my tinted moisturizer which I probably shouldn’t anyway.,1.0
Doesn’t remove makeup … legit just feels like you’re rubbing lotion butter on your face that burns your eyes. I’d say if you don’t really wear makeup and are looking only for a cleaner sure moisture… I’d imagine it would be very hydrating with how it felt on my skin. I could feel the softness of the product on after I rinsed it off despite my makeup still staying in place…,0.0

"It’s my serum, bought by recommendation. I’m not sure what to base it on, but it goes on easy, absorbs well, doesn’t leave me greasy or oily. I use it as part of a routine 2x a day, morning and night. Cleaner, mist,serum, moisturizer. Def affordable",1.0

"Love love! I take ashwagandha every day to help with my anxiety, so I was super excited to try this product out. I have combination skin and this moisturizer works great for me. It isn’t too thick or creamy, and absorbs quickly into the skin while moisturizing. I’m always on the hunt for a lightweight moisturizer and this one fits the bill. I love that it’s clean and has quality ingredients.",1.0
"This moisturizer is amazing and gentle with my sensitive skin. fresh is one of my favorite brands and they did such a great job with this black tea moisturizer. I highly recommend to anyone who has sensitive, dry skin. My skin went from dull and flaky to hydrated and glowy within just a few days of using this product. I was Gifted by Fresh!",1.0
I absolutely adore this product. I received it complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.It’s super gentle on the skin but enough exfoliation to make your skin baby smooth. I have dry skin and this is not stripping at all or overly abrasive. It has my skin feeling extra smooth and pores extra tiny. I have this product to thank for glowing skin!,1.0
Feel it does cleanse but too early to tell if it’s truly different from other toners I’ve tried and it’s but pricey.,0.0
It has a nice sensation slight touch when you first apply it. It doesn’t seem to greasy which is great! It feels great and smooth when you take it off. I will use it Again!,1.0
"Uuuuum did I receive the same product that everyone is raving about in all these positive reviews?!? (Insert side eye) So again I had this in my cart to purchase and although there were a lot of positive reviews I was skeptical. I ended up choosing to get this as a sample with my order and I’m so glad I did because it definitely would have been returned!This is an average yet abrasive exfoliant that I would not justify paying $45+ bucks for. The sample I received I got three uses out of it and it did nothing that it claim to do other than dry my skin out and left my skin looking ashy and dull. It is a pretty rough exfoliant as far as you definitely feel like it’s buffing your skin and getting in there, but my skin didn’t show any improvement or look polished once I washed this off.It reminds me and have similar texture as the Youth To The People Yerba Mate Resurfacing Exfoliating Energy Facial with Enzymes Microdermabrasion Treatment. They both have those abrasive micro-exfoliant crystals that really exfoliate the skin, except with this one my skin didn’t show any improvement and I had to follow up with a hydrating mask.It didn’t have a scent, it didn’t break me out or cause any irritation, however it didn’t leave my skin smooth, glowing, or polished. For those reasons I wouldn’t purchase or recommend",0.0
"I received this product for free in exchange for a review.  This is a solid moisturizer.  Nice texture that really melts well into the skin.  Simple but appealing packaging.  Probably best for dry skin because it does leave an oily finish.  I’m giving it 3 stars because I think the name of the product is pandering to very of-the-moment trends that aren’t based in science, and I like science.  Also, for the price I think the packaging could be a little better.  It’s a good, solid moisturizer, but I don’t think the quality is right for the price. I will not be purchasing with my own money.",1.0

"I used the sample that was given to me and loved it right away! The smell is def not great but it doesn’t bother me because I could see that my skin was smoother with the few applications that I got from the sample. Once I used the sample, I bought the 1oz bottle at the store, but something was very different, the smell was pleasant (lemongrass, citrus scent), the application, texture felt very different, so I wonder if I was sold a “fake“, or one that was previously used, and filled back up with a different cream. I will be returning this product and buy another one from a different store, making sure this time that it is the REAL THING!",1.0
"I’ve purchased all of the Tatcha Kissu lip masks over the years and kept with that tradition when I picked up this newest Plum Blossom shade. The original Kissu lip mask has more of a jelly-like consistency. Tatcha has since released two tinted versions, both limited edition - Red Camilla which launched October, 2021 and most recently, Plum Blossom. This is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador based on my experience with this newest lip mask to the Tatcha Kissu collection.Plum Blossom is a pinky-plum shade that leaves a hint of color and sheen to my naturally pigmented lips. I can get more color if I add another layer. It has a balmy-gel consistency that allows it to glide smoothly onto the lips. There’s a slight tack to the product but it’s subtle. My lips feel moisturized even after the color disappears. The presentation on this lip mask, from the design of the jar to the packaging is signature Tatcha - aesthetically elegant with the gorgeous illustration on the top of the jar and it includes a mini spatula for picking up the product and spreading it over the lips. This lip mask doesn’t just look lovely on my lips, it’s beautiful sitting atop my vanity table. It makes a wonderful gift too!",1.0

I use it as a primer and a nightly moisturizer so it’s taken the place of several products, and I very quickly have noticed such a big difference in my skin and the way my makeup applies! It’s glowing and healthy and I’ve received so many compliments! I will never be without this and it’s worth every penny!!!!",1.0
I enjoy this toner very much. I stopped using lots of products because this alone is very hydrating. I love to use it with the niacinamide dew drops. They’re the perfect combo in my opinion.,1.0
"I’ve always struggled with blackheads, so I wanted to love this product so much! But it just was a waste of money, honestly. The product feels awesome and it sticks to the skin so well! I was super excited the first night I tried these. I wore a nose strip overnight and woke up like a kid on Christmas! I ripped it off in excitement and stared at it and immediately became disappointed. Not only did it not pull anything out (believe me, there are blackheads to pull out), but my skin looked exactly the same; the pores were still clogged and the same normal size. I thought maybe it wasn’t because I exfoliate at night and didn’t so before trying this product, so the next time I tried it (a few days later), I did not exfoliate before putting one on. The next morning, nothing. At this point, I figured I better use ‘em all up to get my moneys worth. I also realized that they also have a terrible, faint pee smell. I have 3 dogs and kept feeling like I was smelling pee somewhere but I couldn’t find it! I didn’t realize it until I used the strips for a 3rd time and it finally clicked. Overall, I will NOT be buying these again and definitely wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. If they can’t  work on my blackheads, they surely won’t work for anyone else’s.",0.0

Container that it came in was good quality. Rose scent was very apparent as soon as I screwed off the top. It was smooth and creamy felt nice going on my face.

"I have been suffering from acne outbreaks for a while, so I decided to splurge on this product because everyone gave it glowing reviews and I was desperate. I used 3 to 4 drops in the morning and at night after washing my face. After a couple of weeks I didn’t notice any improvement; The oil was heavy, so it made my skin look and feel super greasy. I’m already oily, so that made my face look straight up wet. Not one to quit, I continued using the ufo oil for at least 3 months, and my skin only got worse. I decided to overhaul my skincare and stopped using this, and literally the next day my skin looked 100x better. This might be good for people with dry skin who have acne, but it didn’t work for me at all. The smell is also not the best. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this, and I’m sad I wasted so much money.",0.0
"This is my first toner. It smells great, and application feels great. I can tell it gets stuff that my facewash misses because of how the cotton ball looks. I do think it has helped my pores.

"I’m in my late 30s with normal-to-dry, clear skin, no major issues. I don’t understand how this is possible, but like some other reviewers have stated, this made my skin MORE dry and within days, completely changed the texture of my skin for the worse, making me look aged. It was so drying that it even rendered my hg moisturizer (Embryolisse Lait Concentre) completely ineffective. I actually had to schedule a facial to fix what this did to my face. It was also super sticky, which I was not a fan of, and felt tight and not at all moisturizing/replenishing. I simply don’t get the hype and it will be going back.",0.0
"When the product is so good you need to tell the world. I suffer from eczema on my face and have tried SO many different creams of all price ranges; lama retro, fresh rose cream, water cream from LN some were good in not irritating but didn’t deliver enough moisture. I look for two things one that won’t aggravate my eczema especially around my eyes but also one that hydrates it enough to keep the dry/flakiness at bay. I learned the hard way that I always need to try a product before buying and I can instantly tell if it’s going to irritate me or not. At Sephora I tried a sample and put a dab on my eczema prone skin to see if it would irritate and it seemed ok so I bought the kit of face wash, serum and cream and crossed my fingers.. let me tell you my skin is hydrated and plump and glowing and eczema no where to be found in just a few days. I cannot recommend this enough!",1.0
Lovely smooth feel and light scent. Perfectly creates a natural-looking glow while moisturizing.,1.0
"Oh man. So I got the sample with my points. I wanted to know what all the hype was about. First off.. the smell. Oml. I can’t take it it’s so strong and doesn’t smell pleasant at all. Unfortunately I didn’t want to waste it, I tried it. Where did it go? You’re right it’s a water cream.. it sank right in like water.. and then did nothing. No hydration. No nothing. The packaging is adorable but this did nothing for me. I have drugstore products that could outdo this just by staring at the jar. Major bummer but on the plus side at least I didn’t waste the money on a full size.",0.0
"Wow I’ve been using this for 2 weeks now and have NOTICEABLY softer, clearer, brighter, “GLOWIER“ skin. I actually 6 outta 5 recommended this product, and already have to friends and family who can verify my skin is a lot nicer these days. I use in combination with their other products and my skin is something I’m starting to feel good in without makeup! Worth it for the benifits and the amount of product you get.",1.0
"Upon receiving a notification from Influenster that I would be gifted this skincare product for testing purposes, I was eager to test the item due to its claims. This item claims to be a powerful exfoliator with specific ingredients that help achieve a healthy, radiant glow all while— reducing their appearance of dark spots and smoothing skin texture. This product is marketed as a “peeling gel-like mask”; it is supposed to assist with getting rid of dead skin cells by applying the product to skin and rubbing product in circular motions creating “fallout” of “dead skin cells” when it is mostly just the product gunk being balled up. After several uses of this mask, I’ve found that the fallout is more so the effect of the product itself and not the existing dead skin cells. I have not seen much of a difference in terms of brightening existing dark spots and uneven skin textures. I am grateful for the opportunity to try this product but would not purchase this with my own money since this particular product did not meet its own claims.",0.0

It absorbed into my skin without a greasy film, my skin felt refreshed, it gave a nice healthy glow and it didn’t just sit on my skin. I used it in place of my normal primer and my foundation was like butta! Definitely a skincare staple for the dry faceded masses",1.0
"I really like this product. The “flavor” is mild and doesn’t have a chemical-laden taste to it like other lip balms. It also has a really smooth application. I like that the applicator is wider than the average lip balm tube. I do find myself frequently reapplying, but I also do this with many other lip products. I will definitely purchase in the future, despite the steep cost.",1.0
"Decided to give this a try on a whim because I love my Clinique take the day off cleansing balm and I disliked the fact that it took me not only 5 rinses, but I had to use a washcloth to take this cleanser off my face. Feels greasy on the skin so I’ll be sticking to my Clinique.",0.0
"I received this small jar in a sample assortment. This is truly one of the worst products I have ever had the displeasure of having on my skin. When I first received this, I tried it on my hand/forearm area first, thank goodness. It is SO thick, opaque and sticky, I can’t imaging ever putting this on my face. While it does correct redness/give a slight tint, it made me look even more pale, and  I practically spontaneously combust in the sun. The final test was today when I saw the jar sitting there and figured I would just try to use it and see how it works. I applied it on my arms, hands, and back of my neck before I went to do some yard work.  I get inside and think I really worked hard, because I smell so awful. Nope, it is this stuff on my arms, It smells horrible and it is all I can smell.I  can’t shower fast enough. Consider yourself warned.",0.0

"I would suggest this as a step 1 in a double cleanse routine at night. Too balmy and stays on your skin to just be a cleanser alone. I enjoy this on days that I wear makeup or several layers of sunscreen on. I have oily skin and easily clogged pores and this doesn’t cause issues however, like I said I do not use it everyday maybe twice a week on those days I need to double cleanse. If you wear mineral suncreen, you will need something like this to take it off and do the double cleanse.. FYI.",1.0

I received this product as a free sample from biossance and Influenster  in exchange for my unbiased review. I tried this moisturizer and while it’s nice that it’s unscented from a fragrance standpoint the smell is off-putting to me. The cream texture of the moisturizer felt nice going on but I didn’t notice any lasting improvement to the moisture in my skin. Lastly it separated foundations and makeup that I never have issues with under thicker moisturizers,0.0
I use every day on top of moisturizer & put foundation over the unseen sunscreen. My skin is sensitive- no break outs ever. I’ve gone through several tubes. I never have pilling at all when I use this product. To me it feels light & not heavy at all. Amazing- absolutely love it.,1.0

This moisturizer just doesn’t work for me. I found that it made my face feel dry and get a bit flaky which was something I had under control until I tried out this product. My face just feels very tight and not in a good way. If you have drier skin I would recommend looking elsewhere. Just isn’t worth it to constantly feel like you have to reapply moisturizer and feel really dry only 15 minutes after applying. It also doesn’t spread very well and I had to use a lot in order to get my whole face.,0.0

In the week or so that I used it I don’t feel my skin was firmer or noticed any less wrinkles. If the sample I received had been a month’s supply, there may have been more noticeable results. It did not make my face feel greasy at all. This is huge for me to find a moisturizer that doesn’t make my face feel oily. I did not mind the scent. It was subtle and I did not find that the perfume was overwhelming. I would probably not recommend this for anti aging unless I used more but I would recommend it as a moisturizer.",1.0

"I love the fact this is a clean product—I wrote a long review of clean products and this product in my insta @beautybeyondage. I’ve used it for 2 months now and it has really brightened my skin. You don’t need much—but for the summer I don’t add a moisturizer after this so I use 5-6 drops for my face and neck. I love that it’s fragrance free. It sinks in relatively quickly too, which I like. It’s a light oil, as I’m not fond of anything real heavy on my face in summer. I’ll add a moisturizer this fall as it gets colder. The fact that is a truly clean product and the company practices sustainability and transparency is important to me. Yes, it’s pricey, which is why I’ll probably use less now on my second bottle. I find it’s worth it though, not just for the fact that it actually works, but is a clean beauty product. I’ve done a lot of research and I started at the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database—it ranks the cleanliness of products and tells you the dirty chemicals to watch out for. I do use some “not as clean” products, but it’s really all about balance. As for this clean product, it really works and I completely recommend.",1.0
"I really wanted to love this product because it really does work in cancelling out redness and has SPF. I will say it really only caters to lighter skin tones when its blended out which is a flaw. However, this product broke me out really horribly. I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin but when it really doesn’t like a product, it will break out like crazy. I ended up having to toss this because my skin hated it that much. Super unfortunate but a good thing to keep in mind before purchasing if you tend to break out over new products!",0.0
"I’ve struggled with acne for a decade now (a decade!!!), so I’ve tried literally everything short of accutane--prescription and otherwise. I heard good things and giving this product a go was literally life changing! First day: noticeable difference. 2nd day: Dramatic difference. One week of use: clear skin!!! I did get a few purging pimples but nothing major. This product is so so worth it and if you’re someone who feels like they’ve run out of options I urge you to try this!",1.0
"I decided to buy this, because I wanted an everyday physical sunscreen. I really wanted to like this, but this product does not play well with other skin care products that you put on your face. I find that it easily pills. For a pea-sized amount, it still made my combination skin feel like an oil slick. Feeling discouraged, I also tried using it alone - right after cleansing. It sat on my skin and felt so heavy, not to mention that it made my skin itchy. I had to wash it off, because I was getting a bad reaction. Upon checking my face, there were red irritated, itchy patches on my cheeks and chin area.  Zinc oxide at this amount is definitely not for me and I’m giving this DE product a hard pass.",0.0
"About 6 months ago I started suffering from some of the worst hormonal acne I’ve ever experienced. Because of this, I’ve been doing research on skincare ingredients. Quality skincare products and having a routine is very important to me. This is by far the best product I’ve ever used, and I will not go without it going forward. I find that the best thing I can do for my skin to get a nice glow is exfoliate, whether it be physical or chemical. I use these pads every morning after cleansing. It’s very important to wait at least 10 minutes for the product to penetrate your skin before adding any additional products to your face. I follow with a moisturizer and my skin is glowing! Something I’ve noticed is that these work better for me in the morning. My skin looks much more refreshed compared to when I use them at night. The only downside is the peach scent. It’s unnecessary and could possibly irritate people, although it doesn’t irritate my skin. Give these a try!!!!",1.0
"The smell and texture were fine. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, but it wasn’t as moisturizing on my dry winter skin as I wanted it to be.",0.0
Covers up the redness nicely but I felt like it just gave me a sick complexion. No scent to this product and it didn’t break out my sensitive skin so that was a plus. Just don’t think it works well with my skin tone.,0.0
Definitely made my skin softer but I didn’t notice much else. Will continue to use as recommended to see if there are long term benefits and makes any further changes to my skin.,0.0

"I wanted to love this but first application the scent was really overpowering. I got used to it and use it now and then. I wouldn’t call it a mask, more like an average moisturizer. Did nothing for my dry areas. I now just use it as a layer with other products.",0.0
"The texture is great! I did not see the blurring effect as much as I would have liked, but it was subtle. I also use powder foundation so that also may have had something to do with it. I would definitely try this with liquid foundation. There is no scent which is also nice, but I don’t mind a little sometimes. It went on smoothly and made my skin feel hydrated and soft.",1.0
Just okay. Not worth the money. Weird but subtle smell.,0.0

I love a good hyaluronic acid serum! This so great for people with dry skin! I got this complimentary through Influenster and loved how hydrating it was but it wasn’t for my skin.,1.0
"I genuinely was rooting for this one! First, The good: The shelf life is a lot higher than most other Vit C serums and products. Vitamin C is not super shelf stable, so it can make using this product over time pretty unsustainable, but the redesign made it so that you mix it yourself, cutting out the time between production and your first use, thus you can use it longer! Which is a huge plus. I store mine in the fridge to prolong its effectiveness. It is also effective, I use it with the Protini Moisturizer and they play really well with one another. This serum is great for brightening and my skin is visibly smoother in the morning when I use it before bed. I think it could be an amazing option if someone is looking for effectiveness and strength in a serum. Now, the bad:The SMELL. The scent of this is nauseating. I’m not sensitive to scents, but this one is awful. I have gotten myself mostly used to it by now from regular use, but sometimes its so intense I will have to wash it off before the morning. I can’t quite describe it because it isn’t a fragrance, its that metallic, almost bloodlike smell some vit cs have, but pumped to the max. I will use it because I love the effects it has on my skin, but it’s sometimes hard to stomach. The texture is also pretty unpleasant, its very sticky and sits on top of the skin for a long while before it finally sinks into the skin, sometimes I will still feel it in the morning. I usually will use excess serums on my hands for some added moisture or to prevent aging, but with this one I need to wash it off immediately, because I feel like I could stick to the wall like Spiderman if I put my hand on it. Overall, It is a great serum, but for the price, I wish it was more pleasant to use.",0.0
Wanted to love this but it broke me out :(,0.0

"This is the ONLY product that I have ever used and returned to the store...it was that bad. It is like trying to spread syrup on your face, and God help you if you get any in your mouth because it tastes absolutely vile. I don’t mean if you eat a ton; I mean if you get the tiniest little bit anywhere near your mouth it gives you this overpowering bitter taste. Plus, it made me break out within three days. I stuck with it for a weak, but this was a major letdown.",0.0
"#giftedbyFresh - Oh how I’ve been loving this cream. The combination of black tea and ceramides is genius!! It has the best texture that instantly melts into my skin, providing hydration and nourishment - exactly what my skin desperately needs right now. Love it so much.",1.0
"Really the review is a 3.5Negatives- it stains EVERYTHING. And it doesn’t come off at least I couldn’t get it off most things.. mostly 2 white shirts, they were ruined.- my bottle broke, and I’m not careless with my stuff. In the end I didn’t mind cus I got through it faster. - this is weirdly specific but whenever I used my BHA toner it just didn’t go well at alllll. I waited a while too but still I couldn’t use them on the same days, it made me face weirdly oily and porous - when your face gets wet, it makes you look almost holographic, I wanted glow not iridescent greasy mess- my skin just didn’t seem to love it. I noticed my skin has gotten redder, when before it was more even. I suspect It’s because I can only use mineral is what I think Positives- I’m acne prone and it didn’t break me out! - I did enjoy the glowy look sometimes I probably wouldn’t buy this particular product again, but I’m not deterred from the entire brand!",0.0
"I have combo/sensitive skin. I bought this in hopes of it helping my mask acne and shrinking some large pores around my nose, but it did so much more than that. It completely got rid of the texture on my face, the wrinkles between my eyebrows, plus helped clear up my acne and shrink my pores. My skin looks amazing!",1.0
"I was sucked into buying this bc of the Tatcha hype and the packaging lol. I was searching for a good facial mist for years and I thought this would be promising considering Tatcha has pretty good moisturizing products but I was wrong. I have combo skin and I was looking for something to give me a boost of hydration mid day as I’m super busy and obviously can’t apply moisturizer over my make up in the middle of the day. This product gave me hydration in all the wrong places. It made my t zone extremely oily and my cheeks even drier! I didn’t even finish the tiny sample size I paid $20 for because it did absolutely nothing. The spray it blotchy and uneven, the product smells weird (not bad just weird), and I didn’t even look dewy when using it. If you want a good dewy facial spray I recommend Innisfree’s cherry blossom spray, way more product for a much better price!",0.0
This a great everyday facial cream that is not too heavy. No fragrance which is great! I love this product for winter months because it really locks in the moisture without being thick to apply. It works well under sunscreen and makeup too! I would recommend it to combination skin types,1.0
"I had been only using a toner in my skincare routine so I was excited to try out the SK-II essence. I applied it right after the toner, before serum and moisturizer. I really like the product and it adds a nice prep to the skin prior to going in with the moisturizing products in my routine. I recommend!",1.0
Very happy with this lightweight cleanser. I was worried going from a cream cleanser to a jelly that my skin would feel dried out and it is definitely not the case. I use along with their serums and creams - loving how my skin is looking.,1.0
"I love this face cream as it makes my skin feel so hydrated. It doesn’t cause any breakouts which is excellent as soo many creams do! Also it absorbs nicely, no greasy feeling and it does fill up the small wrinkles. Overall, very good face cream.",1.0
"This moisturizer is very moisturizing, but I have combination skin that leans more toward oily. It makes my skin really oily. If I put a blotting paper on my face, it would be completely transparent. I wish it had SPF in it as well. I didn’t really see much of a difference in my skin with the supposed anti-aging benefits. If you have dry skin, this would be good for you. If you have combination or oily skin, I wouldn’t recommend this for you.",0.0
I wish I could do like 2.5... I’m not totally in love with this product. I went in to my local Sephora looking for a different product that I guess they don’t carry. The lady recommended me this. I wanted a chemical exfoliant and this one kinda doesn’t totally feel like it is. I swear it has tiny beads or something in it. I have dry to combo skin and this is just too harsh. I normally use the Bosica chemical peel gel. I wash and exfoliate every day to every other day plus the rest of my skin care.. this just isn’t it. I do appreciate that it is cruelty free.,0.0
Nothing special. Maybe I didn’t give it long enough to work but just didn’t see any results,0.0
Living in a dry climate this oil is a lifesaver when it comes to keeping my skin hydrated. I typically put this on at night so that it can hydrate my skin while I am sleeping. Pro-tip: I also add a little of this to the tips of my hair for extra moisture.,1.0
"I was gifted by @Sundayriley for reviewing purposes. Good Genes product is amazing. From the moment I received it in the mail I have been using it every other day. I can already see the fine lines and wrinkles fading. As soon as you put the product on you can see and feel it working. As recommended on the box I use the product as a mask, because I have very sensitive skin. This product has my skin feeling so smooth, my skin looks clearer, and a glow that’s out of this world. I will definitely be recommending this product to all my skincare loving friends. It is totally worth the cost!",1.0

"I don’t usually write reviews, but Y’ALL. This is a game-changer for me in my skincare regimen. I have always had mild acne with flare-ups constantly, and my skin is really prone to scarring easily, so there were some scars that I had essentially just accepted. I figured they’d never go away. I have been using this product for three weeks, though, and all of my scars have faded by at least half! Some of them have disappeared entirely! It’s a miracle! I’ve also been getting less active flare-ups, and now I basically only get a pimple or two around the start of my period. Do yourself a favor and buy this stuff. It is magic.",1.0
"I honestly love this product. It leaves my face feeling super soft & glows w/o feeling all greasy . My skin absorbs it very fast , nice smell .

Perfect for summer !",1.0
"I was gifted this product by Goop to try and I can honestly say that I love the way my skin is feeling and how it looks.  It doesn’t have a strong smell at all.  It has a subtle smell.  It isn’t as harsh as other Exfoliator’s, but is gritty enough to get the dead skin cells off.  My face feels smooth and my pores don’t seem to be as noticeable as they once was.     You only use it 2-3 times a week so I jar will last awhile.  It doesn’t even take that much to do it’s job.  I am loving the results so far.  I am thrilled that this GoopGlow exfoliator was gifted to me.",1.0
"I have only tried the sample of this, lasted for about a month and I fell in love. Need to purchase the full size. The smell is so amazing it made me love it right away.

Also I love that it is a clean product, makes it even more lovable.",1.0

"Love at first try.  Only need like 1/2 a pump or less.  3 weeks later, my skin is even softer than ever before.  I have very oily and dry skin.  The product doesn’t sit on my skin but rather absorbs right in.  I hardly have to use much cream after so it will save me a lot.  I do find a significant difference if you used the essence first because it requires less product and soaks in more.  My boyfriend tried on his hand and he was shocked when it absorbed in.  Told me to keep it.  I’ve tried many serums but never expected this result.  Fine lines and dry spots are gone.  No breakouts.  Beautiful product.  There is a scent but it diffuses within minutes.  I’m sensitive to smells too.  Along with the face wash, my skin is at its best.  Give it a try.  Ignore the scent and you’ll notice after that it’s barely there.  100% recommend.  Before pic, see fine lines on forehead and eyes.  I’m 43 years older.",1.0

I have used for about 2 weeks...my skin is breaking out like crazy. Just the small surface level ones, but normally I have perfectly clear skin. My skin texture is also very dry and the texture of my skin is no longer soft and supple. I have combination skin, but it still takes away too many oils from the skin.",0.0

"This serum wrecked my skin. It made me break out with huge cystic acne all over my face. Pimples are normally very rare for me and usual show up around my t-zone when the occur. A couple days of using GG and I had massive painful zits on my forehead, chin, cheeks, everywhere. I played around with this product for a month, slowly phasing it in, using it with anti-inflammatory oils, alternating with AHA. I wanted this to work for me so badly but eventually ended up returning it. When I took a closer look at the other reviews after and noticed others were having a similar experience and I blame the formula change. I had gotten a sample of this about 2 years back and like everyone else described; it had a thin consistency and a slight sting to it on application. The sample itself was too small in quantity to notice any real long lasting change but I did notice my skin was looking slightly plumper and had somewhat of a glow the morning after. So I tucked it away in the back of my mind to try a full sized bottle. When I finally got around to it the formula had changed and it was thick, sticky, no sting, smelled like cleaning product. I still noticed my skin looking slightly plumper but the acne was a deal-breaker. Unfortunately I think this experience turned me off of the brand entirely.",0.0
"Because of the price I was expecting something that would really hydrate my skin and help me with some dark spots as the product claims to help but nothing really happened. this only kept me away from “waay too dry“ skin but didn’t feel hydrated, specially not after putting it on after my lotion since I felt the product was only sitting on my sking and not doing anything. I could say even my family noticed it since couple times after applying it they kept asking me “why are you sweating?“ I kept using it for about three months and this is what I noticed: the product starts smelling bad, like really bad, and it gave me a huge break out problem which is the reason why I stopped using it.",0.0
"I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review.This product is amazing. The consistency and texture is like butter and almost bouncy to the touch.

This is a well-priced product for the results.",1.0
"I bought this product mainly because I’ve never had a lip sleeping mask before and when I smelled it in the store, I loved it. The price was great and I thought it was a great deal. I hate the feeling of dry lips and mine has a tendency to peel (and bleed) when they’re dry. Figuring this lip mask would be the perfect way to avoid that overnight, I added it to my nighttime routine. The first two days were great. My lips were soft and they felt nice. However, Day 3-7 were another story. Every morning, I’d wake up with my lips being very dry; one small movement and my lips would crack. I kept trying it for the rest of the week and the state of my lips didn’t improve. A few days after I stopped using this, I noticed that my lips were getting better. It took almost another week before everything was back to normal. I did end up returning the product, and I really, really can’t recommend it to anyone.",0.0

"I am giving a one star review simply because this is too overpriced for what it doesn’t do. I have combination skin, acne prone and have been using acids and retinoids since I had a nasty bout of hormonal acne when I turned 22 and have had to been on them ever since as I refuse to take birth control. Anyways you can say I need a TON of moisture and don’t think I don’t use ton of serums and whatnot to keep my skin moisturized. It speaks volumes that in combination with a ton of hydrating serums that this cream DRIED out my skin. Every night I would use it in lieu of my usual nighttime moisturizer, the Olay Fragrance Free (purple jar) and would wake up with dry skin. I decided to do a test where I would use this for a solid week then switch back to my Olay moisturizer and the differences was truly outstanding. I mean, my skin even looked cracked some mornings I would use this product. For the prices they are charging, this is unacceptable. The only pro I can think of that despite the fragrance it did not make me break out. Reading reviews I see that I have a vast difference experience from a lot of people, so if you are going to try out this product do not get the full size, get the trial size its enough to last you two weeks which is how long mine lasted and enough for me to make up my mind about this.",0.0
"The idea of this product is great! Hybrid products can be nice but they can also be horrible (2-in-1 shampoo, I’m talking to you).

I know this cleanser has a cult following but it was super drying on my skin. Just for reference I have oily skin and my favorite cleanser of all time is Kate Somerville goat milk cleanser.  I decided to give this a try because every influencer on YouTube was singing its praise and the thousands of positive comments here. I used this as a second cleanse in my double cleanse system.  It left my skin feeling dry and tight. After a few days of use my skin started to get itchy.  At first I thought the use of Retinol was causing the dryness so I took that out of my routine entirely and the dryness and itchiness continued.  I read thru the ingredients of this cleanser and I dont see anything I would be allergic to. I removed the cleanser out of my routine and my skin is back to normal.  This is just not for me.,0.0

I’m pretty sensitive, so I was a little nervous to try this at first, but all I got was some very mild tingling, and I’ve been using it regularly with no issues. I really like the pump packaging. One pump is enough to cover my face; you might need two if you do your neck as well. A fantastic product from DE! Try the mini size if the price freaks you out, but you might just end up shelling out after all!",1.0

I’ve gone through three tubes of this over the years and always forget how much I love it until I open a new one.

I was only able to test this product for about 3 days because It continued to irritate my skin the longer I used it. The irritation happened around my nose which is usually the most sensitive area.

I have combination skin and when used on my dry area (around my mouth) the toner aggravated my skin and made it excessively dry and flakey. I stopped using it around my mouth and it went back to normal in a few days.",1.0
"What I liked about this SPF is it has niacinamide in the main ingredients.But it leaves this glowy and oily finish on my skin that I don’t like,  besides I have oily skin.If you don t have the tolerance to niacinamide it is not for you, because it can cause dry patches in your skin",0.0

"I am a huge Drunk Elephant fan, and use most products regularly, but this sunscreen is a rare miss. It’s not bad, it’s just not great. Feels too heavy on, especially under makeup. Really hoping they have a reformulated sunscreen in development because I would love a full routine that works for me from them.",0.0
"I tried a sample and definitely not buying full sized, feels so heavy in the skin and leaves your face completely sticky",0.0
I have very large pores and was pleasantly surprised by this product this was given to me as a sample from influencer. I went out and bought the product since and it really does blare out the blemishes on your face and my pores look so much smaller the only thing I would say that I would change is I feel it’s a little sticky with application overall this is a great product if you are looking to smooth and balance your skin,1.0
I wanted to love this product but I felt like my lips were more dry and almost irritated the next morning for whatever reason. There may be an ingredient that just didn’t agree with my skin.  I ended up returning.,0.0
it’s okay. I didn’t see any anti-aging. it smells good though. kind of just a moisturizer,0.0
It does what it claims but probably not going to be buying again.,0.0
This is an awesome product to take your skin to the next level. It helped with my hormonal acne breakouts. I have fewer now and they don’t last as long. It also helped with my skin’s over all texture and dark spots. Its not magic or an overnight cure but its now a core part of getting and maintaining my skin in great shape!,1.0
"As much as I wanted to love this product, being dedicated to this brand with the rest of my skincare, I just can’t say I did. The scent of this product was not pleasing at all, unfortunately had sort of an expired stench. Also, left my skin with a film that did not feel great, having to do a second cleanse to rinse that away. The only reason I added an extra star, bringing it up to two, is that it did remove all of my makeup with a single cleanse.",0.0
"I received the trial size and after three uses I ordered the full size. This makes taking heavy eye makeup so much easier. No burning, no stinging, just rub it on your lids and wash. Perfect for any type of makeup.",1.0
"I received this product through Influenster and wanted to wait a little bit before I made a review. This toner didn’t do much for me, but I have included it into my nightly routine now. The product has a nice subtle scent and it cleans my face well after I cleanse. When I first started using it I broke out, but because I was using a new product. I also haven’t noticed a whole lot of brightening or dark spot helping, but it could take a while to see the ffects",1.0
"I really enjoyed getting to try this product out. It made my skin feel really soft and hydrated. I can’t say that this would be something that I would wanna spend the money on, but if you’re looking to splurge on a skin care product this would be a great product for you.",1.0
It’s a super cute product and all however I didn’t notice much of a difference after using it for some tome now. It was moisturizing but didn’t do much ofher than that. Wouldn’t repurchase but I didn’t hate the product.,0.0
"I received these products for free from Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review. I have really mixed feelings. The texture is great, more of a gel cream, which is what I like for my combo skin, and it sinks into your skin without leaving you greasy or a fill. HOWEVER.... this is not worth the price. 15 mLs for $22 is a lot of money. I plan on finishing it, because I do like it, then keeping the container for travel. I just can’t justify this price when this is nearly identical to how my skin feels after I use my cerave products.",0.0
"I wanted to love this product so badly, but after using it three times I wasn’t able to handle the feeling of the weird film it left on my face, and the pilling. Keep in mind this is completely on it’s own without anything overtop, I didn’t dare layer it with makeup. It does make the skin look glowy without being greasy upon application, but it doesn’t feel nice at all throughout the day. I returned it and said the cashier had two people before me return the product with the same complaints within the hour.",0.0
"Not sure if I just haven’t used enough of this product or what? I use St. Tropez before trying Isle of Paradise to try to get more product for less $$. But, I was disappointed, I bought the spray also which is better than the droplets in my opinion. This has an Orange looking glow around the hairline also even after exfoliating.",0.0

"This product is life changing. The amount of moisture you get after using this is insane. I’m only 22 and I started taking collagen because no product could bring me any type of moisture, not even oils. However, after using this even after the first time, my skin was baby soft. Like no other product. It also even makes my pores completely disappear!!! I’m not even sure if that’s listed, but I can’t say enough good things about this product. Love it so much. If you are looking for a moisturizing product, this is definitely it hands down.",1.0
"I’ve waited a month to review as my skin tends to react well with products for a couple of weeks then just stop entirely. My face is soooo oily, I typically have a literal slime slick on my forehead by noon. I’ve started using this twice a day, morning and night and my skin has dried so much using this I no longer have to blot at all throughout the day. Initially found that it would pill badly on my skin, so I went from using four drops to two and patting it in. This is definitely a product where a little goes a LONG way. It’s dried my skin so much that I had to switch foundations. I was using the Hourglass Immaculate liquid foundation and it was flaking and caking on my forehead. I’ve also ended up with a couple dry flaky patches on the sides of my nose but exfoliating makes these go away and it’s worth it not to be a constant greaseball. I will definitely keep using this, it works so well and the price can’t be beat.",1.0

This product does not irritate or burn the skin, which I love! It works great at making my skin feel smooth. I noticed after a few uses my skin looking a lot better. The only downside is that it is very expensive.",1.0
"I love this Hyaluronic cream. It feels very soothing and hydrating on the skin. When applying it on my face it feels so soft on the skin and it absorbs nicely into the skin. It has a slight fruity scent to it, nothing overwhelming. I love how my skin looks everytime I use this.",1.0
Great moisturizer.  It will better for me in the spring and summer.  Not as moisturizing as I would like.  My face is extremely dry in the winter and I need a thicker moisturizer.,1.0
Its okay I guess. Definitely not worth the price. I got a mini as a sample and it was great. But then I got the full size and it just congeals on my skin. It is hydrating and it makes my complexion look good but I cant deal with the congealment. I’m just gonna go back to using Kinship. Its way cheaper and it works fine.,0.0
"tbh this doesn’t pair well with redness from acne, it just makes my skin look full of different colours other than evened out skin tone and it made it look oily",0.0

Hard to apply because it’s like water. Doesn’t seem to absorb well. I wish it was more of a gel consistency. I would not pay full price for this thin liquid.,0.0
I received this product complementary from Influenster and Belif for reviewing purposes. Wow I’m shocked how much I love this product. I’ve used a lip mask before but it felt chalky in my lips through the night and stinging. But this brand is amazing it keeps my lips nourished and soft through the night. I felt a little sugar in the product but very light you can almost not know it’s in the balm. It hydrated my lips and they felt so good after a bad week or cold weather. My lips were chapped and now they feel softer and healthy. I want to use this treatment mask all the time. It may not be the lip mask you hear about but I love it. I’ll be buying some soon to replenish my sample.,1.0
I’m disappointed - I heard great things about this but it did nothing special for me. I’ve tried other sleeping masks (cheaper options) that worked wonders and I assumed this would be better...but alas it didn’t even work as well as the more affordable options. I think part of the issue is that it’s a thinner formula that rubs off quicker when I sleep. Not a repurchase.,0.0
"Works great, must try product but I would not recommend this to use daily since it’s a chemical peel. And also once you apply this product make sure you don’t expose to sun at-least for two days",1.0
I have crazy dry skin and i got this in hopes it would help with the flaking under my foundation. It doesn’t do anything at all. Really wanted to like this product but unfortunately it’s just a waste of money and a gimmick. Super disappointed and won’t be buying again :(,0.0
I had tried these and they worked amazing so I decided to try some cheaper ones that I could order from other places. Nothing else works even close. Some of the other brands slip off and they don’t shrink the pimple the way that these do.  These are pure magic.,1.0

"After trying multiple Tatcha products a year ago, I was converted to a faithful believer. I fell in love with the rice powder and the dewy moisturizer in particular. I don’t buy this all the time because I can’t always stomach the price, but a few months ago I decided to treat myself and buy again. I’ve been SO disappointed to the point I can’t stand using this. Previously, this moisturizer felt so wonderful, melting into your skin and feeling like it is absolutely worth the splurge. Now it feels greasy and almost like petroleum jelly in a very uncomfortable way - like I want to wash it off as soon as it’s on. I can’t imagine anything other than a formula change and tragically I won’t be repurchasing. I’ve found myself consistently reaching for Dr Jart Ceramidine and Neutrogena Water Boost instead.",0.0
"It’s just OK. I don’t notice a difference when using it, face feels no different afterwards and doesn’t look any different. Can’t wait till the bottle is finished so I can buy something else. The good thing about it is that it’s gentle on the skin.",0.0
"So I know you’re supposed to put the dot on a ready-to-pop pimple but if you’re anything like me, you simply can’t help yourself to not pop that thing. So I do! But that’s where Peace Out acne dots come in. Usually after you pop a zit, you’ll have oily drainage that eventually dries and turns into another scab, which I inevitably pick and leaks, and it’s a never ending process. But now, I pop my zit, wash my face and slap on an acne dot that ABSORBS that oil instead of leaving it to dry and turn into a scab on my face. While also reducing inflammation and redness. So when I wake up, the zit I popped is healed instead of looking way worse than it did to begin with which is usually the case. Now, I’m not recommending you pop your zit because I know it’s not good for you. BUT if you’re a picker like me, it might just make popping them a little more easy on your face.",1.0

"I decided to choose this as a free sample as I’ve had issues with my moisturizer pilling, so I was looking to try something new and I am SO glad I chose this item. I have dry, acne prone skin and having used this product for the first time I must say I am very impressed. Before bed, I used Dr Dennis Gross Daily Peel and a vitamin c serum then used this moisturizer and my face is the softest it has ever been a while. I am 100% going to buy the full version of this product.",1.0
"I wanted to love this, I really did, but my skin seems to hate everything I try from Tatcha. This cleanser left my skin horribly dried out, which was even more of a bummer because it’s advertised as being suited for dry skin. I didn’t enjoy the scent and the product had a gritty texture that irritated my skin. Maybe this would be better for people with an oilier skin type, but if you have dry, sensitive skin like I do, imo stay away from this cleanser.",0.0
"Wanted to love this so bad…sadly, it doesn’t do much or enough to get me to reach for it more often.  Glad I tried the mini size though. This foams up nicely, not strong smelling (more of a muted scent).  Much prefer the Thermafoliant for a stronger exfoliating experience.   This is much milder form of exfoliate, good if you’re starting out with exfoliants.",0.0

This stuff made my lips sooo chapped when they where not chapped at all before using . I even have a crack down my bottom lip & I only used it for three days ! I looked at the ingredients and that’s rose smell is straight fragrance. I think that’s the culprit. I will be sticking with my Aquaphor.,0.0
"I recently received the NEW Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50. I’ve been using it daily under my makeup. I’m already in love. My makeup looks AMAZING. I tend to not like sunscreen on my face or under my makeup. This lotion is different! My face didn’t break out. It gave a light glow to my skin, but definitely wasn’t greasy. It’s super lightweight and absorbs into the skin very nicely. This sunscreen is a gentle chemical and mineral sunscreen. It also has amazing skincare properties; niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and aloe. Be advised it does have a light watermelon scent that doesn’t linger throughout the day. This is now my favorite sunscreen for the face!",1.0
I loved this product it smelled almost like baby lotion and is super light and moisturizing,1.0
The texture is very smooth and light which I enjoy with all my face creams. The smell is an added plus and I love how smooth my face feels with just by using it a few days already.  I enjoy knowing my face is getting all the wonderful nutrients that helps to keep my face hydrated and moisturized. I think this mask will always stay in my night time facial routine and I highly recommend it for others as well. I received this product for free on testing purposes only.,1.0
"I really love this serum. I have noticed my skin improving as I’ve been using it. It has a light, subtle fragrance which I don’t mind. My pores look smaller, my fine lines look softer, and my makeup has been going on really nicely after applying it. I layer it with my Belif Aqua Bomb moisturizer and I have been so happy with this combination. I will definitely be either repurchasing this serum or looking into another Niacinamide serum because it appears to be a great ingredient for my oily skin.",1.0

This serum feels amazing on your face. I highly recommend using it if you are prone to breaking out because I am and it was amazing and never once broke me out.

"Took my lips from extremely dry and chapped to normal with one use. After my second use, my lips were soft AF. I use it a few times a week now to keep my lips fully hydrated.

This smells great. The lemon really comes through. I like the texture and it feels so smooth on your face! I woke up this morning and my face was really soft.

"I have acne-prone skin and have tried using this a few times to cover up acne redness. My skin gets very oily throughout the day. One thing I liked about this correcting treatment is that it does indeed blend into your skin after dabbing and massaging it into your skin. However, I disliked how it does feel and looks slightly greasy on the skin. Not only that but it also clings to my dry patches like crazy and enhances my dry patches as well. Again, my skin is extremely oily but any dryness that I had was brought out by this correcting treatment. I really wanted to love this correcting treatment and desperately wanted it to be able to help tint my redness but I just can’t stand the way it looks on my skin. I still think it would work well for others though just not me.",0.0
"Would definitely not recommend on sensitive skin. I received this as a mini trio with my purchase at Sephora and I have to say, the creams that came with this mini trio leave my skin glows & smooth for days!!!!

"I bought this because of previous success with this brand and the affordable price point. Unfortunately, both my boyfriend and I have tried this and could not see any difference. It is a little drying too, so if you use more than the tiniest of drops it makes it difficult for me to wear concealer in that area. Did not have any other negative effects though.",0.0

I use acne dots usually and those won’t work to get these pimples away. I will not use this product again.",0.0
The cream consistency was so thick it was hard to spread evenly! Plus it clogged my pores so much that it broke me out and I never do! Not even when I was a teen. I really don’t get the hype or the exaggerated price! There’s better products out there for so much less that do a way better job,0.0

Got this as a deluxe sample (thankfully) and I’m not a  fan. I’ve never really used toner before so maybe it’s just not for me but my face felt sticky and like a film was over it. I’ve used it twice and now my face is has started to break out. This is definitely not for me:(,0.0

"I liked this product at first. It is fast absorbing, albeit a little runny. It has a slight soapy smell, which I attribute to the sunflower oil. It did make my skin feel smooth, even though I didn’t really get that glowy effect.

My pores shrunk significantly, skin texture is baby bottom smooth, and my skin tone is so even it’s like I put on tinted moisturizer. WHAT IS THIS MAGIC?!?!?!",1.0
I really like this cleanser. It feels hydrating almost while using and I like its consistency on my face when it foams up.

"It’s very thick and sticky, definitely takes a second to warm up with your fingers to spread more easily. I don’t feel like it’s super hydrating once it’s on and I definitely don’t still feel it in the morning when I wake up",0.0
"The idea of a matte moisturizer appealed to me as I’ve got tricky combination skin. Oily in some parts but completely dry in the others. I was hoping this would help to balance out my skin and leave it looking even and not shiny. I’ve tried to give this moisturizer a chance, but I’m not feeling any more moisturized, and putting it on before my makeup in the morning, it crumbles off and feels like there’s a residue on my face. This product is not for me. HOWEVER, I did also receive the origins original skin clay mask with this product, and I LOVED that. I definitely felt my skin feel softer and re-energized.",0.0
"My skin was feeling drier than usual, so I included the aqua bomb into my night time skin regimen. After one use I could definitely feel that my skin was softer and more hydrated. It’s been about one week since I began using this daily and I haven’t noticed any negative reactions.",1.0
This was an OK product. It did pull dirt and grime out of my face but would burn a little when using. I do have very sensitive skin so that could be why there was a little burning. It would not make my face overly red which was also nice.,0.0
"I’ve never written a review before but felt compelled to for this product. UFO oil has changed my skin and given me my confidence back. I’ve struggled for years with cystic (hormonal) acne after going off the pill. My skin is especially bad when I’m stressed. I’ve tried everything from home remedies to prescription medication and nothing has ever helped in time of skin flare ups. I’ve been using this oil for a month and the huge pimples on my chin are gone. I’ve felt smaller ones start to come to the surface but they never formed into those huge, painful bumps that I was used to. I love this oil and I love that I can feel confident being out in public without makeup on!!",1.0
"Dermalogica has such great products and the Daily Microfoliant is no exception! I found it to be effective, but not too much. This is a rice-based powder cleanser that exfoliates skin of any type. Great for traveling too! I received a sample of this gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.",1.0
I really wanted to like this product and there were things I did like about it. The soft feel when I put it on and the lack of crazy fragrances. Unfortunately the first time I used it I broke out. I switched back to My normal one and it cleared up. I tried again and I broke out again. I did get this product free to review,0.0
It’s a very lightweight moisturizer that has a bit fo a runny consistency. I like it because it makes me face look really dewy but the smell is quite strong (more so than the cleansing balm). I should mention that I like to put another moisturizer on top that’s heavier and creamier to seal all the moisture in because of how light weight this moisturizer is. I don’t think I’ll repurchase it though to be honest - there are better moisturizers in the market.,0.0
My lips have never been smoother or more moisturized. I put this on nightly with the little spatula - a little goes a long way - and it has made a huge difference since night one. I highly recommend this and it is totally worth the $20.,1.0

This mask is amaaaazing! It is lightweight but gets the job done. I’ll be flying to NY in a few days and I can’t wait to wear this mask. It’s so impressive that this can also be used as a primer. I absolutely love it!,1.0
I was so excited to try this stick. I have combination skin under my eye and I thought it will work perfectly. The stock is hard and it’s not easy to apply. Very disappointed.,0.0

"I use this product for two weeks and I have to say I am disappointed. I really enjoyed how moisturizing this sunscreen was, as well as how I felt when I plan on my face. When I did not like is that after weeks of use I began to develop cystic acne as well as black heads and white heads. Not using this again.",0.0

"A cute scrub, gave a nice glow and make skin softer but the effect doesn’t last that long— broke out after second use. Maybe try youth to the people’s exfoliant mask if you’re willing to jump in the higher price range or go the ordinary for their AHA mask if you want to go to the lower price range. Overall, I will most likely not be repurchasing.",0.0
"I’ve been loving this serum, first the smell is so relaxing as if I was at a spa. My skin feels so hydrated and looks so moisturized right after applying. It’s so soothing to my skin. I apply this morning and night. It mixes well with other products. If your looking for a serum that gives you a glow and makes your skin look healthy this is the one.",1.0
This is aholy grail face cleanser for my combination skin. It gets rid of excess sebum (face oil) without stripping the skin and drying it out or screwing with the face’s natural ph level. Try it and I don’t think you’ll regret it!,1.0
"Apparently, the inkey line isn’t for my skin type. I had the same reaction when I tried the hyaluronic acid. I broke out with dry red patches. So currently I’m walking around with dry raised scaly patches under my eyes.",0.0
Love how it made my face feel clean and fresh! got it as a sample in my PLAY box. Bought it because I loved it.. I even refilled my sample bottle for my daughter to try it. she loved it too.,1.0
"This is okay. I am halfway through the tube. I have sensitive skin and it does not break me out. Like with all hydrating masks, I apply this as an overnight mask. It hydrates, but it isn’t the best thing I’ve ever tried. I will finish it because I refuse to waste, but I don’t enjoy applying this product like I do with my other skincare products. I prefer a hydrating gel mask so I will not repurchase this, but if you are looking for a basic cream mask and don’t mind paying this amount, then go for it.",0.0
It is one of the favorite serum. I will buy it from time to time. Don’t stop making them,1.0
"I have combo skin and struggle to find a moisturizer that won’t clog my pores while being moisturizing and will not make my t-zone oily. This moisturizer is it. It glides on and lives up to its name by having a pseudo gel-water-like texture. It’s very lightweight and can be worn under make up. It doesn’t budge when I prime or put my cc cream over. At he end of the day, after wearing makeup for 9 hours my t-zone is usually not oily but on the rare occasion (hi hormones) it’s the slightest bit oily. When used as a night time moisturizer, I wake up with such soft skin without the oil slick.",0.0
"Okay, I love this eye cream (and all of DE’s products for that matter)... this is a super hydrating, never irritating silky formula. but, does anyone else notice how quickly a bottle of this goes? Most eye creams are 0.5 oz, and last me about 2.5 months. This one did not last 1 month. I couldn’t believe when it was empty. Makes it kind of steep to purchase regularly.",1.0
"I’ve tried this product on and off for about 6 months trying to pinpoint which of my new skincare treatments are making my skin breakout. I’ve decided to get educated on ingredients in my skincare and this is NOT a good choice for us with acne prone skin!! There are many pore clogging components, and probably not a lot of lactic acid since it’s so far down on the list of ingredients! I do like the Luna oil that came with the Good Genes but I don’t see any skin changes from that, just a soft face in the morning.",0.0

"I genuinely am enjoying this weightless hydrating skin cream! I received a sample size free for testing purposes and 3 months in I’m just about out and highly considering purchasing a full size when I finish some other owned products first. I use this nightly before bed, the formula glides on abs absorbs instantly. It’s creamy with a bit of oil, feels luxurious!",1.0
"Meh just really didn’t like this, I’ve got so many other better creams already, but had gotten a sample of this. I found it had a string weird smell almost like rubber or plastic - very chemically and offputting. I also put two layers of it on because by skin still felt dry after the first. I don’t HATE it, but would definitely recommend other stuff over this.",0.0
I absolutely loved this whipped moisturizer. my skin feels smooth and soft. I also like the smell of the product. it’s not greasy or filmy.,1.0
"I love this lip mask - I actually use a lighter amount during the day, on top of a bit of lip colour. It has just the slightest hint of colour to it, very natural looking. I have dry lips, especially in the winter so this is a life saver for me. I slather it on at night as it really works! I also bought it for my sister and she felt the exact same way about how great it is. Totally worth it!",1.0

"After hardly a week of using this product, my lips began to feel MORE dry and cracked and got so irritated. My lips are rough with a strange texture and I’m just hoping it doesn’t get worse and stops now that I’ve stopped using the product. Should have looked at the ingredient list before, but now I see it has dyes and harsh chemicals! No wonder my lips are WORSE off after using this! Biggest waste of money on a product, DO NOT BUY!",0.0
"I got a sample of the mask and tried it. My skin felt dry and it needed a boost of moisture. When I applied it to my face, It felt cool against my skin. When I removed it, my face felt dewy and it looked smooth. I recommend it.",1.0
It’s just a little gritty so a mild exfoliating scrub. I bought it because I thought it would smell like strawberries. It smells strongly like ginger to me. There are way better scrubs out there for the price.,0.0
"i bought this on whim after seeing it in store, having previously seeing it in an email promo. i was looking for a new day time moisturizer, as my usual was just ‘ok’. it’s a thick consistency, but i haven’t had any problems with putting other products on top or under it. it’s great for nighttime as well, i wake up and the usual dryness on my cheeks has all but completely resolved. it’s been about a week but i am pleasantly surprised with how much i like this product.",1.0
"I tried a few bottles of this product bc estheticians rave about it but honestly it didn’t do much for me. The scent is a bit interesting; personally it didn’t bother me but it varies per person. Given the fact that I didn’t notice much difference, I won’t be repurchasing esp with this price point.",0.0

"Very thick feeling so I use it at night, but when I wake up my face feels amazing. I highly recommend for dry or combination skin. I also love to use this on the ends of my hair, I put it in when it’s damp and when it dries your damaged hair is soft.",1.0
"I got this as part of the samples bag since I wanted to try Kiel’s products.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the consistency is odd-very goopy and slimy.  When applied to the under eye area, it leaves a shiny film. While ok for bedtime use, it looks too strange to use for daytime.   I rarely use concealer or foundation, so it really stands out.  It seems to moisturize well, but hasn’t done much for my fine lines and puffiness.   I’ll probably use up the small sample I got, but won’t purchase a full size.",0.0
By far the best lip balm ever. After using accutane in my teens which destroyed my lips I’ve tried everything to keep them from looking dry and use this AM and PM. It’s awesome and worth the money. Will buy again when I run out of this giant jar in the year 2036.,1.0
Irritated my sensitive acne prone skin. My skin around the eyes turned red and stung from these. Use a cleansing balm instead!,0.0
"Great for the price point! I added this into my routine as the first step of a double cleanse. Note that you should be rubbing this into dry skin, then washing off with water! That really makes the difference.",1.0
"Just like every other review, the packaging for this product is very pretty and cute. I wanted to love this product but after using it for a month or so, I don’t really see it doing anything great for my skin. It has a sticky feeling and you really have to pat it on the skin, otherwise it streaks on your face if you rub it. It somewhat helps with hydration, but not that much.",0.0
"I’ve never heard of this brand before so I bought this product based on the high ratings. I have sensitive, acne prone skin so I was very hesitant with this product, therefore purchasing it with the salicylic acid product as well (in case I broke out). This product has been working great, minimizing pores and causing no breakouts. It does dry my skin so be sure to use a moisturizer or use every 2-3 days.",1.0
"This cleanser is terrible. I can see a lot of people love it, but it broke me out so horribly it’s taking forever to calm it down. Two days after I stopped using it, I stopped getting more breakouts and since then my skin is improving (remarkably slow), so I know it was this cleanser. I hadn’t changed anything else in my regimen. Going back to my YTTP kale cleanser.",0.0
"Unfortunately, it felt like this product just sat on top of my dry lips without improving their hydration at all. A disappointing purchase.",0.0

Absolutely love it. When purchasing I really didn’t know what I was looking for. This is so soothing and does not dry my skin out.  It leaves me with a very clean and rosy skin. I would recommend you try it.,1.0
"I love love this lip balm!! It’s so nice and moisturizing! My lips are sensitive a lot of the times! My lips get chapped and dry and sometimes there flaky skin and I love this to hydrate it. I always use the Carmex lip balm but has toxic ingredients in there and I’ve been looking for an spf lip balm with reef-safe ingredients , but haven’t found any on here. I’ll definitely will be using this though. I just use lip liner and go over with this lip balm and smudge in my liner with it and it gives my lips some color and a sexy pout. Gave it 4 stars because the price is too high and this runs out pretty fast-only downfall.",1.0
I really like this cream! It’s not too thick to where you can’t rub it in but it glides over your skin. My skin looks glowy after applying and fees really plump and healthy. My skin feels soft and not sticky after application,1.0
"This product is actually really good and my daughter loves it!! I gave it 3 stars because I have sensitive skin and eyes, and it burns my eyes every time time I use it. The texture and scent is amazing, it rinses off really nice too. Unfortunately for me, it leaves a waxy residue which I’m don’t really like.",0.0
"My favorite moisturizer of all time. For those of you who don’t like heavy, thick products, this is a dream cream. It has a beautiful, mild, clean fragrance. It’s light, and cool on the skin, spreads easily, and absorbs beautifully after a minute or two. It’s absolutely refreshing, and brings to mind summer cucumbers - even though I know it’s got kale and green tea as its ingredients. It’s a wonderful product if you tend to layer with serums, because it helps to keep things nice and light.  Love YTTP products in general, and this lovely moisturizer will always be part of my regular skin care routine.",1.0
"Excellent for prepping and priming you’re skin or leaving on as an overnight mask. It does have a little tingle to it which feels kinda weird at first, but then really nice! This will be my new go-to moisturizing mask.",1.0
These cotton pads are awesome - you can feel the difference from cheap drugstore ones. Four star for Sephora because at Hudson Bay they are two bucks cheaper!,1.0
I really like this cream. I struggled to find one that didn’t make my face oily. It left my face feel moistures and it shrunk my pores!,1.0
"Grabbed this as an impulse purchase at checkout. Feels nice going on, but quickly wears off. The large applicator is awkward. Not worth the money.",0.0
Not worth the price. It compares to any other drug store moisturizer.,0.0
Product pills so badly!! Can’t be used under makeup at all. The only reason I gave two stars is because the glow it gives is gorgeous.,0.0

I used this product as a hair oil to combat dry and flaky scalp and it did not disappoint me. It hydrated my scalp without weighing down my fine hair. I will definitely purchase it again.,1.0
Somehow made me oilier than the original?? The shade is horrible. It instantly oxidized to carrot orange. It looks very dull and lifeless on the skin. Not worth it.,0.0

"I’ve heard such rave reviews about everything and anything by Drunk Elephant, but I’m not impressed. The diameter is too large for this product so it ends up getting all over my skin around my lips.

Perfect.  Moisturizes for the day without scent.  Just what I needed.  Glad to go back to a favorite.,1.0
I don’t hate it but for me it’s not doing anything to my face. Well maybe i have to wait more weeks to see a difference. But all in all i love that it glides easily and absorbed instantly by the skin so no greasy feeling. Love the smell too and the color. I received this product as a complimentary but all my opinions are my own and not biased.,1.0
It’s just ok.  Not nearly rich enough moisturizing for me. Bit of an odd smell.  The dispenser is interesting.,0.0
"I received this complimentary from dermalogica sampling but have used the full size product for about 4 months and have seen good results so far. Black heads have reduced. Make sure to avoid sensitive areas. Also make sure to massage softly, the idea is to gently exfoliate not to strip off your skin. If this is done correctly then you will see your skin clear up!",1.0
"I’ve been using this for about a month. It is gentle enough for everyday use which is nice for people with sensitive skin, but I honestly don’t feel the slightest tingle or any indication that the active ingredient is powerful enough to do anything. I know that my skin doesn’t look any better for having used it daily and I will probably go back to using Good Genes after this is empty. Super overpriced for no results.",0.0
got a deluxe sample of this and broke my face in tiny tiny  bumps like all over.,0.0
Absolutely love it! My skin is glowing and looks so fresh.,1.0
"Burned so bad I had to wash it out. I would not recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin. (I got it as a free sample and only got one pad so I could not patch test). I’m usually not in favor of at home peeling because there is no professional to help out if some reaction happens, especially because my skin is very sensitive. May be good for other people though. Smell is good by the way",0.0
Completely drys out the skin and leaves a weird residue. I do not recommend!!!!,0.0
"I’ve used so many products containing acid fighting ingredients, but this was a game changer! I saw no results until I added this product into my skin care routine. It reduces inflammation soooo much & made my pores noticeably smaller. I was hesitant at first because the first time I used it it made my skin & acne sting, but it made such a huge difference! definitely a new staple in my routine.",1.0
"I initially tried this product out as a sample but loved it so much I bought the full size version. Honestly this makes your skin feel super velvety and very smooth but not oily like other face serums like farsali. This is also multipurpose since you can use it on your hair, especially split-ends and your neck and elbows. The smell takes a while to get used too, its kind of nutty but once you get over it the product is still definitely worth it and pretty underrated.",1.0
"Delicious smell and great product! It doesn’t have a overpowering lemon scent rather a clean and light scent that goes beautiful with the product. It is a amazing scrub and leaves my skin so clean. I am addicted to it and it didn’t leave my skin feeling dry. It’s a must try product, I will be getting another one for sure!",1.0
Instant positive effects,1.0
"Used this for summer months, and it was great for being a sheer tint to brighten your face on a humid day. Beware, not for dry skin! Ive used this in the winter months over any acne or dry skin. The sheen will stick to it and emphasize it!!! Otherwise smells nice and works well.",1.0
"I used this serum to help tighten my pores. When I first applied it, it felt sticky. When it dried down my skin felt nice and smooth. My pores look tighter and it helped a little wit my blemishes.

"I rarely write reviews on products but this toner is worthy of a review. I didn’t have bad acne but I’d occasionally get breakouts due to my monthly visitor. I’ve been using this toner for over a year and my skin is the best it’s ever looked. I obsess over having good texture and clear skin and this product has definitely improved my skin to the max. I rarely get a pimple since I’ve been using this. Yes, a pimple! That’s how much it’s helped control my acne. It also wears well under my makeup which is a huge plus. It feels a little tacky after use but it’s worth it",1.0
it honestly doesnt do much. i have been using this every night and my lips still get dry. i exfoliate and put this on after. it doesnt really do anything. looks nice though,0.0
"I was genuinely excited to try the product after seeing all the hype on TikTok but once I applied onto my skin it didn’t look right.

I had to return it sadly, was really hoping it would work out.",0.0

I received this product in a complimentary VoxBox from Influenster so I tried it for a few days and it didn’t do much for me but again I don’t really have any dark spots. It did improve the feel of my skin which is nice but to give an honest review I needed to see it in action so I used my mom as a tester. My mother has dealt with dark spots her whole life and I have to say I was surprised to see the difference in her skin. The size and color of many of her spots have diminished and the fine lines on her forehead have also been reduced so much so that she stopped wearing foundation everyday.,1.0

The great part about this cream is hydrating without causing milia. However I am in my late 20s so I don’t expect much from an eye cream besides the moisturizing effect. It doesn’t seem to do anything for dark circles. I didn’t see any brightening effect. I like the cream but I wouldn’t recommend it for this price. I received this product complementary for testing purposes.,0.0

No no it is cute but it just made my dry skin more dry and my pores bigger and no. Just no.,0.0
"This really doesn’t do anything. Kind of leaves a sticky film around your eyes and smells super weird. Yes, it feels good for the first five seconds but now I am stuck with a weird rash (either from this product or from the Watermelon serum) and applying aquaphor every 20 minutes. Not worth it. Packaging is cool though.",0.0
This product for some reason did not work for me. I had high hopes because of all the great reviews but t skin continued to break out. After switching cleansers when this one ran out my skin started clearing. It didn’t make me break out more but didn’t do anything to help the current situation. Do not recommend for dry skin types with some texture.,0.0
"I took the Tatcha skin routine questionnaire and I was assigned this cleanser.I used the entire bottle and I was totally unimpressed, I have combination skin and it tends to break out from time to time and if anything I broke out more when I used this cleanser.I also got many patches of dry skin while using this cleanser but when I use Cerave those patches are non-existent. I also hated the package component, tatcha’s packaging is usually so luxe and beautiful but this dingy plastic bottle begins to crack after a few squeezes, leave pieces of blue plastic shards lodged into your hands. It’s also very difficult to get the right amount out of the bottle because you have to squeeze the glops out which leads to a lot of waste.",0.0

Do not recommend for acne prone skin. Just feels like a very thick face wash that is similar to neutrogena or some cheap over the counter Walmart face wash. If you’re paying this much money for a face wash it better have the key ingredients and this product just has 0 benefits & no key ingredients to help cleanse skin and reduce acne or other breakouts. Over priced,0.0
"Unfortunately I’m not loving this product, it just seems it’s not fit for me. I’m not sure if it interacted bad with other products I was using, or what went wrong, but I experienced some cystic breakouts while using that seamed they weren’t healing. After discontinuing use, they’ve started healing rapidly and my skins looking much better. Besides the breakouts I didn’t notice any other results, maybe this product is for more mature skin as I’m only 22 and don’t need much antiaging yet.",0.0

This cream made my face break out almost immediately after first use. I also found that it was extremely greasy and had a strange odor. I was expecting this to be a good option for my sensitive skin in the winter.,0.0
Doesn’t work. I think it actually made my acne worse. Plus the sulfur can get everywhere (including in my eyes),0.0
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I have dry combination skin and sometimes it can be challenging finding a product that provides soothing hydration. I immediately felt a surge in moisture and smoothness in my skin. I used it for a few days and continued to see benefits. I received this product for free for testing and review.,1.0
"I wanted to love this under eye cream because I’m a huge fan of BELIF Aquabomb Moisturizing Gel, but this product ended up being one of my biggest skincare regrets! After a week of applying this at night (a very thin layer, w/o any other products), I noticed a ton of very small milia starting to appear exactly where I had applied it. Luckily, you can’t see them unless you’re super close, but it’s a lot and they’re impossible to get rid of. Also, be very careful to only apply the thinnest later of this product otherwise it will start pilling ($45 product down the drain!). I’ll give it 2 stars because it does a great job of making your under-eye area look and feel very hydrated.",0.0
"I use this product in my eveveryday skincare routine. A little goes a very long way. If you have combo skin, I recommend just using this cream in your dryer areas. A dab will do ya. This product is very hydrating, but if you use too much, it can look and feel pretty greasy. There was a bit of a learning curve for me with this cream, but I am so happy I figured out what works for me. I can’t really explain the scent of Tatcha products, but no other product smells the way Tatcha does. Very fresh, clean and expensive smelling.  At first, I would have subtracted a star for the price, but having this cream now for nearly a year, it seems worth it to me. I still have about a quarter of the container left while still using it everyday. Highly recommend!",1.0
I was hesitant that this product wouldn’t live up to the hype surrounding it but IT DOES! My lips feel hydrated and have a lovely shine without being sticky or looking greasy. I just finished a tub of this and am currently using the Tatcha Kissu Lip Mask (not as good) to try something new but I cannot wait to finish it and get back to Laneige!!,1.0

"I’ve tried samples of this eye cream in the past and like it, and now I’ve used it for longer, I like it even better. The consistency is great. Not too thick, spreads and absorbs nicely. Smells a little like grains, but the scent is very light, hardly noticeable. Instantly hydrating but doesn’t weight it down or give me milia, it plumps up the area so my wrinkles look less pronounced. Gifted by Algenist.",1.0

"So I received this a little early, and have been using it every day for the last two weeks. I have really oily skin, so it doesn’t dry it out, which is nice, it smells great, I haven’t noticed much of a change in dark spots, but I have noticed my face as a whole looked brighter. I received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0

"Let me be frank—I’m not impressed. This product is “O.K” at best. It is decent for covering up surface level skin redness and irritation, but i’d advise against using it as an all out, “treatment.” In my brutally honest opinion, it’s more of a glorified concealer. While the green to beige technology suits my skin-tone just fine, I can totally see how this product limits itself in accessibility to other more fair or even darker skin tones. Pros: Contains SPF 30 protection, is lightweight and buildable. The product is perfect for covering minor skin imperfections not otherwise easily concealed. Made of natural ingredients, relatively odorless, and safe on sensitive skin. Con: non-universal color; not a corrector of color but rather a concealer; messy / difficult application; and leaves face feeling greasy.I’ll be honest, I don’t have severe enough redness in my face to feel like the product is truly Earth shattering for me... however, that doesn’t mean it wouldn’t be effective on the skin of someone who truly suffers from severe uneven skin tone or redness. This may very well be one of those “you have to try it for yourself” types of  situations. On that note, I do recommend you try it for yourself! It may just be the best thing ever... or just another product you may never end up using again. You’ll have to try it to find out!",0.0

"I want to love this product so bad! I have combo skin typically, but during the winter I get drier/patchier in areas around my mouth. It’s weird. This moisturizer is perfect to put on before I go to bed, but NOT if I’m about to put my foundation on. I use a matte foundation because I get very oily throughout the day with the LM translucent powder. Unfortunately when I started using this, it gave me patches around my mouth since it’s starting to get cold where I live. This stuff smells SO good though!",0.0

I’m on my third bottle. I have two in my bathroom: one in the shower and one in my shelf by my sink. It legit takes off my Kat von D waterproof eyeliner and my Dior show waterproof mascara.

"I got a sample of this for my free birthday gift (I think). It took me a little while to want to use it since I had used another Drunk Elephant product that my skin did not like. I went on a trip, which normally causes me to break out. I took this mini with me for convenience. I ended up not breaking out at all. Not even a little bit. When I got home, I kept using the mini alternately with my Boscia cleanser. My skin looked and felt great. I ended up ordering a full size. I still use it alternately with my other cleanser. I like how soft my face feels after I use this cleanser. It seems pretty gentle, so if you have sensitive skin, this might be a worthwhile try.",1.0
"I really wanted to like face mask but I could NOT! first of all the size is so small for the hefty price tag! I have other masks fromOther companies and comparing them to this one I get more product in the others and for much cheaper.

I can still smell the essence on my face even after I washed off.",0.0
A bit too gentle for my liking. I didn’t love the smell nor did I feel like it really cleaned my face.,0.0
"I received this product for free to test from Influenster.  To give the most accurate review I could, I tested this for 14 days. First of all, I applied this generously both morning and night but have barely made a dent in the overall product consumption so that is impressive. At first I was skeptical as it feels like splashing your skin with water but over time I’ve been able to see tell the positive difference it has made. I live in Phoenix so skin dryness is always an issue. Not anymore! I’ve really love to hydration and overall glow this product gives me. The product applies so lightly but really packs a punch. Absolutely zero piling under makeup or with other skincare items. I love this product and will continue to use it in my skincare regime",1.0

"I love this. At first, the smell was a little overpowering and took time to get used to, but now I enjoy putting this on at night and the smell has become a relaxing scent. I have used retinoids and spot treatments frequently in the past, so my skin was not affected at all by this addition.",1.0
This product is so great! SPF does not hurt. I wear it on it’s own and feel great. Also pairing with a finishing powder adds a nice touch. I don’t feel like I have to wear my CC cream.,1.0

"This product does an amazing job of melting away make up. It’s got a waxy texture that feels super comfortable when massaging the make up off. Also does a great job with eye make up and mascara, or I think so atleast!

I would highly recommend trying it out if you’re looking for a great make up remover!",1.0
ive gone through 3 bottles of this stuff. its great for oily skin and acne-prone skin. however i stopped using this because it aint worth the price.

"I got this free from influenster, and to be honest I’ve never been more excited about a voxbox than this one. The moisturizer is definitely heavy, and feels thick on application, but melts beautifully and doesn’t leave the feeling of something sitting on your face. It finishes with a beautiful dewy glow. I am very picky about moisturizers, and this one is great not only for the feel, but for the ingredients and the fact that it’s UNSCENTED.

Not sure how to feel about it. I had to cleanse twice and used this as a first step oil cleanser since it did not take off my make up but i already bought it... i used it to gently take off my eye make up but it doesnt take it off fully. I would go in again with la mer’s cleanser to really clean the rest of my make up off. I use minimal make up as well. On the bright side - it did not break me out! So 3 starts because im not sure how to feel about it... it did nothing.,0.0
"A sephora employee recommended me this when I told her I have acne scars, redness, and pores. I decided to give it a try. I use it daily every morning and every night. I tried it out for a month and it worked but when the second month rolled around, it didn’t work for me anymore. Instead, it gave me more breakouts and made my skin really itchy. I have sensitive combination skin. I actually have to double cleanse with a different cleanser because this cleanser just from 1 wash actually doesn’t remove any of my makeup at all and it still leaves a lot of residue. I don’t recommend buying this cleanser because it’s more of a cleanser you can use if you need a wakeup call if you’re pulling an all-nighter. It only leaves the face refreshed for like a few minutes and that feeling disappears. It didn’t really soak into my face but instead laid flat on the surface and then disappear.",0.0
"Decent moisturizer, with a pretty strong scent of herbal ingredients. This is a thicker consistency than I am used to, so I would recommend it for someone who has dry skin.",0.0

I have acne prone skin with some oily areas and dry patches. I have used one full little of this but I’m not sure I saw any dramatic change in my skin. It didn’t cause any breakouts. This product is too expensive for just a little improvement of the skin texture I won’t repurchase this. 3 stars for not causing pimples...,0.0

I’m a huge fan of The Ordinary and use a lot of their products. I needed something to get rid of the dark circles under my eyes. This product gave me bags overnight!!!

Really wanted to love this product but it balls up horribly! Tried wearing it alone or on top of moisturizer but pills no matter what. Tried multiple combinations. The glow is a bit much almost making skin look greasy. I have dry skin and am always looking for a glow. Will be returning once a tire opens as I cannot bothered with scraping the balls off my face. I love supergoop and have the everyday sunscreen and I love it! Will be exchanging for that.,0.0
I really had high hopes for this cleanser but I am not even going to finish the bottle out. The gel comes out in spurts so some times I get way more than I was expecting and feel like I wasted it. It smells nice and foams well but there are beads that do most of the exfoliation I presume. I am not a fan of that. I prefer an enzyme or micro more. I just bought the rice powder to switch out with this. I’m just not sure I thought it did anything that great for my skin besides wash it.,0.0
"I wanted to try this product out hearing such amazing things! I spread it evenly across my face and left it on for 15 minutes. Immediately after taking it off my skin was super smooth and felt amazing! The next day however was not so great. I woke up to horrible acne on my cheeks that I have not experienced in over a year. I highly doubt I was purging. I wanted to like the product but it broke me out horribly. For reference I have normal, not dry or oily skin.",0.0
"I received this moisturizer as a sample in a tarte kit. I use this after I’ve put on my tarte maracuja oil and let me tell you it has been my absolute favorite duo.

This moisturizer feels lightweight and there’s no perfumes or artificial fragrances, which i personally prefer.",1.0
Love this base! It makes my skin look so smooth plus it layers well with all of my makeup! Definitely a ten out of ten. If you have dry skin you will love this for sure! Also the packaging is super cute!,1.0
I’ve been using this for about two weeks and haven’t noticed any difference in my appearance. I do appreciate that the directions say that you may experience some slight tingling (I did) which subsides within a minute. The formula does apply easily. It isn’t drying I feel. I have very dry skin and I have some fine lines. I do have eczema and my skin did tolerate this product. I will keep using this product and see if I note any changes.,0.0
"This is the best skin care product that I use. It helped me get rid of my acne for good and gave my dull skin a brighter completion. Best of all, it is great on my sensitive skin. I have been using this product for over 2 years and it’s never failed me.",1.0
No difference after a few uses. It kind of just rolls into big clumps (as stated) but I feel like it just skims the surface without polishing skin like a normal exfoliator. I got the travel size and it’s a different formulation but that isn’t an excuse for how bad it was. Glad I didn’t purchase the full size.,0.0
I was skeptical at first because this was a powder like a grainy powder that I had to add water to. Once I started using it it worked wonderfully. It helped clear up my face and kept it clear. I haven’t really found anything else that worked as well as this. I would definitely recommend it to anyone no matter your skin type.,1.0
"I bought this because I absolutely love the sleeping mask but to be honest, I did not really like this balm. It was not hydrating at all, and it was extremely sticky. My hair kept getting in it, and my lips were honestly getting stuck together. On top of that, I didnt love the gummy bear flavour, it was weird.",0.0
"I was excited to try this after reading so many good things, but I just can’t get behind it. Although it is fragrance free, it has kind of a chemical/plastic smell to it.

"Fruit enzymes ... exfoliation ... glowing, smoother, and brighter skin. Of course that that was enticing! So why not give it a try? I used it twice a week for a few weeks as directed. The cellulose fibers created a nice exfoliation and left my skin super smooth and after a few weeks I think my skin tone was a bit more even. I wasn’t in love with the scent of the product, but it wasn’t bad enough for me to stop using it after the first time. I have combination skin and usually don’t worry about dryness however after using this for a few weeks I developed some dry skin near my nose and on the top of my cheekbones. I really wanted to love this product because it did leave my skin super smooth but it just isn’t for me.",0.0
So this stuff is pretty interesting. Love the container and smell but the formula is sticky and tacky. I have oily skin and this made it worse. I see many people like it but it’s like putting watermelon jello on your face.,0.0

I received a free sample of this cleanser and LOVED it so naturally had to buy the full size! I have extremely sensitive skin so this gentle deep clean is perfect for me. The scent is also amazing! My ONLY issue is not with the cleanser but with the bottle it comes in! Very annoying to use - a simple switch to a pump-style or a bottle that is easier to squeeze would make it the PERFECT product.,1.0
"This moisturizing cream has been a staple in my nighttime routine for the past couple months. It’s very thick and creamy but doesn’t make my sensitive skin break out - win! It looks and feels like a quality product which you’d expect for the price. My one drawback is that it does have a scent. It smells like cherry airhead candy. I will say that after a while of using it consistently, I didn’t notice the small anymore. The smell also isn’t super strong and I only smell it while applying. But, you should be aware of the scent before buying. Overall, it’s worked wonders for my skin and I would recommend the product.",1.0
"I reallllly want to love and use this every single day.  It made my foundation go on so flawlessly and i loved the lemon herbed smell it has.  It moisturized well without feeling greasy....but it made me break out.  The morning after the first time I used it i had a teeny tiny break out, and more an more followed.  I stopped using it for a week to test and it cleared up and then I used it again on a Friday evening and washed my face just a few hours later and I broke out again.   If you are not acne prone, you will likely love this.  If you break out at all, I would avoid or at the very least save your receipt.  I’m so sad because it’s such a beautiful product.  Three stars for what it can do to application and how it moisturizes and smells but had to take away two stars for how it can break you out.",0.0

I could rub my cheeks with my fingers and the product just flaked off entirely. When I applied makeup on top of it, foundation looked very cakey and dry.

"I got a sample of this to compare it to my usual hydrating leave-on mask (Origins Drink Up is my favorite). I thought considering all the hype that this would be better. It has a thicker consistency and spreads very nicely. The scent is mild. However, it stings as soon as I apply it, and the sting doesn’t go away! I have sensitive skin so I am accustomed to products stinging from time to time (even my Drink Up mask stings in the first 10 seconds), but this stings the entire time I wear it. I’m telling myself this means “it’s working“ but it shouldn’t sting for 5-10 minutes, especially since it’s not a peel or anything like that. The only comment I can add is that even though this has the Clean seal from Sephora, their criteria of what is clean is very different from mine - one look at the ingredients list of unpronounceable chemicals and it’s quite obvious this isn’t that *clean* at all.",0.0

I was so excited for this but unfortunately it really did feel like slathering on Vaseline. It didn’t really emulsify either and I immediately got several tiny whiteheads everywhere the following days.,0.0
"I’ve been using this cleanser am/pm for almost a month and my skin has completely cleared up! I haven’t had any break outs since. I do make sure so moisturize well, because this product can be drying on my skin. New holy grail for sure! I love it!",1.0
"It does feel nice on skin does an okay job at removing oil and dirt, but I took away two stars for the reason of How Bad This Smells. I just hate it. I would rather get a cleanser that deeply cleans without smelling gross, and this isn’t the deep cleanse I wanted. I recommend if you want a meh cleanse and don’t care about the smell",0.0

Definitely helps the redness go down on my acne which is great. Still have some stubborn spots this doesn’t seem to get rid of but I prefer this over other products I’ve tried because it never dries me out,1.0

"Every single Drunk Elephant product has given me terrible acne consisting of horrible and painful cystic pimples. I didn’t think that this would do the same for my skin, but it unfortunately did. Even the smallest amount broke my entire face out. I’d recommend just using a tinted sunscreen/moisturizer or a normal bronzer because the color of this wasn’t even that good either.",0.0

"I started using this after I received a sample of the Tatcha Water Cream. I feel in love with this moisturizer I have tried so many different moisturizers that works but weren’t my holy grail. I would say that Tatcha Water Cream is that for me it really locks in the moisture and leaves my skin feeling really soft and glowing. I have Combination and Dry skin so it works perfect for my skin type a little goes such a long way, also if lasts me up to 3-4 months using it a.m and p.m. My pores used to red and big but after using it it really reduced the size of my pores and redness. I been using this for months and honestly wouldn’t use any other moisturizer unless they end up changing the formula. I have really dry skin and sometimes cracked during the winter and this moisturizer helps me a lot with locking in moisture so my face doesn’t hurt from being chapped. I highly recommend giving this moisturizer a try. I will say that the sample size is on the small size as I recall. I would put a picture in but it has been awhile since I have received the sample. The size of the sample might be a normal size for a sample but I haven’t gotten much sample moisturizers since I started using Tatcha Water Cream.",1.0
"As a brand I love laneige, they make quality products and this balm doesn’t disappoint! I love that it’s ever so slightly tinted and it’s not super sticky like a lip gloss. The scent is so good that I have to stop myself from licking my lips off but it’s more of a grown up scent of what you would have had in the lip smackers balms. Upon application it stays on for a while unlike others that will fade away after a few minutes and it actually hydrates and treats dry lips. The price is more than I’d normally pay but it’s a quality product so that’s understandable. Overall I really like it.I received this free from topbox for my HONEST opinion.",1.0
Did not like it at all. It feels like wax sitting on your skin instead of it seeping into your skin. The “unscented“ smell is also foul. Smells like chalk. I wish I could return it but I’m past my 60 days. I really tried to love it.,0.0
"Not the best moisturizer out there but works for me.Pros: light scent (almost unscented), light texture, easy to apply, doesn’t break me out, great for summer, not sticky.Cons: could be more hydrating, I don’t think it’s good for winter months, not good for dry skin, the jar.Overall I love it, I’m using it as it keeps my skin clear and I love the texture. I would purchase again. And yes, I love the colour of this cream - like cappuccino.",1.0
I have dry lips. I’ve tried everything including this and it was just mediocre. I enjoy putting it on under lipstick but it does the same as my $5 hydrating lip balm.,0.0
"I’ve used this for years. I rarely use it alone, though, because it is very shimmery. If you like a lot of glow, use it alone. I usually mix this with moisturizer, self tanner, and sometimes my face oil. I customize it to get what I want. you can apply this under make up or wear it solo if you just want a glow a but protected affect. It’s a good product to have in your make up bag. I will continue to buy this.",1.0
"#charlottetilbury #MagicSerumCrystalElixir #contest #complimentary #charlottesmagiccream I was fortunate enough to receive this as a complimentary sample. I also received the Magic Serum Crystal Elixir. The cream has a luxurious balm texture which I love. I lightly ran my finger over the top of the product, picking up a small amount as it is thicker than most night creams. I then smoothed it over my hand that I had applied the elixir and it spread like butter. My hands are extremely dry due to frequent hand washing. My hand feels so smooth, silky and it looked like I put a filter on my hand! I’m turning 45 next month and I am buying the full size product as a birthday present to myself!",1.0
"Amazing product, second time purchasing this. Removes your make up on the first try and is gentle on the skin. Highly recommend.",1.0
"My pores felt tighter and my overall skin was brighter, fresh-looking the next morning. This was gifted to me but I will most definitely repurchase this myself when I use it up. Highly recommended if you have large pores and oily skin.",1.0
"I returned it, as it did nothing for my skin. I really don’t understand what all the hype is about. There was no glow, not really that moisturizing, and my skin looked average in the morning, I guess it just doesn’t work for my skin",0.0

I had high hopes for this mask. I would say my skin didn’t feel any more clean than it does when I wash it with cleanser. Ive tried other activated charcoal masks and this did absolutely nothing to my pores.,0.0
"I like so many others here purchased the mini and was disappointed by the amount of product in the container, only 1/3 full, a comical amount for $24. What is really confusing to me though is looking at the consistency of my product and viewing images of the larger container these appear to be two different creams. The mini is a waxy consistency like a Vaseline and the full size looks like more of a thick whipped butter or cream. Don’t know what’s going on here but I sure don’t like it.",0.0
"I’m honestly shocked at how well this product works for me, as a person with sensitive and mostly dry skin I  decided to try this on a whim. Literally after the first use I was so impressed, it definitely tingled a little bit although not to the point of being uncomfortable but I noticed my skin instantly looked more even and glowy. After a couple of uses my skin definitely felt more smooth and my pores especially on my nose seem far less noticeable. I don’t suffer much with acne so I can’t really say if it helps with that it if you want something to even out your skin tone and give you a glowy look without stripping your skin, this is it. This is definitely become a permanent staple in my regimen! The quickest results I’ve seen in a long time for myself!",1.0
"Ive been using this for almost two years and my acne problem has basically went away. I use this when I get a spot here or there and it goes away almost overnight. I swear by this stuff! I recommend it to everybody. Ive tried everything under the sun, including drugstore, asot, home remedies, etc. and nothing compares to this. One bottle lasted me almost a year. I know a lot of people use a q-tip to apply but I think thats a huge waste as it doesn’t take much. I use a super skinny fine tip paintbrush, with hairs about 1/2 an inch long, as crazy as that sounds, but it works so much better.",1.0

"After hearing so much hype for this product, I decided to switch over from the Herbivore Pink Cloud Cleanser and give it a shot.

Also the texture of the cleansers wasn’t as nice to use.",0.0
"My stars aren’t for the product. It’s good, though you’re likely using nowhere near enough for sun coverage. If you’re using a pea size or even a finger strip, that’s primer, not sunscreen. My two stars are because Trader Joe’s Daily Facial Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF40 has MORE sunscreen and the exact same inert ingredients—save one—in the exact same order. They’re producing it, selling at $9.00, and making a profit. That means that at $36 for this sunscreen we are all absolutely being had by this brand (and so many others). I’m over it. I’m over these brands making a killing off us trying to protect our skin from literal cancer. This isn’t some unique, highly inventive formulation that warrants anything near this price. There is now an exact copy for nearly every single Supergoop sunscreen for a fraction of the price and still we’re given a tag of nearly $40 for most. Forty. No. I’m done. You should be done too.",0.0

I was so excited to try this and it does feel great when i first put it on but after a while of using it my lips are just as dry as before so I don’t know how much this is actually doing. Recommend for a lip balm but would not say this has a lasting impact sadly,0.0
I like that it’s a very small grain exfoliator. It can be good for people trying to begin using physical exfoliators.  I did like that it’s easy to use and doesn’t irritate my skin too much.,1.0
"My skin gets flaky from the dry air/heat in my room so I have to exfoliate often to smooth it out. I have acne so when I exfoliate physically it spreads. A friend told me to try a chemical exfoliant, so she gave me this one and I’m in love. It was very non irritating and every morning I wake up with smooth skin without having to scrub and damage it. I also don’t have to dread repurchasing it because the price is amazing :)",1.0
If you have dry skin this won’t be enough but i think it will be great in the summer. It feels so natural on the skin once rubbed in. It doesn’t sit on my skin or pill and it does well under makeup.,1.0
I’m SO DISAPOINTED. I bought this from the holiday trio pack and was so excited to try it. I don’t have sensitive skin at all and can count one time that my skin hasn’t reacted well with a product. I put this on and immediately my cheeks were red and my skin was burning. I washed it off (which it says on the packaging isn’t necessary- like it’s supposed to be a leave-on mask) and my face is still burning up. I’m so sad.,0.0

I don’t even feel like I have to wear foundation with it. ITS AMAZING. and the fact it’s clean is just the cherry on top! go get this,1.0
"I LOVE this cream for my nighttime routine.  I have combination skin, so this is definitely too heavy to be a daytime cream for me.  However, it definitely keeps your skin nice and moisturized while you’re sleeping.  It had an odd scent to it (or I guess lack of scent), so keep that in mind.  It’s not a bad scent by any means, though.",1.0

In fact, my skin always seemed slightly irritated after using it. Something in the solution did not agree with my epidermis.

I used it for a couple of weeks, but my skin was looking worse and worse. I wish it worked, and maybe for young skin that doesn’t really need anything, it would be ok.

I haven’t noticed much help with the few fine lines but they haven’t gotten any worse with me being out in the sun more this past month. So I can say this essence has helped with keeping my skin healthy and looking fresh. Hasn’t been as dull prior to using this product!!

I truly hope they come out with a bigger jar or pump because this product is truly a holy grail!",1.0

"I received a free sample of this from Influesnter /Sephora/Este Lauder to try and was so excited to use this luxurious facial cream but immediately noticed the overpowering perfume scent which is a total turn off for me. I don’t mind facial products that have a natural or botanical scent but this one is fully perfume and you can even see in their ingredient list that they add “fragrance” which is completely unnecessary for something you put on your face. I liked the silky thick texture of the cream and how it instantly makes your skin feel smooth and moisturized but didn’t notice it having any other of the benefits it claims. It didn’t feel like to fully absorbs into your skin so is not something I would use in the morning because it would effect my makeup wear. One good thing was that I didn’t have any issue using it only sensitive skin, not redness or breakouts which often happens from fragranced products. Overall I liked this but for the price and the fact that I couldn’t stand the smell I would definitely not be buying or recommending it. There are so many great skincare products that cost less and don’t add fragrance and have the same results and I will be sticking to those.",0.0

I am loving this cream. It is very hydrating without being sticky or tacky. The smell is very mild and relaxing not overpowering at all. I see my skin more radiant when I wake up and still moisturized. It had worked well with the eye cream and day cream from the same lotus line. It is pricey but you dont need much to stay hydrated.,1.0

I am a huge fan of this product. I’ve only used this mask a couple of times and I love it! It leaves my face very soft and hydrated the next day. Just a small portion is enough for your whole face. This mask is a lifesaver! Would definitely buy again! (Complimentary from Summer Fridays),1.0

Lately I’ve used it about once a week, but only bc I’m alternating out a lot of intense treatments right now. 3-4 times a week also gave me results without being too thick. So it’s expensive, but it does last a long time! Like a year, at the rate I’m going. Skincare is worth the investment imo!",1.0

It seems to have some kinda of zoning intelligence and what I mean is — it will hydrate my neck to perfection, yet not over moisturize my nose area yet hydrate my cheekbones and not over doe my forehead and chin.

"I liked the product but ended up returning it because I personally didn’t think it was worth the money.

I was very excited to start using this moisturizer especially due to the winter dry skin I’m experiencing.  Unfortunately the heavy smell lingers all day on me and I will not be able to continue to use this product.  I did like the consistency and feel of the moisturizer and did notice my skin felt great all day with only a few small pimples on my chin which I expect when trying anything new on my face . Overall its a great product for anyone seeking great hydration and soft smooth base for makeup but for me I can’t get past the strong fragrance.,0.0
This product was okay. It was nice because I could take off my foundation and eye makeup with the same product all at once! I didn’t feel like it took off my mascara all that well though. It has a pretty strong smell also.,0.0
"I recieved free samples of this from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.This serum is pretty great! I recieved it in sample packets, though, so the method of dispensing would be much easier from a full sized bottle. It smells very fresh and almost floral, but the scent doesn’t stick around for long. You don’t need much at all to cover your entire face and neck. It takes me about a nickle sized amount and I’m completely covered. This serum is pretty thick, and appears to be really greasy on your face at first. Once it absorbs your face gets less shiny, and it doesn’t take long at all. It is so gentle and non-irritating on my skin, and it feels so soft and soothed after I use this. I got 7 days worth of sample packets, and after using for a week I have noticed that my skin texture is softer and my skin tone is more even. I look like I have this really healthy glow. I’m not sure if I’m going to purchase the full size and continue using, but only because I have a skincare routine that works extremely well for me already. I highly recommend giving this a try if you’re thinking about it.",1.0
"Very satisfied with this cleanser. It gives my skin life. And even though I keep it in an area that’s not very warm or cold, every time I apply this on my skin I feel like it cools it down. The consistency is rich and thick and it lathers very well. Never stripping of oils. Grab it! It’s worth it and the hype.",1.0
"This was by far the best complimentary Josie Maran product I received from Influenster! Super thankful, I’ve been eyeing this oil and just like it’s ratings, it is worth it! Not too oily or sticky, at least for my skin. I didn’t see instant results with fine lines (crows feat or smile lines) but I’d continue using this product longer!",1.0
Amazing!!!! Best cleansing balm ever. Seriously melts away makeup so effortlessly. I use a gel cleanser after wards and my skin feels so clean and it truly gets ALL my makeup off. I am obsessed. I bought the small size to try but I will for sure be getting the bigger size next time!! And it has such a nice smell.,1.0

I’ve tried so many products for YEARS that havent been able to keep my lips hydrated after it’s been absorbed. my lips are so dry I cant wear liquid lips without a gloss. I originally got this as a sample and used it 2 nights in a row. the dead skin from my lips literally wiped right off and my lips underneath were soft and super plump!! I wore a liquid lip for the first time in 2 years. i used the entire sample in less than 2 weeks and bought the full size. if you have dry lips with a lot of lines like i do this thing is a miracle in a jar.,1.0
I don’t really get the hype. It does not absorb well into the skin at all. It sort of sits on top in an awkward way. It also leaves my skin really shiny and gross looking afterward. I’ve been using it for 3 days and I am not a fan. I will say that I haven’t seen any bad reactions to using it yet. It’s just really not a good moisturizer at all. Thank goodness I got it as a 500 point reward and that I didn’t waste my money getting a full size.,0.0
"GOOPGLOW 15% Glycolic Acid Overnight Glow Peel is phenomenal! At first, it burned a little on my skin and I was skeptical, but after about 15 minutes it started to feel soothing and clean. I woke up the next morning and my skin already looked 10x better. 10/10 recommend!",1.0
"I LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE this skin cream. I have sensitive dry skin and I haven’t had any reactions to it, it definitely quenches my dehydrated skin and it’s also a really great primer so you kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

"I have finished a couple of bottles of this moisturizer and I am still loving it. Just at the time to get a new one, gifted by Glow Recipe a new bottle of it. I am just too excited.I have combination skin (more towards oily) with adult acne monthly. This is a super lightweight gel-emulsion texture moisturizer it will not giving me a greasy feeling but freshness. It contains malic acid and hyaluronic acid which helps me to gently exfoliate but still leave me lots of moisture. It also contains soothing antioxidant-rich botanicals extract which helps to soothe sensitive skin. I have a high standard of the product when comes to moisturizer that it does help me in oil control for not getting excessive oil after a whole day and still feel moisture. However, it does contain fragrance (less than 0.5% of fragrance), it may irritate sensitive skin. I suggest doing a patch test before applying on the face.  But it just smells too good with the composed of almost 90% real watermelon.It is vegan, cruelty-free, and clean at Sephora that I really love this product more.",1.0
Seriously this is not worth the hype!!! I used it and it did nothing for my skin.. it made my skin feel a bit softer I thought it would exfoliate more it feels similar to the boca face scrub which she probably knocked off,0.0

"I got this as a sample from Influenster and have been using it every day for a week.  I can honestly say that it does smooth out fine lines when you use it before you apply your makeup.  I haven’t been using it long enough to see a huge difference in the permanent lines around my forehead and eye area.  I do follow up with a good moisturizer.  This is great it you are just starting to see fine lines, but if you have full on deep wrinkles, let’s face it, they aren’t going away unless you see a plastic surgeon.  I will more than likely purchase this after my sample is finished just to see what happens after I use it for a couple of months.  To be continued...",1.0

I really like this mask. I have dry skin so this helps when I need a shot of hydration. I love the packaging as it is easy for travel. I like that it melts into the skin instead of it just sitting on top like others. I only wish it did more to exfoliate the skin like it claims. Otherwise it’s a decent product.,1.0

Don’t let this review change your opinion on the rest of their products, as I have tried most of them and have never disappointed!",0.0
I liked this sunscreen but it isn’t one I’d give up my other sunscreen for. It’s very light and doesn’t leave a white tint behind. Has hyaluronic acid in it which is a plus. It’s just not one that mixed well with my skin. I’m not ready for consistent breakouts to see if this would end up working out for me when I have one that already works well. I also received this complimentary from influencer for my honest review.,1.0

"’s very nice and moisturizing. I was expecting it to be good because I know this is a poplar company, I think something I both like and dislike is the very liquid consistency. I like it because it makes it feel lighter but I also don’t love liquid-y products at the same time. Also I think this productive is not affordable for most normal people.

My skin is super sensitive to moisturizers and this one wasn’t horrible but not the best I’ve tried.

It is only after it wears down (20-30 minutes later) that it starts to look like it describes… a pink coral. You can’t see the brightness from my photo but it bright. I recommend the lip balm, but not this particular colour…. unless you’re looking for that 80’s neon lip.",0.0

"I’m torn about this. When I used it every night for about 2 weeks, my skin looked great. It was much more even and moisturized. But this product contains Isopropyl Myristate which is a 5 out of 5 on the comodogenic scale. Meaning I’m 99.99% sure this would clog my pores overtime and cause acne.

"I recently received this product so my scoring is based only on first impression. It’s an eye cream that did not prove itself in the fist few applications, but it better stop up to the plate long term with its ingredients. The packaging though is the worst. I expected a small pump since it’s 15 ml of product. Oh no, it’s a bulky cumbersome item. Good thing we can’t travel anywhere during these times cause the eye cream alone would take more space than a travel shampoo for my long hair. Maybe it’s a fancy air contact protection to prevent the need for preservatives, but I did not see anything about that in the product description when I purchased it. Sorry my disappointment in this silly gimmick packaging has turned into into a venting review.",0.0

I have what I would consider normal or combination skin and live in Southern California with dry but mild winters, so don’t know how it would work for those with dry skin or in a much harsher winter climate. I enjoyed the scent and consistency and while it did a decent job, I was not wowed with any extraordinary results and didn’t experience the hydration I expected so for the price, likely would not repurchase.",0.0

I don’t have bad wrinkles or anything like that but I personally can see where they potentially will start showing. My entire eye area looks AMAZING now, I don’t see any signs of them. I also have dark circles and discoloration (kids, husband and lack of sleep type of issues lol). This makes me look well rested, my discoloration is gone! I have even tried the hyped up Olehenriksen Banana Bright Creme and that didn’t do that much for me, I still had to color correct a bit with yellow concealer to get a bright under eye. This has beat the breaks off that!!! What’s even better is literally ONE pump covers both eyes!!! My little .17fl oz has lasted me almost a month!!! And I still have about half left and I use it every am and pm. I am DEFINITELY taking the plunge and buying a full size when I run out of the smaller one!!!",1.0
Great product awful packaging! I got a trial size of this moisturizer and absolutely loved it so I was excited to buy the large size. The packing stopped working after about 2 weeks and all of the product was trapped inside. Total waste of money.,0.0
"I just recently started using this product after receiving it free as a tester and can not wait to see the results that I get after 6 weeks of use. After only one week I can see a huge improvement in my skin. I have issues with dryness which magnifies my fine lines. This product has already helped so much with the dryness, visibly reducing my fine lines. It does not have a strong smell, goes on so smooth, and sits perfectly under my makeup. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future.",1.0
"i like that it’s gentle and very affordable but honestly it feels awful :/ with other balms you can feel the makeup / residue of the day melting off but with this product it feels like it just mixes with what’s on your face and then stays on your skin no matter how hard you scrub. Definitely only tolerable if you double cleanse because that second product will actually make your skin feel clean, I can’t imagine just using this to cleanse. Cheap is great but sometimes it’s worth it to spend more. I’m using this until my glow recipe papaya sorbet balm arrives",0.0

"I received a small sample of Clinique’s Smart Repair Wrinkle cream as an incentive for my honest opinion. I tried it for 14 straight days and night. I have combination skin and it’s summer (90+, humidity, sunny days). I learned real quick a little goes a long way. It applies super silky. Too much will feel goopy. It will keep your skin moisturized without feeling oily. I can’t honestly say I saw reduced wrinkles or fine lines in the 14 days of use.",0.0
Started off as a beauty on the fly product for me 3 year ago and now it’s an essential. Perfect for removing the hard to get off makeup and doesn’t burn your eyes. Loveeee I have normal skin,1.0
I used the tanning water and then these the next day. The water worked well for me but the drops irrigated my skin amd were way more spotty. They do tan. It’s just not as clean as the water is. Also for my personally the skin irritation is not worth it.. I have showered multiple times to get ride of the drops so my skin can go back to normal. My arms legs stomach and even face and neck have these small bumps. It’s horrible. I used the drops with my lotion and moisturizer. The tan does fade after a few showers. Although I washed my hands they look like oompa orangey. Again this wasn’t until I did the drops. The water didnt have that effect. Maybe it was because I did both. But because of the skin irritation I dont think I’ll use the drops again.,0.0
I like this product if feels good it smells good but holy crap does it dry my skin out. My skin be begging for moisturizer immediately after!!,0.0
I received this product gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I love how moisturized and nourished Honey Halo makes my skin. My skin is on the drier side so this moisturizer works great for me. I will definitely purchase this product on my own. Would recommend!,1.0
"Melts the makeup and sunscreen off my face instantly without any harsh tugging. Some of the reviews complain that this is hard to get off with water and they are right but I don’t think that’s how the product is meant to be used. If you are using this in as the first step in a double cleansing system (follow up with a non balm/oil cleanser), it works like a charm. A little goes a long way. It feels so luxurious and actually motivates me to stick to my routine. This is the most expensive skin care I have ever purchased but it has been worth every penny. By wearing a mask all day, I definitely have been building up more oil than usual and this stuff cuts right through it. If you gently massage it into the skin for several minutes, it can actually bring up some oil plugs too! Thrilled with this purchase.",1.0
"Great face wash, very mild on skin, doesn’t leave my skin dry, washes off easily, great fresh clean scent. A wonderful more affordable similar dupe version of the La Mer cleansing gel",1.0
"I am not sure what “watermelon” smell other reviews are referring to. I actually had Sephora send me a replacement product as I thought the first one I received was rancid. The second product did not smell any better. So, either both products are bad or this simply does not smell like watermelon. I smell cactus water, but NOT watermelon (real or artificial). That said, I am unable to use due to the smell. It smells like the weeds I pull from my garden....that would be the most accurate description I can provide.",0.0
So excited that I finally had the chance to try Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant. The product lathers quite nicely once wet and left my face feeling exfoliated and renewed without being too abrasive. And it’s also travel friendly which I love!I received this product complimentary from dermalogica.,1.0
Love using this twice a week for super soft skin and a way to pamper myself!,1.0
"I love this stuff, it made my skin feel so soft and not so dry!",1.0
"I’ve been using this product for about a month now. Initially I really love the product, it smelled so amazing, the texture was really nice and smooth and creamy. As I started using it for longer periods I noticed that my skin started to break out. I thought maybe it was another product that I was using and so I kept using it. I literally stopped using it to see if it would help bring my breakouts down and it did. This product unfortunately did not work for my skin but hopefully it can work for someone else as everyone’s skin is different. My skin is dry combo,  it’s somewhat sensitive but I’m able to use acids on it like salicylic acid.",0.0
"I’ve been using it for 2 months or so, and am finding it to just not be for me. It’s fine for the undereye area (haven’t had better or worse results), however for the eyelids it makes mine so dry. It doesn’t claim to be hydrating, but was surprised it was causing so much dryness around the eyes. If you have issues with dryness in this area, would avoid.Also, not really a negative, but something that may turn some off: it applies a bit warm. Not super hot/tingly at all, but it is, for me, noticeably warm once it is applied and stays that way for about 5-15 minutes. Potentially for more sensitive people, this may be an issue.For the amount you get, I do think it will last you a long while. I got a sample that was 1/3rd the size of the full size, and I’m still using it ~3 months later with ~2 months of solid use of it. I’d expect the full size to last ~5-6 months, which isn’t all that bad for an eye cream.",0.0
"I thought since Tatcha is such a great, CLEAN company that this lip mask would really do wonders. Well, I prefer my aquaphor lip repair ointment over this. It’s ridiculously overpriced and doesn’t even hydrate my lips. I live in Houston, Texas also and I have very dry lips, just to give a little background for this review. Not worth purchasing. Save your money.",0.0
"What an amazing cream! I received this complimentary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for my honest review. The way this feels on your skin is what I imagine heaven to be like. It is the smoothest cream and it soaks into your skin beautifully! I noticed a difference in my face after the first use. It is pricey, but worth every penny and I will definitely be purchasing after it is gone.",1.0
"I had high expectations from these because I love the Peace our brand, but it didn’t feel like these pore strips did much. They did a great job at staying on and were comfortable. They left temporary red marks in the AM, so leave yourself some time. Positives were that they were neither harsh, irritating, nor drying. Negatives were that I just wasn’t sure they did anything. I’ve done three rounds, spaced a week between. Every time I removed the strips I expect smoother skin or smaller pores, and I just don’t notice anything. Perhaps if I had a microscope I’d notice a difference. I’d rather put they money towards a facial or a peel. Can’t say I’d recommend these to anyone.",0.0
"[I received a sample for this review.] I have been using this in morning for over about a month. The caffeine gives me a tingling feeling but I did not see any results.

"Broke me out really bad, especially around my eyes. They leave an oily residue which is really unpleasant.",0.0
Overall liked this product. This was my first time using a product that had such a high acid content so I very gradually introduced it into my routine. I would feel a small tingling sensation when I applied the product but otherwise I had no sensitivity to the product or skin breakouts. Although I didn’t see any negative effects to the product it was difficult for me to see any real changes to my skin after using the product for a month once a week. I have increased my frequency to twice weekly so I would like to continue to use it to see how it my improve my skin.,0.0

"The hydra Zen moisturizer is so good for my dry winter skin! I tend to have oily skin and can sometimes be breakout prone when testing a new productS, but this had no ill side effects. I like the way the product smells and feels. It doesn’t feel heavy and absorbs quickly, both things are important to me because I am often rushed when I’m getting ready. I would recommend this product to anybody who wants to have moisturized skin in all seasons",1.0
I got a sample of this from Sephora and used it for the first time today. I was really hoping it would help my peeling skin from Tretinoin because it felt amazing going on. After about 20 minutes my skin started to feel a little itchy in a couple spots and when I looked in the mirror I saw my a few red blotchy spots on my face and neck. Apparently it’s happened to other people as well according to the reviews. Sad. :(,0.0

I received this for free from Influenster  in exchange for my honest review. I like this product. The scent is light. It does improve my combination skin texture. I didn’t have luck wearing it under makeup but I’m completely aware that could be my foundation.

"I have mixed feelings about this product. More often than not it does flake and/or up. I’ve tried various methods of application: a little, a lot, soon after moisturizer, waiting a long time after moisturizer and there’s no consistency in how it ends up. There have been times when it works perfectly and looks amazing all by itself, but I try to recreate the application method and again it’s flaky and honestly a little gross looking. Trying to correct the flakiness makes it worse. For the price I’d expect top notch quality every time I use the product. The search continues.",0.0
Smells amazing and a little bit got all of my make up off! I used wipes up until now and never realized how dry and tight my skin was. I’ll never go back!,1.0

"Overall a good product, although not crazy about the price point. That said, a little bit goes not a long way but not a short way. I use this as a night oil because it is a bit greasy, which I don’t want to suppress with powder or other makeup (like I would during the daytime). I like to let it sit on the surface and take as long as it needs to soak in (e.g. while I’m sleeping). When I wake up in the morning, my skin is just a little greasy from this, but I like to think that means it did something. I also don’t mind because I wash my face first thing after waking up, so no harm no foul there.",0.0
"Thanks @butterly , @chickadvisor and @clarins for choosing me to try Clarins Double serumI find the product to be of good quality that combines two forces that work together on improving my skin .

"Ohhhh man how I wishedd this mask Would have worked fir me and been my new go to.  Unfortunately this was not the case for. Everything about this mask is beautiful. The texture, the smell, the ease of use and the packaging to protect all those great ingredients. As said before I have extremely sensitive skin and a couple of ingredients in this mask (for example fragrance is pretty high up there) among other fragrant oils or irritating ingredients can really screw up my skin. I have to be very careful when using masks containing acids. This product felt beautiful going on but soon after my face really started to tingle. I stuck with it but I probably should have taken it off sooner! My skin was soooooo red and irritated. On a more positive note I sud look more glowy and even but it’s just not worth the risk if damage to my skin for me. So sad as I really wanted this to work for me!!! But I will be passing it along to someone who doesn’t have such sensitive skin I have a feeling they will love it!! Thank you soooooooo much Influenster for sending me this complimentary product to test out!!",0.0

"I’m so glad I tried a sample before I purchased. All the reviews make it seem like it’s a miracle serum, and maybe it is for dry skin, but not for my oily skin. I thought it’d be greasy but surprisingly, it’s not - it goes on greasy and then dries very very quickly (is it the alcohol?). I like the smell though. I put it on my face and the next day, woke up with a giant pimple on my chin. I thought, maybe it’s just my skin acting up (I don’t get pimples very often), so I waited a few days, and tried it again. This time, a weird bump on my cheek, sort of like a simple. I didn’t change any other thing in my skincare routine except for this oil. Bummer.",0.0

"I don’t like this. I have fair skin and the tint to this is too dark and I end up looking orange. This doesn’t sit well on top of the Supergoop spf40 moisturizer, I get pilling and it doesn’t really set in. I’m able to touch my face and it comes off easily. I don’t like the texture, it feels like a physical sunscreen. I usually use the Supergoop Unseen sunscreen so I decided to try this for the glow. If it wasn’t tinted I think I’d like this formula because the glow is nice in natural lighting.",0.0
"I really wanted to like this but I couldn’t. Firstly I hate the jar packaging as it degrades the active ingredients everytime it’s opened. Secondly the silicones, while they feel nice application wise, just sat on top of my skin and broke me out. My combination skin didn’t feel moisturized or hydrated at all. For such an expensive brand you’d think they could come up with more than just cheap fillers which trick you into thinking your skin feels like silk.",0.0
"I still use this, but only about once a week, because it is too strong for my sensitive pale skin.  It does help exfoliate, but stays quite red for a day or two afterwards and I need to use vey soothing products for a few days afterwards.  Probably would work well for normal non sensitive skin",1.0
"This review is based off a 7-day free sample from Influenster and Clarins.Clarins Double Serum claims to visibly firm, smooth, and boot radiance with 21 potent plant extracts. It’s definitely potent in scent, which I don’t really care for, but it seems to fade fairly quickly. The serum is very oily going on, but it absorbs into my skin and looks and feels good. Honestly, I probably wouldn’t purchase at full price. It’s more than I’m currently willing to spend on skincare and I don’t care for the scent.",0.0
J’adore ce masque pour les lèvres de LANEIGE. Je l’utilise matin et soir car il rend définitivement mes lèvres super douces. La senteur est divine et me rappelle la gomme balloune aux fraises Yummy!

I received this product to try and am absolutely in love with it. I like the texture of the cream and how my skin doesn’t feel greasy which i was nervous with since my skin can be oily looking after using it can barely tell I used something under my moisturizer.

"Honestly I expected a lot more from this product with all the reviews I read and the recommendations I got from friends. Personally I didn’t think it approved my skins appearance at all. I maybe did notice a glow for the first few days but after that it didn’t really offer much. Not to mention I HATED the smell of it. I later found out it had licorice in it which I absolutely can’t stand. I really really wanted this product to be better but with its insane price tag I had to return it. I’ve always struggled with finding moisturizers to help my skin, especially since I live in an extremely dry climate. I just found absolutely no it factor for the good genes to justify the cost of it.",0.0
This scrub is amazing! I use it once a week and let me tell you- immediate satisfaction every time! I love how the scrub turns into little clumps because it’s removing your dead skin cells! So crazy. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and clean afterwards. Perfect for prepping your skin before applying serums and moisturizers. I deducted a star from the rating because I’m not in love with the smell of the scrub. It smells artificial and synthetic. I don’t know how though since it has the “Clean At Sephora“ seal but it just does.,1.0

It’s okay. It moisturizes my skin but I think I have deeply dry skin so it can only do so much for me. I think it’s worth the price and I’d buy it again. I need to combine it with a heavier moisturizer to fit my needs.,1.0
This truly does everything it states to do! I’ve been using this in the mornings and I love it! I bought it because of the smell and I love anything that smells like this.

I’ve been pairing this with the moisturizer and it definitely leaves your skin feeling clean and awake! I will buy it again and again.,1.0

I have been using this physical exfoliant for years and it has been the most effective yet does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I like the powder aspect as it allows me to customize the grittiness of the actual mixture that gets used.

This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling but I have purchased the full size on my own multiple times.,1.0

I usually don’t spend a lot of money on balms because I just never thought it was necessary. I thought all balms didn’t work and it was just a money ploy to make you reapply constantly and run out quick. I tried this and this seriously does work.

"I recieved this product for free from Bzzagent. I used this moisturizer for 2 weeks consistently, but havent really noticed any anti-aging like the product claims. No real noticeable difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. This moisturizer is very thick consistency, I personally prefer a thinner, gel-like consistency for my oily skin. I feel like this would be great to use in the colder, winter months. The thing I didnt like is the strong smell, it is very heavily scented, so beware if you have sensitive skin.",1.0

"I have super dry skin, so I only use this cleanser after exercising when I feel the need for a deep clean. And it’s ideal for that. It doesn’t strip my skin, but it goes get it clean. It smells like ginger candy, which is really pleasant. I don’t think it’s very good for exfoliating — the loofah bits are gigantic. Overall I prefer chemical exfoliants. I took off a star for the packing which I hate. It would be much better off in a pump. Having to squeeze the bottle gives you no control and a ton of it comes out, but you only need a little. It’s wasteful and at this price point, that’s an issue.",1.0

The creme itself feels thick and luxurious. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. Everyday my skin feels softer and firmer. But the scent. It has to go. It smells like a cheap Avon product.

"It’s nothing special. It does take some of your makeup off, but not all. It didn’t emulsify well with water and it didn’t rinse well either. I found the bamboo particles difficult to rinse and abrasive. I gave 2 stars for the ingredients and the fact that it’s not irritating (without the powder), but execution is not good.",0.0

This product felt nice and rejuvenating when applied to my skin but I didn’t notice any difference after using it for a few weeks.,0.0
"I like the texture of this product. It literally feels like you’re exfoliating. Because of that, you really want to make sure you follow up with a moisturizer. I’ve found whenever I use this my chin area and around my mouth become super dry almost rash like if I don’t follow up with an intense moisturizer.",1.0
"The smell was not very nice, it smelt like sunscreen, which some like but I deeply dislike. It also did not feel as gentle as I would hope.",0.0
"The most glowy and dewy sunscreen!! I definitely didn’t get the right shade- it’s just a touch dark for me but I blend it out a bunch and it looks super natural! Doesn’t burn my eyes, has great sun protection and doesn’t pill!",1.0
"I had the chance to try this product: #freeproduct #trywithtopbox.Over the years, I am more and more aware of the marks left by time on my skin. The wrinkles and marks of expression sink into my flesh and never leave it. So I was curious to see the effects of this product! On first test the cream is soft and leaves a comfortable and pleasant effect on the skin. I tried it for a short period of time (Small sample), so the results are not convincing enough for me. Impossible to see a real difference in the short term. If you do not have the patience to observe a result, this product will certainly not be for you. However, this cream is easy to apply on a daily basis and fits easily into your routine!",0.0
"I’ve been using this stuff for six months or so. I always put a moisturizer on my lips before bed, so when I saw this was designed to have additional benefits, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately, I didn’t notice any changes or improvements in my lips. My lips still get dry during the day. There are still some fine lines. They’re no plumper or softer than before. On the plus side, the jar lasts forever. It has a nice texture and taste.",0.0
Love this stuff so much. I received a sample and as soon as I run out I’m buying the full size. It takes my makeup off and still cleanses my face so it’s a win-win. I have dry skin and this doesn’t irritate my face and makes it smooth and hydrated.,1.0
"The tatcha products have been really great for my skin, the product has really reduced the size of my pores and the fine lines that I have. I would really recommend to try them out!",1.0
My oily/combo skin loves this. It’s the only oil that doesn’t make me look like a grease ball and absorbs so well into my skin. It makes my skin so hydrated. It works great if you mix it with their Glycolic Night Serum!,1.0
I am completely impressed with this bareMinerals Skinlongevity product! I am a vegan with a newly discovered gluten allergy and it’s been a challenge to find products that feel natural and “clean”. This serum has noticeably improved the texture of my skin and has added the perfect amount of moisture. I love this serum! I will be buying it again.,1.0
"I’m not really sure if this is making any difference in my skin, it honestly looks the same since I’ve been using it. Feels like I’m just putting water on my face before a moisturizer, not worth the price in my opinion.",0.0
"I was so excited when I received this in my Sephora Playbox.  Especially since it has soft and good for sensitive skin.  I followed the directions and applied it after cleansing.  I am a Black woman.  I put it on my face and I looked like a ghost!  It was hard to work into my face and not moisturizing.  It made my face feel dry and I looked ashy.  Even after I buffed in my face powder, I couldn’t get rid of the ghost like white on my face.   I’m glad I didn’t purchase this!  Women of color do not buy!",0.0
Honestly I didn’t really love this product. It was just like any other lip balm that I’ve tried. My lips feel even more dry than they were before and are beginning to champ. But the packaging and the taste is good.,0.0
It was very disappointing! I waited till I finish the bottle to give a review and I did not see any noticeable change.  I was expecting a little bit more.  It had such a good review but I guess it didn’t work for me.,0.0
I didn’t notice much of a difference in the size of the pimple after leaving on all night.,0.0
"WOW. Color me impressed. I was gifted a sample of this stuff as a birthday reward through Sephora along with a mini pot of the moisturizer. I’ve only used the cleanser twice now, but tonight I was shook. I normally use my Face Halos to take off my makeup, and they do a great job. Tonight I paired it with the DE cleanser and I could not believe it... this stuff works SO well at removing makeup that it was turning my Face Halo back to white! I even put a small amount straight on one of the Face Halos that was really saturated with makeup and it cut right through it. !!! Incredible.",1.0
"I have a mixed skin, but during winter I’m mostly dry. This moisturizer has a nice texture and a wonderful hygienic packaging, but when i put a small amount on my skin (less that a pump) it never sinks in, always stays on top of my skin. So my skin is dehidrated and feels tight and the moisturizer leave my skin greasy. Definitely not for me!",0.0
This has such a light weight texture. It wears perfectly under makeup and is great for everyday use. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future as my daily sunscreen. It’s thin and glides on easily. Be sure to shake it before using. I don’t have super sensitive skin but “daily use” sunscreens clog my pores but this one doesn’t.,1.0
"Not too sure about this mask. It says mask but i feel like its more a moisturizer that doesn’t moisturize the skin? I don’t get the point of this mask. I thought it was a mask that we have to peel. But its not. You leave it on your face, but it gets sticky on my face. So i don’t know :/",0.0
It cleans my face well. But smells like baby vomit. I won’t buy this again. I love their products and have used many of them over the years. This is just not one for me,0.0
Great daily moisturizer! Absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and fresh. A little goes a long way!,1.0
"I enjoy this serum, and it smooths VERY WELL around the face. But I do feel like it is simply on par with other hydrating serums. I like it best mixed with other products. So imho, a little pricy.",1.0
"I wanted to love this so much, I had faith I bought $160 worth of skincare from Dr. Jart. All the descriptions were perfect for my sensitive, acne prone, and very dry (new york winters) skin. But after a week of use, my skin was still dry and flakey, I broke out, and also when I would first initially apply the product it burned and irritated my skin so much but I believed in it so much I looked past that. After I noticed my skin started to get worse I knew I had to stop. I saw a video of a dermatologist saying not to use these products because they are filled with essential oils, which may work for some people but for others they are no good. I am so sad:( I don’t understand why put fragrance or essential oils in products that are branded for sensitive skin if there’s a chance there will be a negative reaction :( With that being said, everyone’s skin is different and this couple very well work for someone else but for my dry and sensitive skin it failed me.",0.0
"I love the way this sunscreen feels and it has such a beautiful glow but it pilled like CRAZY. I had so many pilling pieces on my skin, especially in the forehead and temple area. It was so unpleasant every time I touched my face to see and feel pilled skincare so I returned it. There are much better sunscreens on the market.",0.0
"I have pretty sensitive skin, and I get really red on my nose and cheeks, as well as some acne here and there. I was looking for a skincare product that would help reduce my redness and correct my acne, and boy did I find it. I use my fingertips and pat this onto my skin where I’m red or have blemishes and it makes a huge difference. It evens out my skin really nicely, and I don’t ever have issues layering makeup on top of it, although sometimes it isn’t necessary. Sometimes I just wear this for those no makeup days to even out my skin tone a bit.  The only issue I’ve ever had is that if I don’t moisturize really well before I use this, it can cling to my dry patches and not look so flattering. Other than that, I love this stuff!",1.0
"I initially got this as a free sample and I’m so impressed with how it made my skin look and feel the morning after! I was so shocked that upon first application or using this, got an instant result already. It totally refined my skin, made my skin extra smooth and soft,  shrinks my pores and brighten my skin as well. My face was glowing! This is the first face treatment serum that gave me multiple benefits in 1 night! I am not joking. This is the first serum that really shrinked my pores and refined my skin that well, satisfied me and gave me the benefits i wanted with my skin! Just a warning for first time users to  apply thin layer on your face avoiding the eyes and mouth area because this will cause a mild tingling effect ( proof that it’s working on your pores) but will also go away in a few seconds. Just use this 2-3x a week. I know it’s on the pricey side but it’s so worth it!",1.0
"Probably one of the BEST face washes I’ve ever used, I have very dry and sensitive skin, I breakout really easily if something irritates my skin but after trying the Soy Face Cleanser, my skin literally glows, it doesn’t strip my skin of its natural moistures so it doesn’t dry it out. I seriously recommend this product. (I always wait for the limited edition versions to come out because they last the longest)",1.0
This is a gentle but effective AHA/BHA mask that is all natural. I used it without the oil afterwards but I found it really is effective. There is a slight tingling when you put it on but it doesn’t irritate the skin at all.,1.0
"I really had high hopes for this product and I was severely disappointed. First off I have a tan right now and when I put this on, I looked GHOSTLY pale. Which wasn’t necessary an issue for me, as I was putting foundation on. However, even after I had fully blended this product in and left it on to let it dry down and applied my foundation, it made my foundation not look nearly as good as it normally does and I also felt like you could see even more redness than usual. I was sent this product complimentary, and it is just not for me",0.0
"I used this entire bottle as directed daily and I saw no difference in my skin. I’ve used much less expensive Vitamin C serums and I thought the AHA would really step it up from others but I’m sad to say it did not. I wish I had spent my birthday gift card on something else. However, the bottle is very pretty so I do like to keep it in my medicine cabinet for the look!",0.0

"Meh. Not horrible, but not great. Very little to barely enough foam or makeup removal capabilities. It be okay for notmal to mildly sensitive skin. I like a more tingly, medium foam action, with little to no scent. Save your money and skip it because I still felt residue from the day after use. *free trial *received complimentary product.",0.0
"THIS PRODUCT DESTROYED MY SKIN. I received this as part of my Sephora birthday gift and was so excited. It literally ruined my life. I have NEVER had acne before, only a few spots here and there. The instant I started using this, I got the worst break out of my life and have not been able to get rid of it ever since. I want to cry every day that I wake up and see how red and awful my skin is. Do yourself a favor and DONT USE THIS. I wish I could go back in time and throw it out even faster than I did.",0.0
"I bought this with really high hopes, but I was a little let down. It smells great and doesn’t leave my skin really tight after, like most face washes do, but that is about it. My skin does not feel thoroughly cleansed and I have been breaking out the past few months which was not the case prior to purchasing this.",0.0
"I really tried to love this product, despite it stinging my face and breaking me out. When applied as a moisturizer, it made me shiny (not to be confused with cousin dewy) and broke me out. When applied as a primer, it felt like me makeup was melting off and clogging my pores. When applied as an eye mask, I feel like it actually dehydrated my eyes, making my lines more prominent. I had to take a break from it to let my acne subside. As a last resort, I applied as an overnight mask and woke up to an oily face, with product peeling off as soon as I touched it. I really wish it worked for me, I really wanted this to be my 3 in 1 miracle product, but sadly tis not.",0.0
"This is actually a very nice lip balm. It plumped my lips a little, definitely did decrease lines a bit and had no scent, which I love. BUT. It lasted maybe 20 uses. It was like a sample. I was starting to hit plastic by day 3. I’ll admit I use a lot of lip balm before bed, but not that much! I’d buy this over and over if it were $5 or there was more in the tube. But DE also charges $72 for virgin marula oil; I just got some from Whole Foods for $8-$9.",0.0

"I have oily skin and this is best for dry skin, so my review is from that lens. This cream feels rich, which is a good thing. I wake up with an extremely oily face. It feels like a little product absorbed into my skin overnight but most of it just sat on top. It does hydrate my skin in dry winter air. I didn’t notice other improvements to my skin. I used it almost every night for about 3.5 weeks. It came in Sephora’s Favorites Skincare’s Next Big Thing box.",0.0
I really didn’t know what to expect because it felt so light but it was very moisturizing. The packaging is beautiful and the spatula is integrated perfectly on the container. I have noticed a difference with my skin and the more I use it the more it glows. I recommended this product to anyone with dry skin that doesn’t like heavy products!,1.0

"I have normal to dry skin, I can get flaky on my nose and forehead and I thought the lotion would be okay since I know the gel absorbs quicker and I wanted to use this at night. when I put this moisturizer on it felt super heavy and wouldn’t absorb quick at all especially where I have larger pores they would feel clogged. but if you’re someone who has severely dry skin I think this would be great for you, it’s just not for someone who has more normal skin than dry.",0.0

"I definitely gave this product a chance.  I used an entire bottle in addition to the concentrated brightening essence and renewal night cream.

This is my first time trying anything from Glow Recipe and I have to say I am impressed.  I like that it comes in a plum shaped container. It’s so cute. The product itself comes in a separate pod that you pop Into the container.  This texture feels like a bouncy Watery gel. It applies very smoothly. I leally like the way it feels after it has absorbed.,1.0
I feel like a broken record here. I dont recommend this for sensitive acne prone skin. Bought this because another product (Watermelon Glow moisterizer) was giving me breakouts and this also caused some breakouts to occur along my jawline. I had JUST gotten my skin under control. Not recommended for sensitive skin.,0.0

"I love the smell of rose, and this toner has the perfect rose scent. Not perfumey or overpowering, but very light and natural. The packaging is great and looks pretty on my bathroom counter. The rose petals in the bottle are a nice touch and make it extra luxe. The product itself works great and is very hydrating on my uber dry winter skin. I still need to follow up with a moisturizer, but this helps to add extra hydration. The price is steep but worth it for a ‘treat yourself’ skincare product.",1.0
"I bought this because its concentrated size is better for travel, but compared to the tanning water, it just doesn’t get the job done. I used a TON of drops, and I wasn’t nearly as dark as when I just used the tanning water. Buy the tanning water spray instead!!",0.0

"I recently figured out that I had perioral dermatitis that was causing cracked, red and itchy skin around my mouth and nose. Not only is it uncomfortable and looks terrible it also made makeup application a frustration. I needed to find something that would be gentle on my skin, remove my makeup and not make the dermatitis worse. I discovered this gem and will not be going back. It’s easy to use and very gentle on my skin. It effortlessly takes off all my makeup, including mascara. And the best part is that my skin issues have improved substantially since I started using it.",1.0

"Honestly, it does smell bad I’m not gonna lie. HOWEVER I have struggled with acne all my life (I’m now 26) and this stuff really works at preventing breakouts. My usual problem is that I have so many breakouts that by the time a few of them heal and go away I have about 3 more. This product actually helped prevent it and as a result my skin is clearer than ever. I use once a day before bed after Sunday’s  Saturn toner. Important to note that I don’t think this should be used for treatment but rather prevention. And if you use more than once a day I noticed that it sort of clogged pores on my nose.

In purchased this in a moment of “I need to do better for the environment and buy my skin care in glass containers“. It’s an ok moisturizer. I have very dry skin and this wasn’t enough for me.

"This is a fine lip balm, not the best. The formula is nice when you first apply, not too sticky or heavily fragranced. The part that falls flat for me is the lasting power, it has to be reapplied much more often than my other lip balms. It’s nice for variety, but I’ve ended up just putting some of the lip sleeping mask on in the morning and it lasts so much longer- please just put it in a tube so I can carry it around better!!",0.0
I really like this light face cream. It is not sticky or oily it’s great to put on sick at night and when it is used with the belief lip night mask it works beautifully together. It really does give you that highlighting glow as you can see in my photo of course after a while it seeps in but it leaves you feeling fully hydrated. I’d like to put this on before I go outside in the sun on a really hot day or on a windy day to protect my face and skin.,1.0

I bought this because of all the great reviews and was super excited for it to come but when I tried it it ruined my face!

I’m a huge fan of OleHenriksen products and use their face wash already. In my thirties I started noticing slight pigmentation and loss of brightness. I’ve been trying everything under the sun to help me improve and regain some of that youthful glow. Vitamin C has shown to have major benefits in that arena. I’ve tried the product for 2 weeks now and have noticed that the formula is light weight and moisturizing. It has not brightened by skin noticeably however it is in better shape than it was 2 weeks ago.  My husband commented on the glow and he rarely notices anything! That in itself speaks volumes :),1.0
I loved the sample but the fragrance dried my skin when I bought the full size.,0.0
AHHH I love this stuff. I just got it and have only used it twice BUT its amazing. I live in Colorado and we have no moisture in the air and my skin gets really dry and it seems like nothing works without reapplication throughout the day.

I’ve stopped using it consistently the last month or so and there’s been no change that I’ve noticed in my skin, no “oh shhh I need to order more now my skin looks horrible without it!” Moments, not yet anyway.

Gifted by Fresh. Great product. Sugar plum is a great color- its sheer with just the right amount of pigment and can be lighter or darker depending on how many coats you apply. It is very moisturizing and it’s basically an amazing lip balm with added SPF which I personally love.,1.0
I’m 8.5 mos pregnant and all of a sudden my skin is super dry. Tried the sample and fell in love with how this moisturizer feels. It is definitely soft and cloudy on the skin. I don’t know how to describe it really but this moisturizer is wonderful. I have my husband using it too now. Teehee.,1.0
My skin suddenly went from oily to dry and I started using this based on a recommendation.

The glow is beautiful. It is hydrating, yet not irritating and it enhances your natural skin. I was skeptical about buying this since I’m already a bronze beauty..this just took me to the next level. I have sensitive skin, like if you look at me wrong, a pimple says hi. No breakouts..I’m in love.",1.0
"This mask has a really strange consistency it’s thick and sticky almost like glue, strangely it smells like glue too. I don’t feel like this puts any moisture into my skin but it might create a moisture barrier to prevent losing moisture in dry circulating air so the name is appropriate",0.0
Got some as a sample when I ordered online and instantly liked it. Got the smaller version today and plan to replace it with my other cleanser. It makes my face feel so soft after!,1.0
I initially loved this product as it left my skin perfectly glowy. I quickly realized though that it would also cause a breakout every time I used it which was unfortunate. My skin is a bit sensitive so maybe others would have better luck.,1.0
The second I used this product I fell in love! It is the most amazing brightening serum I have ever used! It leaves my skin feeling soft and its amazingly shiny and I love how refreshing it feels!!,1.0
These are ok not amazing probably wouldnt by again,0.0
"I was actually a little nervous to try this - even though there are so many good reviews, I had been using a niacinamide serum that I loved, but was pricey. Switching to this, it definitely lives up to the hype!! This gives a great glow, had a nice gel like consistency, goes on smooth, and really helps regulate my oily forehead (combo skin here). I use it before my differin as a buffer and have no complaints.",1.0
"I’ve been using the C-Firma serum mixed with the B Hydra gel, along with Umbra Sheer physical defense SPF 30 and the Shaba Complex eye serum. I have sensitive skin that is very prone to flushing and redness, and these never caused any irritation. I love that this is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical sunscreen. I wear contacts, and this sunscreen never irritated my eyes. However, it was a little oily for my taste, so I will probably stick with other brands. It is a huge bottle for a facial sunscreen, so a pretty good value.",0.0
Farmacy gifted me this new gel mask I am super excited about this product. During the warm months in the south I love all gel texture products from moisturizers to masks. This product is light and full of powerful ingredients.,1.0
I got the chance to review this product  free complimentary from dermalogica ! I really like it! It’s a good consistency. Goes on smoothly. Exfoliates well but isn’t rough on the skin. I’d definitely recommend this product. Its definitely high quality.,1.0
"I have sensitive skin so I decided to try this product. I had no idea that I had eczema until last Summer when I started using this product and it caused flare ups on my cheeks and nose area. I got small red bumps which were bumpy and itchy. After trying multiple tropical creams recommended by my doctor, I was able to get rid of it. Well, it took me 6 months to heal. For some reason, I always thought it could be the face mask that might’ve the skin irritation. So, I took another chance and tried it again. I’ve used it for a week and it triggered my eczema again and I’m back at using tropical creams. If you have dry sensitive skin, please don’t take a chance.If you’re suffering from the same problem, ask your doctor to recommend you “Protopic 0.1%” as it helps with eczema. Also, I’ve been using Keihl’s ultra hydrating cream everyday for almost a year to moisture my skin.",0.0
"I am already a big fan of Estee Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair Serum, so I was very excited to receive this eye cream in exchange for an honest review. It has a silky gel consistency that is not at all greasy, very similar to the serum. It’s perfect for night time for deep overnight hydration. I wake up looking less tired and my under eye area looks plumper. Wrinkles also become less visible with continued use. Really wonderful product.",1.0
"Huge fan of this brand, and these few drops don’t disappoint. I use it as part of my morning ritual because the drops leave me feeling refreshed, skin looking moisturized and dewy, and the smell is fantastic",1.0
I received this product free to try from Influenster and I must say it is amazing! My skin feels brand new after using it one time. This is a product I will definitely keep purchasing.,1.0
"I bought the mini size just to try it out. This is probably the best moisturizer I’ve used for my face! Doesn’t make me breakout and leaves my face so smooth and hydrated. Definitely will re purchase. You don’t need a lot, little goes along way.",1.0
"I received a few samples of this wash and immediately was shocked by the texture.  I opened it thinking there would be a liquid and a powder popped out and went everywhere,  lol. I washed my face with it and all I could think was that this feels and smells like they took a bar of ivory soap and turned it into a powder. My face feels tight and my hands feel like squeaky clean and super dry. I do not like this at all. I received this sample complimentary from dermalogica",0.0
"As I got older I found that I had major skin problems. I was dealing with it being super oily in some areas causing break out, and super dry to the point of skin flaking off and peeling in others. I tried a lot of anti aging products only to find out I am allergic to most of them, primarily retinol which leaves me covered in hives and huge red blotches. I had been trying to find something that worked well all over as opposed to using several different products over different areas of my face. When I first got this sample in one of my beauty subscriptions and was hesitant to put an OIL on my skin. It just seemed too risky. I finally decided to try it when everything else I had tried kept failing. I started with a clean slate. I hadn’t used any products on my face for a full week before starting, and OMG! It was incredible. My face evened out, the dry patches were gone, the oily patches were gone, I had no more breakouts, it even seemed to reduce the rosacea that I’ve had since I was a child. I recently ran out and thought I would hold off for a bit on getting another one because the price is kind of steep, but sure enough after being out of it for 2 weeks all the old problems came back. I don’t care, it’s worth it.",1.0
"i received a small foil sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream to try and give my honest opinion. i can tell you it’s fragrance free, and absorps quickly but obviously I didn’t see any difference with one use. all the results are from using after 4 weeks and claims are it helps with everything- dark circkles, puffiness, wrinkles etc.  it uses their CL1870 Peptide Complex™ to achieve this. One use of the cream is just not enough time to tell how well it works. #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox",0.0
this cream was just ok. i didn’t see much of a difference in my skin and my skin still felt tight and dry after using it. also you don’t get much for the price.,0.0

"The Sunday Riley C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum has a super lightweight lotion texture and subtle, citrus scent. It helps to address fine lines and hyperpigmentation for a more radiant complexion. It is a gentle and non-irritating formula. The formula is shelf stable and does not oxidize. I love the pump dispenser as well.",1.0
this product was gifted to me but it truly is amazing i would suggest it to anyone it makes ur skin feel so clean smooth and nice it’s a great gentle exfoliant and leaves my skin so clean and clear!!!,1.0
"This cleanser is amazing! Very moisturizing for my dry skin. Also doesn’t safe for sensitive skin. Easily takes off makeup, even mascara!",1.0
I was really disappointed because I love innisfree products. But this left a crazy white case in addition to being really difficult to blend!!,0.0
I wanted to love it but it didn’t work out for me. I have rosy cheeks and this didn’t work for me at all. You could still see my redness throughout the day. I did like that it was light weight and has spf in it though!,0.0
"Be careful of the reviews on Sunday Riley, as the FTC just found that the CEO and employees have been leaving fake reviews. Anyway, I purchased and used up the half ounce bottle. It was moisturizing and I actually grew to like the smell, but I did not see a difference in my skin.",0.0
It’s an OK serum with 20% vitamin C and 10% 8HA. It’s OK I don’t think my skin likes Tacha though,0.0
"First off I got this product to try for a limited time, to then submit my findings.....it’s a milky colored water with a subtle smell, if not any at all. I have been using this religiously, in place of my toner after washing, and my skin HAS gotten better, honestly. Less irritated and red, dark spots not as noticeable and really the biggest thing, is my skin is just smoother and looks more youthful (like not as dry).Voxbox hooked me up on this and I will be buying this next time, as I’ve seen a huge improvement in my, rather normally dull, skin.",1.0
"I received this free from Influenster to try. I liked the soft and creamy texture of this product. I have sensitive and combination oily/dry skin and this was the perfect balance for me. Now lately it is really humid in the south, and I notice my skin getting slightly oilier but that’s only of I’m outside for an excessive amount of time. The cream smells good and is light weight but doesn’t tingle as much as other charcoal products I’ve used, such as the face wash.  I’m giving it 5 stars because it was soft and hydrating which I need. I don’t have much facial acne but if I was rating this for acne, it would get 1 star. I have a few tiny tiny blemishes due to heat, humidity and excessive sweating. This has not helped clear them at all!!! If you have a lot of acne, I don’t think it’ll work. But for hydration and a light weight formula, this is really good!!",1.0
"very moisturizing if you use a TON of product, but takes a lot to moisturize! it smells good but there are better moisturizers out there.",0.0
"It’s a very lightweight, gel like consistency moisturizer. It sinks into the sling very nicely, but the skins feels soft and moisturizer. I like using this in conjunction with the water essence, as a seal, once I apply the essence. They work nicely together, especially if you have an oily or combination skin. It’s just enough hydration, without the heaviness of a moisturizer",1.0
Dr. Dennis Gross’s Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel is fantastic! I could see and feel a difference in my skin. The overall tone and texture has improved. It works wonders!,1.0
I didn’t see any difference with this cleanser and it did not fully remove my makeup as other cleansers have done in the past. I’ve also noticed it burns my eyes if I put it near them when I’m washing my face so I will not be purchasing again.,0.0
"Unfortunately, this did not do much for my skin. My face felt clean immediately after using but I could not see any difference in my pores after continued use. It may be better for people with sensitive skin compared to something like the GlamGlow but for me it didn’t do enough.",0.0
"I really want to love this.. but it’s so light/green, it doesn’t match with my tan skin, I tried like 3 times but.. just no! I have to give it to my mom bc of her skin tone, but it was so greasy too. I Just don’t like it and I don’t recommend this stuff.",0.0
This is by far the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. It’s like it’s not on my face. It’s almost so suspiciously amazing that I question whether it’s truly working. Like someone look into this because there’s no way sunscreen can feel like this & actually work. Just buy it.,1.0
Doesn’t do much for pores at all. Smells nice though,0.0
"I received a sample of this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling  in exchange for my honest review. I thought it was interesting that it comes in powder form, but it was easy to create a paste when mixed with water in my hands. I did find the physical exfoliant to be a little grittier and harsh than I like, but I did feel like it helped improve my skin texture. Although I like the results, I don’t think I would use this everyday.",0.0
"I love love this sunscreen!! It is light weight,smells clean,I actually had no problem wearing it under my makeup and I love it doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy and greasy!!! I would recommend this product to any and everyone looking for a nice sunscreen!! The sunscreen was gifted by Sephora and I very much loved the opportunity to give it a try thank you!!",1.0

"I love this product! After using it for a few weeks (morning and night) I feel my dark circles have significantly reduced! It leaves my under eyes looking fresh and feeling smooth, moisturized, lighter and brighter. A little of this product goes a long way. I love the applicator, it feels like I am getting a personal spa treatment while providing a cooling application- so necessary for this area and concern. It is perfect for light make up days and many work from home zoom calls leaving my face looking refreshed and awake! Truly a little miracle in a jar! I would highly recommend this product.",1.0
The scent is nice and it’s very thick. my lips have been peeling and very dry I bought this hoping it would help but it did nothing I got better results from using the Vaseline chapstick in the little pot what a waste of money :(,0.0
"I bought this after reading the reviews, and had high hopes for it. I liked it at first, the scent is fruity, the packaging is cute (ofcourse they got me at packing). Unfortunately, it didn’t do anything for my skin. The dry areas in my face still remained dry and patchy. It was too watery/runny for my liking. It did break me out, which I rarely breakout.",0.0
The second ingredient in the peel is Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B). Shame on me for not reading the ingredients. When l opened the packet it wreaked of alcohol. I tried it anyway because the darn stuff is so expensive. Dried my skin right up as that’s what alcohol denat. does. This ingredient should not be used on skin IMO. I can’t believe a good doctor (if he really is) would use it especially as the second ingredient. Also water acts as a neutralizer so the second packet really isn’t necessary. It’s really just baking soda. I don’t trust this guy and won’t be buying any of his products.,0.0
The best exfoliate for my skin! It’s very gentle on the skin; it leaves my skin smooth without tearing or irritating it. I use it in the evening and wake up with a smoother and brighter face! Highly recommend. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.,1.0
I have been using this every day for about 2 weeks now. I previously avoided eye products because they would always give me little bumps but this eye cream actively works to remove texture/bumps. I love the texture and ingredients plus the applicator is super quick and easy to use,1.0
"Disappointed. The retinol is doing the heavy lifting for this power couple. I like both products but it’s crazy how fast the GG Lactic Acid runs out. You can see how tiny the product pouch is inside the jar and there remaining product won’t pump out. Mine was gone in less than a month and I wasn’t overly liberal with it.  I don’t think this product is a good value at all. I’ll continue to use the Luna Retinol and there’s plenty of that considering you only need a couple drops at a time, but I will be looking for a different brand for the lactic acid treatment.",0.0
"Maybe this is just due to me being a novice, but this left my skin feeling a bit sticky after using it. It was odd as I wasn’t expecting that from this product. I’m not 100% what the benefit of this product is but I’m not a big fan of it after trying it a few times, but it’s part of the full facial treatment so I’ve been keeping with it.",0.0
"Ahhhh I wanted to enjoy this product because of the reviews and the price point bUT it did not work for me at all. Personally I didn’t enjoy the texture of it but that usually isn’t a huge deal to me. My main problem is that after every time I used this product, my skin would feel stripped, dry, and tight. I used it for around 3-4 weeks and all it did was make my skin feel unnourished after every time I used it. So now I am dealing with a pretty bad breakout because my skin is trying to compensate for the natural oils ripped away from me PLUS from the irritation from the salicylic acid. I don’t want to give it 1 star because I do have high hopes for this brand and believe that this product could work for someone else’s skin really well. Unfortunately, it just didn’t work for me.",0.0
"Super glowy, amazing base and sunscreen all in 1!! Not the best as a primer but looks decent under makeup. Definitely an everyday staple, a bit pricey but worth it!",1.0

My face really does feel more plump and supple, and I love love love the color of this serum. Absolutely a must have! Received complimentary from Algenist.",1.0
"I really wanted to like this and was excited to try it after all the great reviews. It goes on smoothly and isn’t sticky, but it doesn’t last long and I kept having to apply it, which then dried out my lips. Not worth the $ for that. Also, the berry has no color whatsoever.",0.0
Wasn’t too impressed slightly hydrating but not a game changer or noticeably. Dissapointing,0.0

"This raved about so I decided to try it.It honestly doesn’t do much if anything. I saw no effects, positive or negative.The marketing campaign is well done but seriously misleading. If Pitera is such a great ingredient, SKII needs to up their game and the Pitera levels in this product. Until this is revised, don’t waste your money - get a cheaper essence instead.I gave this three stars because I enjoyed using it but could not assign more because of its lack of umph. I could have easily assigned it two stars.",0.0
"I absolutely love this product, but I will say for new beginners. Be careful at first my skin felt like on fire the very first couple of times but now my skin has no reaction to it ￼ for people that are not used to putting strong exfoliating skin products on their skin. I strongly recommend to leave it on for at least 60 seconds instead of the full five minutes. ￼",1.0
"I bought this product after seeing it in one of my favorite makeup guru’s Instagram stories. It worked the first time that I used it as a daily moisturizer. However, the second time, I got small dry patches on each side of my face. The same thing happened a few more times after. I tried it as a primer and it DID NOT work. It made my foundation (Lancôme Teint Idole), for lack of a better word “melt” off of the top of my forehead (pictured below), and it made my concealer (NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer) very difficult to blend. It’s okay at best and should be used as an overnight mask if anything.",0.0

Really wanted this to work. Tried it for a month. I didn’t really like the texture it gave my skin (a slight white cast plus little clumps that is have to dust off).

"Great product! I love the quality of Clarins products, they always do what they promise and it’s a perfect price-value combo. This serum isn’t an exception! After a few days of using it I could see how much more smooth and glowy my skin started looking. I can’t say many things about anti aging effect, because I haven’t used it for long enough yet, but I’m sure the results won’t disappoint me. If you’re looking for a serum that will make your skin look more “alive”, help with skin tone, moisture and firmness - this is the one. Highly recommend",1.0
I love that it’s not an overbearing scent like most floral products. It’s very smooth and left my face feeling fresh and soft. I noticed after a day that my fine lines by my eyes looked softer as well. Excellent work.,1.0
"Was great the first time I used it. After that it develops a waxy layer from oils and dead skin. I recommend scraping the top layer off every use and always put it in the fridge the night before. I also wish it was square and not circular, would’ve been way better. Skin-wise, no noticeable difference. It just makes my skin feel stretchy after I use it. Not worth buying.

"I received the product free for testing purposes from Influenster and Tatcha. The product is very watery and it runs all down my hands while I’m trying to get it on my skin, the application process is not very user friendly for the price tag since your wasting a lot of product while your using it. With that being said it does leave my skin very hydrated and soft and my moisturizer goes on very well after. I probably wouldn’t purchase it after I run out just because the price tag is too big for a product that you waste half of it while your using it.",0.0

"I received these products for free from Influenster and Tatcha in exchange for my honest review...I’ve tried so many serums being a skincare junkie. I was a little skeptical when receiving this at first, because I wasn’t highly impressed with my other Tatcha products. To my surprise, i love this serum. It has a nice creamy texture and leaves my skin feeling smooth, hydrated & plump. I would defined recommend this to anyone looking for a new hydrating serum!#mydewyserum #complimentary @Tatcha @Influenster",1.0
I loved using this serum! It leaves my skin looking luminous and moisturized.  It’s very hydrating but absorbs pretty quickly into the skin without leaving an oily finish. I love products with ceramides. This one didn’t irritate my skin and it helped reduce redness that I normally get through the day. Definitely making it part of my regular routine.,1.0
"After using two weeks and only for night, the pump is not working and nothing goes out!!!",0.0
After using this product for a few nights I can already see a difference! I will definitely buy and recommend to friends. A+++,1.0
"Not a fan of this moisturizer. Really glad I got a sample instead of purchasing. It leaves your face feeling tacky, even when using a small amount. I didn’t particularly like the scent and didn’t find that it kept my skin looking matte like some other oil-free moisturizers do.I much rather prefer the Origins matte moisturizer with willowherb OR I just tried a sample of the Philosophy oil-free moisturizer and that also is amazing. Both are better alternatives in my opinion...",0.0
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and so far I love how light weight it is, it has a smooth buttery texture that isn’t heavy or filmy on my skin, has a great smell, and leaves my face dewy and evenly hydrated. Looking forward to continued use!",1.0
"very light on the skin and sits very well, but not worth the price",0.0
Causes comedonal acne (closed comedones). But very brightening. I stopped using it but if you never have issues with comedones then it might be worth a shot. Prefer the Caudalie brightening essence way more! Also the sugar in this can be an issue for yeast overgrowth on skin (fungal acne) so I don’t understand why it has fructose and glucose...,0.0
"Received this in my Play box and was excited to try it.   Im not usually sensitive to skin products, but my skin is red and burns.  Beware!",0.0
"It felt great on the skin. Additionally didn’t leave any weird residue on skin. Definitely a con was the smell. The smell was reminiscent of clay or play doh. It dissipated after you washed it off, but it wasn’t a great smell.",0.0
I received this free to test out. It’s a really great formula. Extremely light weight and no white cast.,1.0
"Was excited to try this, glad I only got the sample size. I used it once, sadly won’t try it again (or any of the Tatcha products) because it left my skin red and irritated, with whiter patches in the middle of my cheeks. I have normal skin, I use a much more heavy duty exfoliator from my derm, there aren’t many exfoliation beads in this product so not sure why it left my cheeks in such a mess. However I do think it smells great, despite what other reviews are saying.",0.0
This treatment helped to calm my skin and even out the color before applying makeup. I usually always have to wear foundation to hide my redness and this helped tremendously!,1.0
"Way overpriced for something I could make from home. It worked as expected but be aware the cost is a bit much for what it offers. Product details: smells good, definitely an exfoliating scrub.",0.0
"I have combo acne prone skin. Even though this is oil based it has definitely balanced my skin and cleaned out my pores. My acne is definitely much better, and I have only been using this for 4 weeks. Also my skin is more vibrant. I read the reviews before hand and it does leave your skin feeling almost dewy, but it’s definitely not greasy after! Perfect cleanser removes my stubborn mascara without vigorous rubbing.",1.0
"I was looking for an exfoliater for my large pores and oily skin around my nose.  This product is gentle, smells like summer, and I have notice a marked improvement in my pores.  The product is well worth the price point.  A little of it goes a long away.",1.0
I received a free sample of bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum from PinchMe. I love this product. It felt so natural on my skin. It left my skin feeling soft and rejuvenated. It made my skin look so healthy and I loved how it felt.,1.0
The product works well for my skin and feels great but smells gross unfortunately,1.0
"The formula changed. I’m so disappointed. I loved the original formula, but the last one I purchased is thicker and doesn’t give me the instant firming feeling that protini used to provide.",0.0
This sunscreen is so lightweight and a little goes such a long way. Not greasy and doesn’t make me look shiny. Sits nicely under makeup. Will definitely purchase again.,1.0
"Feels a little expensive for the size / brand. Overall, felt good and didn’t sting when applied. Not noticing a difference yet, but only have used for a week.",1.0
"I’ve received  these as gift for my honest  review. I’ve used  the pad once so far. Once a week is all you need.  They work very well to clean old skin cells off the surface, making skin look younger with a slight glow. Don’t use too often or it will irritate your skin. I use moisturizer after the peel dries. Rinse off in the morning and add sun screen as this is important as the acid in the peel can burn skin onto a week after you use the peel. Man it makes a huge difference my skin is super soft and glows making me appear younger. Will be buying these for sure again.",1.0
"I’m truly in love with the new Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dew Drops that was recently launched by glowrecipe. It’s smells of watermelon and is amazingly glowy on the face. I tried it on without makeup for my Teams meeting and I was so impressed how shiny and bright my skin looked on camera. I also tried mixing it with my foundation for a glowy, dewy look. It melts into the skin, making the skin shiny.Needless to say, the packing is super cute & I love a glowy look *product was gifted by Glow recipe*",1.0
GET THIS PRODUCT ASAP!! This is the best night cream i’ve ever used and will continue to use for a very long time! Recommend for acne prone skin!!,1.0
"Immediately pills all over my face and falls off. What a waste of money. Also makes my skin look too oily. Instead of dewy and glowy, I looked greasy and then about 15 mins later, it had all fallen off my face. Disappointing all around.",0.0
"This is my new favorite tool in my skincare routine. The results were instantaneous — it cleared acne starting on day 1, gave me a fresh glow, and reduced pores. With longer term use, I’m noticing it’s clarifying my skin tone. I use it daily and although it slightly intense, it feels like the only product that truly rejuvenates my skin.",1.0
"Whilst I’m sure this creme works well on parched skin I found it to be too heavy and my skin simply wouldn’t absorb it (and I was applying with a very light hand). Used overnight it was okay but as a daytime moisturizer it just sat on my skin making me feel sticky and shiny. The smell is pleasant and the creme is rich and indulgent and I have discovered it works incredibly well when used on the lips overnight. I may even purchase again simply for this reason. As a moisturizer though, on normal skin, I find it to be just too intense.",0.0
Such a wonderful product! I love the smooth texture and thick consistency. Super hydrating and smells delish,1.0

SO happy I gave this a try! I was skeptical at first since I am a die hard glossier balm dotcom girl but this product is my new go to. I’ve only used it for 3 days and it has already saved my dry winter skin and lips!,1.0
"Did absolutely nothing. In fact, I think it made me more oily throughout the day.",0.0
"I gave this 3 stars because of 2 key reasons. 1) it DOES work. It melts off every ounce of make up and let’s you remove it with EASE. It’s so nice. But on the other hand 2) it killed my skin. I’ve never suffered from acne. I’ve used the same products for years (drunk elephant as well). But after using this product for 2 weeks, my face is so bumpy and texturized, there’s nothing I can do to hide it. Acne EVERYWHERE. This product rocks... unless you have sensitive skin... then please don’t buy this.",0.0
"I was very excited to receive this product (for review purposes, all opinions are my own) however it did nothing for my skin. I used it for about three weeks and saw no noticeable difference in my skin. It didn’t look for feel different. So unfortunate",0.0
"Results after one use. I had a sample of this sitting around for who knows how long. Finally tried it and l am so glad l did. This is maybe one of hundreds of products that l feel like gives results with one use. This is something l will use forever. Definitely a gentler, better substitute for Exfolikate.",1.0
"I enjoy how much of the product comes in the package relative to other packaging where it isn’t filled to the top, but I’m not the biggest fan of the product. I don’t hate it, but I also don’t love it. I find that rather than making my skin feel super hydrated, it makes my skin feel a bit tight relative to other moisturizers, so if you like that then you’ll like this product. I also am not a huge fan of the smell of this product. I received this product sample for free to try.",0.0
"I really wanted to like this. The smell is amazing, it removes makeup well, unfortunately, it didn’t work for my reactive, dry skin. It broke me out and dried out my skin tons. I’m just glad they have a mini size that was only $10 because I hate returning open products. I guess my search for a gentle hydrating cleanser continues",0.0
"Been using this for 3 year, my skin has become so dry that it flakes off. I cannot even wear make up anymore because of how much texture i have. And yes i exfoliate. It just dries out my skin like crazy.",0.0
"I was really excited for this, but it fell flat. It’s a watery gel-cream. The second you start to spread it out, it feels like you’re spreading water around. I guess I was just hoping for something that felt a little more…substantial on the face?? I would say it’s medium hydrating. It does leave the skin looking very shiny, almost oily rather than glass skin. Overall, not impressed and won’t buy again.",0.0
Leaves my lips soft and supple in the morning. Hydrated lips all winter long.,1.0
"I’m very very disappointed with this product. I have an oily skin but not too bad. I decided to give it a try because it has good reviews. But if I had the choice, I would definitely give this product a zero. I spent almost 100 bucks on this brand (face wash   toner   moisturizer). The first time I used the face wash, I noticed a small breakout on my forehead. I thought, you know, maybe my skin is reacting to this new product so i kept using it, with the toner and moisturizer. this is the 2nd week I’ve been using this product and I decided to stop 5 minutes ago after I took a shower. I was so disappointed when I look at myself in the mirror because I saw tons of new breakouts, 22 to be exact, 22! I have NO breakout before I used this product. Zero! Oh my god. I don’t know. I’m disappointed. My skin is at the worst state it has ever been right now. I feel like I wanna cry right now. I would NOT recommend this product at all. Yes it does get rid some of the oil, but it also gives you tons of breakout. I’m not sure if I still can get a refund. I’m so disappointed, very very disappointed.",0.0
I just love this sunscreen! I swear every time I am wearing it and i look at the mirror i am just amazed from the result. It’s still natural look but at the same time you will be glowing. Thats everyone’s dream. Its easy to apply and doesn’t stick or stay on your finger no need for a brush as long as you have CLEAN hands,1.0
I really didn’t know what to expect from using an essence this is the first one I’ve ever used. It’s super watery and sinks into the skin quickly. Doesn’t have a scent which is shocking for this brand. I think it had made a difference for my acne prone skin. I really enjoy using this product but I would not recommend it to anyone else because of the price tag and the fact that the brand is not cruelty free.,0.0
I was shocked to see this was a solid instead of a cream product. It melts with the touch of your hand and has a nice pleasant scent that doesn’t linger. It’s soft and not overly hydrating if you have oily skin. Love that my skin feels soft and moisturized but not oily in the morning. I really have been enjoying it. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are your own.,1.0
This face wash removes all my makeup flawlessly and leaves me skin feeling hydrated afterwards. My face also feels firm and there is a tightening effect,1.0
"I love this Brand, but not a fan if this product.  Leaves my face very sticky?!?!?!?  I know this is a highly favored product and so I’ll have to investigate into why this leaves a sticky film behind. The tackiness doesn’t dissipate either.",0.0
"After using this product for a month and a half I cannot see any visible changes. I have seen better results with cheaper products. The product is also difficult to use, you have to take the product out with a little spatula every time.",0.0
"I’m really liking this product. It goes on smooth and creamy, is not greasy, and feels luxurious. I think the appearance around my eyes looks good good, though I haven’t noticed a tremendous difference yet. I’m going to keep using it though.",1.0
Didn’t give me lasting moisture and burned when I applied it.,0.0
"I have been wanting to try this primer for a really long time because I’ve seen so many people hype it up and say it’s great. After applying it on my skin however, I’ve noticed that my skin feels less flaky and dry, i was not expecting this reaction but i am honestly impressed! It is a great two in one product that i recommend",1.0
"I had high hopes for this product, but it was pretty average. I have pale skin, and it still left a bit of a white cast. It’s also pretty dry and pilled under my makeup even though I waited for it to dry down. I wasn’t able to return it, so I’ve been mixing it with moisturizer to not waste it.",0.0
I didn’t love this product. I felt like the caramel one was much better at keeping my lips hydrated and this one just felt waxy.,0.0
I love this! I went to Florida and needed an amazing sunscreen and this did not disappoint. It actually lightened some sun spots. I am very happy with this product! I received it for free to try from Influenster and I will repurchase.,1.0
"The cream is okay, but definitely not worth the price.  The consistency is very thick, so I only wear it at night;  however, I do not notice any improvements in my skin that would justify the price point.",0.0
"I want to love this cleanser. But I find this cleanser doesn’t really take off all the dirt on my face. The product claims to leave a brighten look and clean feeling after wash, but I did no feel so. The ingredient does contain alcohol which is something I do not wish to have in any of my skincare product. For the price point, I think it’s not worth it.",0.0
I received this complimentary from Influenster. The cream smells like cucumbers I honestly enjoy It so much. I rinse my face every morning and could feel the cream washing off my face which means It lasts throughout the night. Recommend :),1.0
Very tiny sample wasn’t really able to figure out if it works or not. It did however made my skin feel smooth and soft. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox,0.0
"This product didn’t work for me. I have hormonal acne every once in a while, but lately it’s been pretty bad. Like huge bumps under my skin along my chin/jawline area. I would put this on the area every night with no difference after almost two weeks. Going back to try Eradikate’s spot treatment to see if that works better.",0.0
"I am loving the moisturizing bomb! I actually layer it on top of the aqua bomb and it works great. I personally prefer products with a pump so that I don’t have to dig my fingers in and get product under my nails but I was able to compromise. The moisturizing bomb is lightweight, not really a scent but moisturizing! Does well in colder temperatures.",0.0
"Perfect for my skin! Change is not noticeable immediately, but I have been using this product for about a month now and I’ve noticed some fading with acne scars. I only have like 3 spots of acne scars on my cheek and it was red prior to using this product, but now it has faded. (: I just reordered more and going to try Azelaic Acid to get rid of the scar even more.",1.0
"I have sensitive skin and was looking for a good serum.  I used this for about a week.  Here are the results:1. I now see pores in my forehead that I have never seen before - like my whole forehead.2. The rest of my face looks like I got sunburned - redness, splotchy skin, and peeling ?!?  Not a happy camper.  It’s going to take a few weeks to recover I fear.",0.0
"Applying this balm to dry skin feels really pleasing. Not oily and no residue. It does take care of waterproof mascara, however, you do have to let it sit. Or use it twice...once to get the initial makeup off, and then a second go around after you rinse and dry takes off the rest. My only con is that it takes a while to breakdown the mascara, but it does get there. So far the mini size has lasted me a long time.",1.0
"Just didn’t feel very hydrating. Left my skin begging for more moisture lol. The scent is nice, but didn’t do much for me. Didn’t last very long. Didn’t break me out though so that’s a plus!",0.0
in three days i broke out with huge red bumps. was the only new skin care product in my regimen. i stopped using it and my skin cleared up. idk a cleanser has never made me break out. not sure how “clean” it is.,0.0
This moisturizer is great for combo skin. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily and moisturizes well. Lasts a long time and is a good price!,1.0
I really wanted to love this and was having hormonal breakouts (or so I thought) while I was trying this out. I took a break from it when I was traveling and almost instantly the breakouts on my chin subsided. I used this again last night for the first time in two weeks and woke up to three massive breakouts on my chin and cheek. It’s a good Cleanser but just not for me.,0.0
"I have struggled with acne since I was 13. I’ve been using this product for about 3 years now, and at 23 I still love it. Nothing has helped combat my acne more. This stuff works.",1.0

Amazing! Great moisture and amazing glow.,1.0
"I wasn’t really sure what to expect with this product. However, I was slightly dissatisfied that it stung a bit upon putting it on my skin. It was lightweight, but I have pretty sensitive skin and rosacea. It seemed to firm my skin up but it did burn a bit upon use. I’m sure this would work better  for someone who doesn’t have skin sensitivity.",0.0
"I’m not sure why, but this completely damaged my skin. My skin was red and itchy with tiny little bumps. This also provided no moisture for me, within two hours of application my skin was very tight and dry",0.0

"This is a rich moisturizer that doesn’t break me out and leaves me with a gorgeous glow. I will say that on its own it does not recover my dry winter skin, retinol dryness and mineral sunscreen dehydration, but it definitely is a key player in the improvement of my skin. When I use this layered under ointment on dry patches, my skin looks incredible when I wake up. I really love that it is rich without silicones so I can layer my products. I love how it absorbs and feels on my skin. Most moisturizers sit and drag over my dry, textured parts but this is incredibly emollient. Also, I love the subtle honey smell and the jar is a bonus. I haven’t found a moisturizer that I love as much as this one and I’ve tried so many. If you have very dry skin and use a lot of peels, acids or retinols, this is for you.",1.0
"I received this product as a free sample — I have used it morning and night for about one month, I find that it is very hydrating for my dry skin, I still need to use a primer for makeup",1.0
I have dry skin and this cream is really moisturizing. If you have the money and would like to try this out go for it.,1.0
My first review….but I’ll write it because this little jar is worth it! I’ve been searching for a product like this to help take the red out of my coloring. It really helps makes the skin look wayyy more polished for the no-makeup days.,1.0
This smells like skittles and it stings more than other AHA toners.,0.0
"I received this product for free to test out, I love the smell of this product, however, my skin was purging with it for a small while so now I am not using it everyday because I really want to put this product to the test. So far so good and im still using it, a little goes a long way with this stuff. I have noticed a difference with the texture of my skin and its getting smoother the more I use it and my face doesn’t feel as dry like it did in the past.",1.0
"This stuff is nice and refreshing, but honestly I really do not think it is a useful part of a skincare routine. It does not feel moisturizing, and essentially just makes your skin feel wet. It doesn’t feel bad, but it just seems pretty pointless.",0.0
"Great product, it really transformed my skin, my skin is balanced, smooth and glowing. It didn’t cause my skin to break out. Works greatly with makeup. Perfect for winters. My pores have reduced, acne scars have disappeared, and my skin looks very fresh and lively, which I have never experienced with any other product. I use the treatment lotion before the cream, and I think the effect is greater that way. Best part is I haven’t had a single dry patch for the past month ever since I started using this.",1.0
"It’s OK. I don’t really understand the cult following. Similar to the Kiehls lip balm, I find myself reapplying it constantly.",0.0
Got a sample of this after all the hype and I am honestly not impressed.  It is a thick mess.  I followed instructions and it was way too thick and sticky.  I had to actually wash my face to take it off.  Glad I did not pay this ridiculous price for this.  There are ton of other products that tone and heal the skin for a fraction of the price.,0.0
"I’m so new to the world of beauty. Mid 30s Just started caring for my skin. I love this product it has now become part of my daily am & pm routine. It works just great, it revives my skin, there is no dullness and it feels super soft. Ps love the bottle, perfect to measure and usage",1.0
"This provides decent hydration but you really have to scoop out a lot for it to feel like a mask. Mostly feels just like a balm unless you really get in there. I’m not a huge fan of the scent either—lightly fruity, but with something “off.” Not terrible but there are better lip masks out there.",0.0
Absolutely love this product so much!! I use it everyday! It’s literally that gentle! it doesn’t break me out at all!,1.0
"This works incredibly well at making my eyes much less puffy. I am always super puffy in the morning, and I use this daily to stop it around my eyes. It even works after crying the night before, which makes me so puffy I look like I’ve had a bad allergic reaction. This one stick has lasted me over a year of daily use.",1.0

It sits on top of the skin and has a very thick finish and if you try to apply anything on top of it, like I tried - with serum and moisturizer, everything starts to flake.

"After reading the many reviews that praised this product to be the holy grail and the solve to all their skin problems, I got the entire Sunday Riley set, mostly for the Good Gene’s though. Unfortunately, none of them did anything for me. I think this one broke me out too. Don’t fall into the trap and shed out dollars. Try the samples, sure, and be wary before investing in the full size. I’m short a 100$ and no shortage of skin problems.",0.0

I’ve been using it for a few weeks now, and haven’t noticed an increase in breakouts etc, which is always a concern for me when using oils. Very satisfied!",1.0
"This is an ideal product for the first step of a double cleanse. You scoop out about a nickel sized amount with the enclosed spatula, and it dissolves into a lovely light oil when you rub it into your skin. It emulsifies easily and rinses off well.

"This is my first time trying the Sunday Riley brand.  I have heard great things about the brand.  This is the Sunday Riley Good Genes all-in-one Lactic acid treatment.It is powered by lactic acid for exfoliation of dull, dead skin cells. It contains balancing botanicals of licorice, lemongrass, arnica and prickly pear extract.The licorice is for radiance and brightening. The lemongrass as an astringent and skin refresher for toned complexion. Arnica and prickly pear extract to sooth the skin.It touts boosting naturally youthful radiance, while visibly reducing the look of lines, wrinkles, and dark spots. To instantly plump the look of fine lines, and wrinkles. In using product for several days now, my first impression is that the skin feels exfoliated exposing smoother and clearer skin.  It feels nice.  I do not see a difference yet of reducing fine lines, wrinkles or dark spots. I plan on continuing use of this treatment serum product to see the full effects and benefits of its use.  I do have some dark spots on my face from sun exposure that I would like to see faded or diminished.  And I want my skin to look and feel amazing. With daily use, hopefully this product will brighten, hydrate, soothe, exfoliate, and clarify softer and smoother younger looking skin.I appreciate that this product is cruelty free and vegan.

"I first used this during my mid twenties when ANR was still the original formula - before it underwent god knows how many reincarnations. Back then I used to find it would help a little with the odd acne mark that would appear every few weeks but did little else for my skin concerns. I was primarily using it in the hopes of some sort of defense against future ageing, but I can’t say whether or not it achieved anything, as once the bottle ran out I started using other products and then recently thought why not give it another go?So onto the latest version ’Synchronized Recovery Complex’ which I tried earlier this year. I don’t know if it’s the fact that ’Tocopherol Acetate’ (Vitamin E) has been pushed down to 30th place on ingredients list (used to be 13th), or whether it’s because ’Retinyl Palmitate (an ester of Vitamin A) has been completely removed from the new version, but this one didn’t do anything for acne marks whatsoever and I used it for over a month. It makes sense as both of those ingredients, especially Vitamin A in any form, are known to help fade marks. Add to that a whole host of new and unpronounceable ingredients and that probably explains why if anything I’d experienced even more breakouts when using this...although which one (or more) of the many new ingredients is the culprit I couldn’t say!

"Initially, I liked the smell and the hydrating texture of this cleanser. After having it a month or two, it smelled like it had gone rancid. There was no expiration date on the container. I had to throw it out.",0.0
This product left my skin feeling flawless and smooth. I use this product in the AM before applying my makeup but after I cleansed my face. Made putting my makeup on smooth and didn’t leave my makeup feeling cakey.,1.0
"Cons, small wipes, no coconut scent & didn’t remove my makeup very well. Pros, good small packaging for travel.",0.0
super hydrating and leaves a great glowy finish. I have oily skin and was worried this would turn me into a grease ball but it didn’t at all! A perfect glow.,1.0
"I have very large pores and am prone to breakouts and blackheads and this scrub definitely helped to handle those! I’ve purchased it twice now and have been happy with the results. The only reason it isn’t 5 stars is because of the price point. Great product, price is a little high... but it lasts about 4 months for me so if you’re willing to spend the money it’ll work!",1.0
"I was very disappointed with this cleanser. I thought it would be gentle enough to use on dry skin, but I found it dried out my already parched skin. This may work well for someone with oily skin, but is not great for us who are a bit on the dry side.",0.0
I got this in a Sephora Favorites kit and was very impressed on how great it works and feels light on my face. Takes off makeup great! I do have the Cinique Take Off the Day balm and this one has a better feel than Clinique.,1.0
I got this as a reward because I wanted to try this brand. I heard so many good things about it but unfortunately I did not like this. I have very sensitive skin (it used to be very bad a couple years ago but has got a little better ) this immediately made my skin become all bumpy and red. It was also very very light so I’d feel you would need to use a decent amount for your face.,0.0
"I received Charlotte’s Magic cream for free in exchange for my honest review. Magic cream is a lovely moisturizer. It has niacinamide as a main ingredient which is amazing for improving pores, texture, fine lines and more. The cream is very thick so a little goes a long way. It has a mild rose scent that fades after about an hour. My sensitive acne prone skin loves this moisturizer. I have been using it as my exclusive moisturizer morning and at night for the last couple weeks so I could write an honest review. Definitely recommend and will buy again!",1.0
"This product did help with evening out the redness in my skintone. The greenish tint helps cancel out the red, but also leaves your skin with a natural toned finish. It has a similar finish that a BB or CC cream would, but the product itself feels thicker than BB or CC cream.Also like that it contains SPF keeps you protected from sun damage. I did find that throughout the day this product does tend to separate and kinda looks blotchy on my skin..",1.0
Too thick and greasy for me. Gonna pass on this one.,0.0
I really wanted to love this. It didn’t really do anything for me.,0.0
"It is smells good, but the scent is too strong. After using it for 2 days, I had a bad skin reaction, chemical burn all over my face. It stings all over. My face was so red!",0.0
"I LOVE this cream. I started Tret (Retin-A) in January and needed some TLC for dry, sensitive skin. This product hydrates like a dream, plays nice with other products, and absorbs so nicely. Many people have nightmares with tret (include dry, flakey skin), but I haven’t, and I think a lot of that comes down to this product. I’ve recommended this to most of my friends/clean beauty lovers at this point, and have no negatives. I’ll gladly pay the price for this product. (For context: my skincare routine is Tatcha one-step oil cleanser, layer of tret, HERBIVORE Emerald Hemp Seed Deep Moisture Glow Oil, and then this on top! Finish with eye cream)",1.0
I love this serum! It gives me great radiance even with my matte foundations like Chanel Ultra ale Teint and Eatee Lauder Double Wear that usually are resistant. My makeup applies beautifully over it. Will definitely re-purchase.,1.0
"I got this as using large amounts of salicylic acid is harsh on my sensitive skin, but targeted areas did great. Good product that helps acne not get worse and heal faster. A bit on the expensive side.",1.0
"I redeemed some points for the Tatcha water cream and cleanser set after reading tons of reviews. I’m glad I opted to use points instead of purchasing. I wasnt impressed. I dont feel like it does a ton in terms of moisturizing. I think it would be okay as a light moisturizer for oily skin or in a humid climate, hence the 3 stars. But if you need anything more than a very light moisturizer, I would look for something else.",0.0
I received this product as a gift and instantly fell in love! I have very sensitive skin so exfoliates easily irritate. This product softly exfoliates the skin and leaves it soft and smooth! I highly recommend this product! Gifted by Dermalogica sampling.,1.0

"Super hydrating cream. Perfect for everyday use. It feels very cooling. My skin is dry-combination so I need an additional serum for full hydration. But for normal or oily skin, this is perfect !! I received a free sample from Influenster.",1.0
"I Love this moisturizer!! I have oily / acne prone skin and I have always struggled with finding the right moisturizer. They either left my skin too oily or dried it out. Before switching to this, I was using clinique and was still experiencing break outs here and there. This water cream has answered my prayers, it leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and glowy without making me greasy. It does give me that healthy glow. I was so amazed by this product I went back to sephora and bought the cleanser as well. It is definitely worth the money. I’m already on my second jar.",1.0

"I tried both the Water Cream and the Deep Cleanse Exfoliating Cleanser from TATCHA and I would not recommend either one of these products. I did like the cleanser more than the cream and I thought it was a great exfoliator. however, the cleanser had a very unappealing scent.",0.0
"Everyone raves about this cleanser, so I picked up the mini to give it a go. I found that it stripped my skin more than I would like a cleanser too. I tend to have combination/dry skin and would not recommend it to people with similar skin types. Smell is nice though and it lathers up nicely. I do love that YTTP uses glass to package their products though!",0.0
have been using this eye cream since I received it as a gift from Influenster for a few weeks now. I have seen a small difference in the lines under my eyes and crow feet. This product is light weight and feels silky as you apply and is very smooth after applying. I will definitely continue to use!,1.0
I’ve suffered with acne since a teenager. Using retin a since I was 15 really took a toll on my skin. I was extremely sensitive to any product. I had to use avenno body lotion on my face because it was the only product sensitive enough that can some what moisturize my face. My face  was always very red and sensitive. I finally decided to use something different 10 yrs later . I have to say this is a miracle worker. Overnight it toned down the inflammation of my blemishes. I have been using it for about a month. I did go through a “purging “ period but it was all gone within the 3rd week of using this product. I highly recommend this for acne/sensitive skin. It’s a game changer,1.0
It’s very lightweight and a little goes a long way! My skin feels smoother and stays hydrated the entire day!,1.0
"I really like this! I have acne prone combo skin and while this is too strong to use twice daily, I use it nightly after oil cleansing to remove makeup and it is a really great clean. If you’re combo like me I recommend to use it once daily and in the morning use some kind of toner, I use micellar water and or a Lush cleanser some days in the mornings instead as they’re not a strong cleanser. But yeah love this honestly, my skin likes it better than the Cerave foaming cleanser (that was too stripping)",1.0
"I can see why some love it and why some hate it. I’m in the latter camp. I have super dry lips and this is mediocre in non winter months and awful during winter. My lips feel drier with it on in winter. I so wanted to love it. To prospective buyers, if you have no lip conditions and “normal” lips, or it’s not winter, I might give this a go. But it seems to exacerbate severe dryness. Heal your lips first and then try for preventive care.",0.0

I found The Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Serum to be average in its hydrating ability.

I probably would not repurchase this product. For reference I have dry skin, age early forties.",0.0

"Absolute garbage! My entire beauty routine is Clinique and I am shocked they sell this product. This “soap“ cannot remove foundation, eye shadow, lipstick, mascara, etc. (and I do not use waterproof products). I have to follow up with another non-Clinique product just to properly cleanse my skin.  This has caused horrible breakouts on my skin. Rather than washing away the day, it cakes your makeup back into your pores and leaves behind an oily residue. I would never recommend this product.",0.0
"I love this product so much. It really does what it is supposed to do. I use twice a day with the toner and moisturizer. I am absolutely in love with this brand, I love not only their products, but also their values! I have pretty much all the products, they are completely vegan, sustainable and their ingredients are very clean. I’ve been using it for approximately two months and my skin is glows! I had a video call with a Youth to the People specialist and she told me about all the products and how I should use them. The products are not expensive and they are amazing! I am saving so much money, because now I don’t need get a facial every month. If you not sure if you should buy it, definitely do! Buy it!",1.0
"Not sure how I really feel about this product, I have only used it a few times. However, I do feel like it covers redness and evens out my skintone quite nicely. I can see this being a go to when I don’t want to wear makeup but do want a bit of coverage. I also like that is has SPF to it so it will be great for summer time. I did notice that my skin felt a tad bit oily when I apply this, nothing major but just an observation. I will keep playing with it, but so far it seems like a nice product.",1.0

"I’ve been using this for about 6 years now and I’ve never had a problem with it. I have very oily skin and it has never broken me out - whether in Chicago winters or Houston heat & humidity. Feels lightweight and keeps my skin soft. It does have dye in it, so be careful if you’re sensitive to that. I love this product but might switch it out for something more affordable and dye-free like CeraVe once it runs out.",1.0

"The 5 Stars Retinoid + Niacinamide Eye Serum’s ceramic applicator tip helps the serum glide on perfectly and leaves my under eye area feeling refreshed with a cooling sensation, I love that. The silky smooth texture is amazing and leaves my under eye area feeling soft. I do notice a bit of a dewy, shiny look after applying but I take that as it is hydrating the area. Looking forward to using this in my nighttime skincare routine and getting rid of any puffiness or bags under my eyes. The ingredients are super too. It’s a bit pricey for an eye cream but if it works, I’m all for it.",1.0
I have very dry skin. But get a lot of hormonal acne so i also have a lot of hyper pigmentation frompicking at my skin constantly. Saw rawbeautykristi talk about this and decided to try to it since the price was great. fast forward and i’m now about to purchase my third bottle. this has helped get rid of years worth of scarring and actually helps me not break out as often. if i go a couple days without it i can see a difference. i’ve seen people talk about the smell but i never notice it when i’m applying. if you have a lot of scarring give this at least a week or so to start working. i will always make sure i have this on hand from now on.,1.0
It left white little clumps all over my face. I don’t know if it’s caused by putting it after another kind of product on my face but I’m not the only one with that problem it seems… It’s also kinda expensive for so little of product,0.0

"It’s a very thorough cleanser, so three stars for that. It definitely gets every atom of dirt or sweat or makeup off my face. But-and this may just be because I’m currently living in an extremely dry climate- I’m finding it VERY drying. And I usually have oily skin. After washing my face with this, I can literally see the dry patches on my face pop up and it feels so tight. I love DE, but I’ll be sticking with Peekee Bar from now on.",0.0
I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with dry skin. I never get pimples but after using it for few days for my blackheads my skin started to breakout. Save yourself the trouble and don’t use this.,0.0

Love this product! I’ve tried several different eye creams and found this one to be the best for me in terms of reducing fine lines. It’s affordable and absorbs readily. It does not get rid of my under eye circles but it does brighten! It also goes well under my under eye concealers. love. love. love,1.0

I’ve never used a Tatcha product but always heard amazing hype around it so i was a little skeptical that a product could be that great....BUT THIS IS AMAZING, the smell is amazing. The scent is minimal, but fresh & smells so clean. The texture is so gentle, but does exfoliate lightly. I have absolutely loved this & will continue to purchase this when I’m completed!",1.0
This is a great moisturizer. I keep this in my work bag in case I forget my daily moisturizer. This is really good to use after a scrub and/or mask. If it had SPF it could replace my daily moisturizer.,1.0
I almost returned this product the first time I purchased it when I realized it may be too harsh for dry skin. SOOO glad I kept it! It actually gently exfoliates all the dry skin and leaves my face in a “neutral“ state. I use many TATCHA products including the ESSENCE. I use the DEEP CLEANSE once a day and the TATCHA’S other cleansers at night.,1.0
Not the best lip balm. For me it didn’t retain moisture.,0.0
"Affordable, simple, and gentle for my sensitive skin! I can see why this is always sold out at my local ulta.  The consistency is like a watery gel; layer friendly if you use multiple products. Absorbs quickly into the skin.. almost gives me a satin finish? Not heavy at all which i love. Normally i hate serums because of that. As far as clearing up the skin, it’s not an overnight miracle. But it does tone down redness and inflammation with my cystic acne. Be patient with niacinamide- if you’re not familiar with it, it does take a while to give you the results you want.",1.0
Clears all the gunk out of your skin. Every time I use this I also just absolutely glow. I love it,1.0
"I’ve used this for a few days in a row and it wasn’t what I had hoped. I normally use Tatcha’s Deep Cleanse and this is very different from that. I have oily, combination skin and felt like although this cleanser did leave my skin clean and super soft, it also left it incredibly oily. I also had more small breakouts and got those deep cystic pimples in my cheeks :/ I really wanted to love this but I’m sticking with the Deep Cleanse for a while",0.0
"Overall this is a very nice cleanser. The texture is lovely and does turn into a thin, although rich foam when lathered. I do feel as though my skin is softer and smoother after only using it a few times so far. The only reason I took off a star is that I don’t love the scent; it almost reminds me of an alcoholic drink.",1.0
Gentle yet effective remove all my makeups. Perfect for my sensitive skin,1.0
"This product was gifted to me for an honest review. I’m so excited to finally say that I found my favorite exfoliator. Every time I use it my skin feels so soft, especially in my problem areas like my nose and chin. A little bit of the product goes a long way. My skin type is dry and This didn’t make me drier which I’m so thankful. I love that it’s clean product, if you’re sensitive I believe this will work for you as well.",1.0
"I got it in a foreo set. Love how is motorized my skin without making it greasy. I used it during 2 weeks and can say that it doesn’t break me out. Works wonderful with the serum from the same line, I use both during the day. I will definetly repurchase.",1.0
"Kora Organics became part of my morning routine & makeup routine and I absolutely love it! I apply 4 drops of product and let me tell you that’s more than enough, a little bit goes a long way. The consistency is amazing, such a soft feeling when massaging my face with the oil and it smells so nice. I usually have oily skin so I’ve always stayed away from oils but lately I’ve been having really dry skin and by using Kora Organics Noni Glow Face Oil and their moisturizer I’ve noticed a bit change on my skin. The dryness is going away and my skin looks so smooth now.",1.0

"felt like a cheap fragranced moisturizer, it made my face feel like I was wearing a mask and changed the color of my foundation",0.0
I tried these a couple times on my face only. I saw hardly any color on my face after using it two days in a row and the little color that was there washed right off. Maybe this was meant to be a one night wear but the directions are vague so it’s unclear what to expect or how the apply.,0.0
I used this for the first time yesterday. At first I put on too much and I did not like it at all. I tried it again before bed and I’m so glad I did. I put on a thin layer and it was perfect. It felt so good! I woke up during the night and noticed my lips still had a nice amount of product on them. When I woke up this morning my lips were very moisturized. I am very happy with this product. Definitely will be included in my nighttime routine.,1.0

This product did not do anything for my skin but it also didn’t break me out or have a bad texture or smell so I’m giving it 3 stars.

I have dry skin type.,0.0
"This product is not worth the hype. It has a STRONG and overpowering smell that I could not get past. Also, the smallest size is hard to dispense the product from, you have to put it upside and tap it into your open palm, and then spread it to your face. A lot of product is lost this way.",0.0
Amazing product ! I felt the difference on my skin after one use. I never really add reviews but I had to on this because I love how my skin feels now. I am always looking forward to using it at the end of the day or before getting ready to go out. Highly recommended❤️,1.0
"I really like the cooling effect the moisturizing gel has on reactive skin, and the package is nice and convenient. But I have combination acne prone skin, and this product really made me break out. Also note, moisturizing is different than hydrating, so if you have dry/flaky skin, this product is not for you.",0.0
I am returning this because it broke me out. Homosalate in sunscreen is terrible for you. It does have a nice consistency,0.0

Confidence in a Cream really delivers. Let me start by saying I am in the over 65 club. My skin  is extremely dry especially around the mouth since I started using Confidence in a Cream my skin  feels and looks so much smoother and silkier.

"I will say this has made me dark spots on my chin go away drastically, but on my forehead they haven’t at all. I also started to get small breakouts on my face and I don’t have sensitive skin. Overall, I’m not sure if this product is worth the price.",0.0
"My chin is a problem area, you could look at it the wrong way and it would freakout and instantly produce a cluster of cystic acne! Its very annoying, I’ve tried many a toner and all with poor results. I’ve woken up with some very angry uninvited guests living on my chin. I was hesitant to try this, but thought I’d give it a shot and I am very surprised how well this toner worked. It helped clear up at least 60% of the weird little bumps I have on my chin and is very helpful when I feel a monster zit trying to make an appearance. Within about a day after applying, I’ll notice a difference. I definitely recommend using it once every second day, as it does have a bit of a drying effect, but its a zit be gone solution! The price is great and you don’t have to use too much, so it will last forever. I use it with a drugstore hyaluronic acid moisturizer and my skin is lovely afterwards.",1.0
Really wasn’t sure it was doing much of anything after 4 months use and 3 2oz bottles so I decided to skip it in my last order to try something else. Mistake. I noticed a change in my skin within a couple days. I repurchased pretty quickly after that. Guess it’s a must have for me now. 4 stars because $28 is more than I would usually spend on one item that I need to repurchase monthly (but it’s not a total deal breaker obviously),1.0

I dont have combo skin but this settled in quickly and within an hour my skin felt just as it did before putting it on- oily in my tzone and dry around the rest. plus side, there wasn’t really any scent. back to the drawing board!",0.0
I wanted to love this but made my face super sticky and made me break out. Not for people with sensitive skin,0.0

I have fair skin, ordered the dark glow and it provided a nice color to my face but not as dark as I’d hoped and not long lasting.  $30 a little bottle, it’s not worth it to me.  If money no object, go for it.  I’ll probably purchase again if a sale.  BUT, results marginal and can’t justify the cost.",0.0

"I love the product itself, however, there’s really not a lot of product. I ran out in just 4 months (using it every day). My 50ml creams usually last way longer than that! I think the pump gives you a bit too much, so you run out faster. For the price, you can get another cream that does the same job and lasts you longer.",0.0
"I really wanted to like this product. I gave it a serious try. First off, I didn’t really like the watery consistency. It has the word “cream” in the description, but I found nothing creamy about it. But my biggest issue was that it causes my sling to break out—a lot. I haven’t had acne like this since I was a teenager, and no face product I’ve ever used has done this to me. When I stopped using it for a couple of days, my skin cleared right up. I used it again, and the next day I was broken out again. It pains me to throw this away, but it’s in the trash.",0.0
Can’t say this is any better than baking soda for a gentle scruffing.,0.0
"This face wash is true to its name! It gets very frothy which is great if you like having a ‘sudsy’ face when washing. I also use an exfoliating brush and it goes on very smooth and helps me feel like I’m giving myself a deep clean. After rinsing, it left my face feeling cool and very clean. It’s almost like mouthwash for your face in that it leaves you feeling cool and refreshed! So far, so good! I’d definitely recommend to anyone as I have fairly sensitive skin and it hasn’t made me break out or become dry or oily. A little goes a long way as well, so I foresee this bottle lasting me a while which is great for the price.",1.0
This product is amazing. Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and clean. Helps with acne SO much,1.0
"Smells lightly like sunscreen. Very liquidy, has a consistency of baking soda paste and is applied the same way. When rubbed it turns into little balls of the product. Brightens beautifully, skin smooth, and hydrates. Also I think it removed the dead skin cells and dirt. I like, but wouldn’t buy again.",1.0
Buying my 2nd bottle. Best product. It did go fast. Maybe that’s cuz i love it. LoL. And I love that it has Royal Jelly in it. Smell is so soft but satisfying. Light honey goodness.,1.0
I bought this spray thinking I could use this on top of my makeup throughout the day but nopeee It left my face so oily and messed with my foundation that I had to retouch my make-up again. I really hope it works or somehow so I use the spray before doing my makeup as a toner but it still left my face with sticky oily-ish feeling! Definitely not a fan! Will return!,0.0
I wanted to love this product. A lot of the YouTubers that I watch rave about this product but I wasn’t impressed. It did an ok job of taking my makeup off. A $7 bottle of micellar water does a better job. But if you like using an oil based makeup remover then stick to coconut oil. It’s a fraction of the cost.,0.0
"I got a sample first and loved it. Then I bought the larger, full size. At first this product definitely worked; my skin was softer, fine lines were smoother, and it moisturized well. But over time as I continued to use it I no longer saw the same results. It’s a great product but I think the formula breaks down before you can get through a whole bottle.",0.0
It wasn’t worth my $18 in my opinion. This product just didn’t wow me at all.  I would rather buy ecos at the drug store. But this lip balm works well underneath your lipstick. That’s the only plus,0.0
I did not like this product at all. It went on goopy and oily. My foundation separated. I also couldn’t wear it alone as it really only made me look oily vs counteracting my redness.,0.0
"Now only are these over priced, they also didn’t do anything at all. I would say, save your money and get the drugstore ones.",0.0
I’d heard a lot about this product but was held back because of the $$$ but I bought a travel size of this and the cleanser and i was absolutely blown away. I have oily to combination skin and it is light enough to not be overly oily but moisturizing enough for my normal to dry areas. I am shooketh! I will spend the paper to buy this product again and again. I might even try other products. I have been made into a believer.,1.0
"I decided to purchase this peeling solution after reading the reviews here, I absolutely love it I’ve only used it two times and I have not had any new pimples so far I am hoping this will help with the blackheads i have on my nose. So far so good.",1.0
i got a small size sample of the dr. jart+ cicapair tiger glass color correcting treatment from influenster to try and have to admit i’m very impressed. i use a small amount as a spot treatment to help reduce the look of redness especially around my nose and to help cover some acne and breakouts and it does the trick. i’ve used it under makeup as well as bare faced and it does a great job providing coverage where needed. i use a small amount at a time and dab it on spots where i need it and build up a little bit a time so i still have a very natural finish. i’ve already bought one to use on the daily.,1.0
"Not worth the hype, number one. But it’s not a terrible product. Just not the OMG I thought it’d be. It’s a nice lip product. Not much better than a 5 dollar drug store tube or Vaseline. Nice during the day too.",0.0
"SHISEIDO Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream is a phenomenal eye cream. I wanted to give myself sometime to use the product and write a review that had some credibility. I’ve been using this daily, at night during my facial routine for the last 3 weeks and I see a difference. I noticed that the skin around my eyes looks supple, bright, and minimized the appearance of fine lines under my eyes. I also tend to have dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep and it appears this eye cream has aslo helped with the appearance of dark circles. SHISEIDO Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream is definitely a beautiful and luxurious product. It has a mild scent and a smooth and gentle feel when applied on one of the most sensitive areas on your face, your eye area. A little goes along way . I also find that the inclusion of the little spatula is a fantastic idea to eliminate contamination. I notice more high end products tend to include little spatula/ spoons to retrieve product. Great idea. I recieved this product  complimentary for review purposes but I would definitely purchase it once I have used it all.",1.0
"I think this product is great for a specific type of person who really wants their skincare to be an experience. The packaging is gorgeous and it smells nice to create a nice immersive experience. You can get a cheaper, simpler fragrance free exfoliating toner if that’s more your thing or if you are sensitive, but I think Glow Recipe did a great job if this is the type of product you are looking for.",1.0
It’s definitely a great product that’s for sure.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump.  It doesn’t leave too bad of a sticky face either which is always nice.  The first few days I did not notice anything drastic but having used this for a few months now I’d say it works amazing wonders on the face.  If you are looking for a product that will deliver this is it.  The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is that it is pretty pricey.  But hey it works.  I am looking for a cheaper alternative though because this is so spendy and also gets used up quickly as well and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t use this product daily.,1.0
I had a fear of getting red and sensitive or even breaking out from retinol products in general.   I know that not all retinol’s are created or bottled the same.   This one from drunk elephant was a relief and is delightful to use. I started it simply one night on the first week and then built from there. The second week I applied it two nights and the 3rd week I started every other night.  I either mix with my Hydrating serum or apply after. My skin is responding well if I apply on damp skin or mixed with a serum.,1.0
"I went out with my friends a few weeks ago and simultaneously used this sample for the first time to test it out. It felt nice going on and has a pleasant scent to it. It smoothed out my skin and left it feeling fresh. My foundation (Nars) went on fine, along with the rest of my makeup. After hours of being out, my makeup was still on and looked fine. Overall a good product, but still unsure if I would purchase the full size. I received a sample size of this product from Influenster for testing purposes, all views are my own.",1.0
"So sad about this cream. When I got the chance to finally try it, I broke out like crazy. I kept it up hoping it would subside and it only got worse. I guess I should be glad that this doesn’t work for me since the price is outrageous.",0.0
"God, now I regret buying it. Took me so long to decide and now I just regret it so badly. I wanted to like this but I guess it’s just not for my skin. I have dry patches all over my face now after I managed to get my skin hydrated again after a cold front we had in NYC. I’m giving it 3 stars cause let’s be honest, people like it and I’ve seen great results on my friends skin, but it’s just not for me. I’m returning the product after using it twice cause I’m afraid I will pill off my entire skin with this. Cute packaging, great concept. Not what I was expecting.",0.0
does not moisturize at all,0.0
"This product has a lot of hype surrounding, and I was hesitant to purchase since I’m a die-hard skincare addict with an affinity for thick moisturizers (think Clinique moisture surge or Belif’s aqua bomb). Went into a Sephora Studio one day on a lunch break and bought it as a small impulse buy. Can’t say it’s wildly hydrating, but it is a nice pick-me-up. Probably won’t re-purchase, but I will enjoy using it up.",0.0
Didn’t care for it. It dries with a sticky texture and just doesn’t work as a day or nighttime cream. I got it as a free sample so whatever. I would never spend money on this one.,0.0

"I wanted to be able to use this, I have tried retinol products in the past and have found them too irritating. I used this one a week, mixed with the same amount of the hydrating serum provided, for 3 weeks and I just cannot get past the irritation and redness, my face hurts. I will be returning. It obviously works for some based on the reviews, just not for me.",0.0
"I started using this product two days ago and had a similar reaction to other people using this product.. my whole face broke out into little bumps. I do not have acne prone skin at all, I’m generally more dry than oil but this product messed my skin up! Would not recommend if you have any kind of skin sensitivity - especially for the price point.",0.0
"I really like this moisturizer, but I am not in love with it in the same way I have been with other Ole Henriksen products! My main complaint is that it is absolutely unwearable under my typical makeup products (it causes them to aggregate and not lie flat on the face), even though it is otherwise light enough to be a day-time moisturizer. I have to limit my use to night, and it is a little light for night time wear, especially in the winter. Some things about this moisturizer absolutely rock, though: the texture and smell are great, it absorbs fast but stays on throughout the night, and it does have both an immediate and long-lasting brightening effect. I also have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me at all despite the potent vitamin C.I’m really torn on whether or not to purchase this again since it has a pretty fair balance of pros/cons.",1.0
Pro: it actually does what it claims Cons: expensive- that’s it,1.0
"I have 1 week using the product and it is a total wonder, very easy to use and it looks very good on my face, and my pores have been reduced. The only thing I would recommend is the smell, I do not like it very much and it is a little sticky, it is the only thing what would I change.",1.0
This stuff works and is great BUT. I can’t get over the feeling of it on my skin and the coffee like smell and don’t want to sleep with it and don’t want it to get on my pillow.,0.0
I received this in the Sephora Favorites Sparkly Clean Makeup set. It has this weird fermented smell. I wouldn’t have minded but I don’t think it does anything special. Not worth the price tag. There are better moisturizers.,0.0
I love this product. It applies well and you don’t need much cover your face. It leaves your skin with such a nice glow (but without the sparkle look :)) I have fair skin and am able to use this without additional foundation or concealer coverage on skin. Its on more on the expensive side for me -- but I guess something this good comes at a cost.,1.0
"was very excited to try this, but it gave me acne everywhere :(",0.0
If you want a ‘deep cleanser’ and have sensitive skin this is a great product for you. BUT if you have oily/comb tough skin like me this product is too gentle. I don’t feel it removed dead skin and I could barely feel the granules.,0.0
"I was really excited about this product but don’t love it. I have combination skin. This product seems to just sit on the surface of my skin and bring attention to any dry spots that I have that day. I’m also very fair skinned and while the cream does turn from green to beige, my skin still had a slight green hue. I like the Erborian BB cream MUCH better.",0.0
"Love this cleanser. Removes all makeup. Leaves skin feeling clean, sift and hydrated.",1.0
"Honestly this is still the top cleanser for me for removing any and all traces of leftover makeup, dirt, oil, anything. I don’t even have the slightest mascara left under my eyes with this. I have dry skin and this doesn’t seem to bother it or dry it out even more. I like that I can’t count on it to remove everything. I don’t really feel it does much in the way of blackheads and acne but I don’t think it’s really aimed for that anyway. I think I’ll implement a salicylic toner or something for that. But everything else this cleanser is great for. A little goes a really long way as well so one bottle lasts a long time and I use this day and night.",1.0
I needed something to control my oiliness and unfortunately this made my T-Zone soooo oily and shiny. But two stars for consistency and no distinct smell.,0.0
"Although it works well, I am not sure how much I care for it. It is a small bottle, only 1 Fl Oz. It is very thin and runny, so easy to spill or not use effectively. 42 SPF is ok, but not great. Would probably not buy it regularly.",0.0

"This broke me out in tiny, itchy bumps all over my forehead. I don’t have sensitive skin and it’s very rare a new product causes a bad reaction. It took off my makeup just fine, but obviously wasn’t worth it for me.",0.0

"This is definitely the worst non foaming cleanser I’ve ever used. It dried my skin out and caused a terrible acne breakout. It also separates if it sits for more than a day.Even if it’s just 8 bucks, save yourself the money and just buy The Ordinary.",0.0
I love and trust everything from this line. I’d never used rose hip seed oil before so when i saw this I decided to give it a go. I was worried it may break me out. It did not disappoint in anyway. This entire line has totally changed my skin. I haven’t even had the smallest blemish since. Truly. I threw everything I used to use out and only use this line.,1.0
"I am really impressed with this eye stick! It’s so easy to use, no mess, and you can use it any time. I put it on in the morning and at night and even reapply over my thin makeup at least once a day. Though it’s meant to be for your eyes, I use it all over my face and even my lips! I also love that it’s cruelty free and vegan, which is actually really important to me. Great price and a really good product that will now become a regular part of my skin routine!",1.0
"It smells good, but I don’t get the hype. Doesn’t fully remove my makeup or cleanse my face, but doesn’t irritate it either. It’s a good cleanser, but not for the price point.",1.0
"I don’t see nothing special in this cream, compared to the high value that you pay, I don’t think that’s worth. The product it is ok, the consistency is creamy, it make your skin more moist but nothing crazy!",0.0
"This is expensive... and worth every penny. I have sensitive, combination, acne prone skin and have never found a good exfoliator that didn’t hurt and/or dry my skin out. But this one is just right. They are not lying that it can be used every day. I use mine about 4-5 times a week and have had my jar for about 3 months so far -- I don’t even think I’m halfway through it yet.",1.0

"As someone who has struggled with acne for a long time, I noticed this cleanser made a huge difference once I added it to my routine. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean, but not stripped (you know, that dry feeling) like so many have before.",1.0
I was looking for a product to gently exfoliate my sensitive skin that wasn’t a physical exfoliant like a scrub or too intense like a peeling gel. This has been working perfectly. I feel like using them everyday has helped my skin texture a lot and I never have dry patches in my foundation anymore (my other products help with that too tho so I can’t give this all the credit),1.0
I have fair combination skin - Oily around the T zone and occasional breakouts around the cheek and chin. I put this on after cleansing my face for two nights and I broke out! Never had the worst breakout since ole hindirson vitamin C product. I immediately stopped and used the Argan Oil by Jose Maran and it calmed my skin down. I had to return this. I had a bad reaction - make sure if you have sensitive skin that you monitor and stop using right away!,0.0

I looooove this got it as a sample today I can’t wait to buy it. Smells exactly like the natural ingredients which smell aaaaamazing and that’s so important to me because I’m such a smell person. It’s gotta smell good and fresh not like rear end. Super hydrating leaves skin feeling supple.,1.0
I received this complimentary of Influenster and I’ve always wanted to try it. I have super sensitive skin so I have a hard time purchasing high end products without be skeptical of wasting my money. I’m pleased to say it is amazing! I definitely will be repurchasing this. My skin is so dry and this has definitely helped out!,1.0
"I purchased this cleanser after a Sephora employee recommended it to me. I have combo skin with the occasional hormonal breakouts. Although it’s great at removing dirt & make-up, it hasn’t done anything for my acne. If anything it’s only clogging my pores since I’ve noticed that I have a lot more whiteheads AND blackheads ever since I’ve started using this. I would not purchase it again.",0.0
"Does exactly what it’s supposed to do and really good for days when you’re not wearing makeup but need *something*. That being said...I’ve never used another product that has irritated my skin so badly. I used it two different times, several days apart, and my skin became very red and I broke out with 4 zits over night. Disappointing because I would’ve really loved this.",0.0
I wanted to love this so much because I have always heard that Vitamin C is a great antioxidant and Vitamin E is so moisturizing . Unfortunately this severely broke me out. I have been using Tretinoin (prescription Retin-A) for a year now so I usually only get one pimple around me chin on my period and it goes away quickly but this gave me 5-6 pimples that hurt and will be leaving scars :/// The ingredients list has many many oily ingredients before Vitamin C & E so please be careful if you have acne prone skin!!,0.0
"Radiance! I love Babyfacial for so many reasons. Product is probably a bit much for sensitive skin types. My skin is well versed in products such as these so I tolerated without issues. Initial tingle for a couple minutes followed by no discomfort. My skin is radiant, clear, soft, and beautiful following. For reference: combo skin that is used to superficial peels, acids, use mid dose Retin-A with no retinization period at start-up. My skin is NOT sensitive! You may have a different experience?

I LOVE THIS FACE WASH!!! I used to have really bad tiny pimples all over my face and my pores were super visible. I’ve been using this product for about 6 months now and my skin has never looked better.

"My skin decided to erupt in 50/50 hormonal and cystic acne recently. I have Peter Thomas Rothe cleanser and it didn’t make a dent- just made the tops a bit dry and flaky.  THIS stuff brought down the swelling dramatically, decreased the flare ups, makes the zits go away QUICKLY, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft rather than dried out and stretched tight. Highly recommending it!",1.0

"It’s just ok.  I like D.E. products (their lip balm is lovely), but my eyes do not look any better or worse than when I use another cream.  You get a lot for your money, but only 3 stars because my sensitive, dry eyes did not get much relief with this.",0.0
I found this product was semi moisturizing. I didn’t find it did anything for me over night. I found it was good for a couple hours and then you would have to re-apply. I did get this product complimentary.,1.0
I love this face cream because it’s not thick on my skin and it lasts all day long. However I didn’t and don’t use it when I have pimples on my face because I noticed that it helps the pimple grow if that makes sense,1.0

"I tried this serum out as directed for over a week. I thought the formula was lovely and felt great on the skin. The ingredients also seemed to be high quality. The reason for an average rating is that I didn’t see a considerable difference in my pore size or skin texture. It’s possible that if I were to use it longer it might show some differences over time. Ultimately, however, I felt that the price point didn’t warrant the results I was seeing. I didn’t see any negative effects to my skin from the formulation and I have rather sensitive skin. I can see people being happy with this product but I just didn’t think the results were worth the money from my point of view. There are cheaper products that have similar ingredients and promises of minimizing pores.",0.0

Glad I got it as part of a set, but I don’t wear make up enough to buy this on it’s own. Will be interested to see how this does against eye makeup",1.0

Really wanted to love this. After getting it in a sample size i decided to purchase the 18 dollar one. Terrible for dry skin it just flakes and doesnt fully absorb into the skin. Also if your face has a little hair or something on it it will clump under the hairs. Will not be purchasing again,0.0
It feels very hydrating when I put it on at night. However my skin still feels dry when I wake up and I have not noticed a difference overall. Glad I got the small size to try first instead of investing a lot of money into something that does not work.,0.0

"This is my go to moisturizer. I’ve gone through at least 4 jars already and I have 2 more backups in my makeup kit. It’s a simple, solid product. I have dry skin that’s extremely sensitive and acne prone and this helps hydrate all day without breaking me out. I have tried MANY “basic” moisturizers and none of them last as long or have results as good as this one. The formula is a lot like First Aid Beauty’s moisturizer but is way less heavy. It’s also way thicker than the yellow bottle of moisturizer from Clinique which I thought was way too thin and greasy and would constantly break me out. This is definitely a holy grail product, it’s like a high end Cetaphil and the price isn’t bad considering this jar lasts me about 2-3 months.",1.0
"I really didn’t want to like this cotton. I didn’t want to be that girl that needs $10 cotton because the pharmacy brands just won’t do; but my God! This is the best cotton you’ll ever use. It’s heavenly soft, isn’t too thick or too thin, does the job with just one square. You can also cut them in half to apply different products. Bottom line, yes, this cotton is worth the price. I’ve seen dupes out there for this, but they don’t hold a candle to this one. Try the smaller pack if you don’t want to commit to the bigger size.",1.0
"This product irritated my skin and caused me to breakout. I liked the fact that the product was clear and had no cast, especially since I have darker skin (and it’s hard to find a sunscreen without cast). But unfortunately it wasn’t a match for me since I have sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin/oily skin, I wouldn’t recommend this product.",0.0
The balm helps remove makeup easily and doesn’t tug at the skin! It doesn’t leave an oily caste after removing but doesn’t dry out my skin after! Def recommend!,1.0
When ordering this product I was so excited. After applying this product it dried my skin and start peeling off. I was feeling like my skin burning a little. It didn’t work for me. I am about return it. I do not recommend it,0.0
"Has a nice scent. A cool green color that color corrected any redness I had on my cheeks. It felt nice on my skin, and I only needed to use a little bit to achieve an even skin tone color. One of my new products for a day where I want to wear less makeup!",1.0
This was very moisturizing and a good consistency. I received this for free but I will definitely be buying it.,1.0
Returned after 4 days. Caused extreme redness and dryness and made my lines look worse.  Accentuated my bags. I’ve been using retinol products for years and never had a problem before.,0.0

"I’m in love with the magic cream! I’ve heard so many good things about it on tiktok, so I was glad I received a sample to try! I apply it before I do my makeup for a better overall look. It doesn’t mess up my application and makes my skin feel so much better.",1.0
Used this sunscreen today and love the extra hydration and glow it provided. Didn’t leave a white cast and blended in easily. My makeup also applied nicely on top without any piling like some sunscreens do! Will be repurchasing!,1.0
"I was given this product to try FREE from Goop in exchange for my review. That being said, I really love how this makes my face feel. It sloughed off my dead skin well. I’m prone to being extra dry in the winter and this was exactly what I needed. It has a nice scent, and after rinsing the scrub away leaves my face feeling moisturized and smooth. It didn’t dry my skin out at all.",1.0
"I was on the fence about trying this and decided to just go for it. I do not have sensitive skin and I’m not new to exfoliating products or glycolic acid but this has SO much added fragrance. Don’t get me wrong, this smells amazing but added fragrance in skincare literally serves no purpose and can cause irritation to a lot of skin types. I did love how smooth this made my skin but within days I had whiteheads popping up everywhere and they completely went away once I stopped using this product. Without the added fragrance I think this would be an awesome toner!",0.0
"Received the free sample of this. it smells nothing like strawberries, but was a chemical medicine-y smell instead.it irritated my skin and was an overall bad experience. I can not reccomend.",0.0
"I was really looking forward to trying this cleanser. I like a few products from this brand and reviews for this cleanser were good. This product is very fragranced, my skin is sensitive to fragrance and with this face wash I got a bit of an irritation. Really wanted to love this, but heavily fragranced/irritating. When I looked at the ingredients list I was surprised to find fragrance in the middle of the list as typically it is last or one of the last items on most skin care items.",0.0
I haven’t had a single break out since switching to this cleanser 6 months ago. I use daily and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or tight. I have combination skin and have been searching forever for a cleanser that doesn’t irritate my skin while delivering tangible results. This cleanser is my secret skincare weapon!,1.0
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I love and hate this product. I love it cause when I used it that 1 time it was really moisturizing and my skin felt amazing. I hate it cause of all the fragrance it has in it and it broke me out. my skin is very sensitive to anything that has fragrance.,0.0
"This creme definitely has some strong anti aging ingredients, which means now might be a good time to add it to my routine. It is moisturizing,though not as thick as some I have tried. It has a very mild scent and isn’t sticky. A little bit goes a long way so I think this container will last a long time.",1.0
Love the smell and overall purpose of the product! Will definitely use again!,1.0
"I’ve always had large pores, so when I got sent this product for testing purposes I got really excited! As you can see from the attached photos, my pores stayed about the same size. There was no noticeable difference and my face also got red and irritated after use. The redness I expected, but I was super disappointed with the lack of “instant facial results“. On the plus side, my face feels really soft now. Not Ole’s best product.",0.0
"This stuff is incredible! I have pretty sensitive skin, so trying new products can be tough and lead to breakouts, but not with ADMC! I have had an absolutely great experience with this product! It goes on so smooth and gives my skin the instant moisture that it craves. On top of that, the benefits continue over night, so when I wake up, my skin still has the dewy glow.",1.0
The packaging is nice. A sleek and compact easy to travel. I like the scent. It has a citrusy smell which I love. It did a great job in moisturizing the skin. However I didn’t notice it helped my skin texture.,1.0
Saved my face before my birthday! I used this product literally 4 days before my birthday and I saw significant results. The past month of work has been really stressful and I noticed I had congested skin. My skin was becoming bumpy and the texture was looking like a mess. I used this product once in the day and once at night and within 4 days my face was noticeably smoother and brighter. It wiped away my dead skin and renewed the texture. My makeup looked flawless that night. Definitely recommend this product.,1.0
"Waste of money. This did nothing for me. I applied a “generous“ amount as suggested, and I still wake up with dry, cracked lips, even after giving this a couple weeks. I wish I could return this.",0.0
Just wasn’t for me. Didn’t like the smell and did not really see a cleansed result. Also the product separated after only like three uses which was just not for me.,0.0
I got this as a sample size to try and I absolutely love it! I love that it doesn’t got on or feel oily. It’s so smooth to put on. I will be putting this into my skin care routine.,1.0
Great moisturizer!! I am one of those people that never liked how tacky and oily some moisturizers left my face. This cream instead makes my face feel hydrated from within not just wet on top. After a few hours of application my skin feels so healthy and rejuvenated and I couldn’t be happier with the results I’ve gotten from this cream!,1.0
Great product. Good for oily skin. Not heavy but also not so light it feels ineffective. I have bought a full size after trying a sample.,1.0
Was so excited to try this product only used it for 2 days and it made my skin red and have little bumps on my cheeks and chin and I do not have acne prone skin,0.0
". first of all, this smells amazing- it’s like a cactus watermelon mixed drink almost. so using it is definitely super fun, it also has a cool consistency. it helps for me to use this 2x a week to exfoliate - makes the skin smoooooth!",1.0
I received a sample of this and used it today. All I can say is wow! My skin was super dry and now it’s glowy and moisturized. My skin looks amazing. I also love Green Clean by Farmacy.￼,1.0
"I love the smell of this cleanser so much. It is my favorite thing about it! As far as loving the cleanser as a cleanser, I do enjoy the creamy feel and the fact that my skin feels truly clean after using this product. I have dry skin, and this cleanser (along with every other cleanser on the planet) leaves my skin feeling slightly tight. After moisturizing, my skin feels great. I would recommend this cleanser to my friends!",1.0
"I have sensitive skin and the minimal ingredients and zero fragrance have caused no breakouts. I’ve been using this product in conjunction with the inkey list polyglutamic acid for about six months. Though I don’t want to mislead you into thinking this is an overnight miracle, I have seen improvements in the texture of my skin and it the tightness of my skin. It’s an amazing product and the price point is just phenomenal.",1.0
"I’ve wanted to try this product since it came out and I finally got around to purchasing it during Sephora’s quarterly sale. I used in the evening and the following day I had breakouts everywhere. The reason I didn’t initially purchase is I thought the concept was odd. Marketing a mask but a mask that does not wash off/can always be worn as a primer. Like, is that even a mask though? Or is this a lotion? Regardless, my instincts were correct because this product just sits on your skin and clogs your pores.",0.0
I really love that this eye cream has a pump! I hate having to dip my finger or even use a little spatula (because it always ends up getting lost or falling) so this is great for me! It’s very moisturizing and I feel like I can already tell a difference. I use this eye cream in the morning and I feel like it de puffs my eyes almost instantly. The only thing I’m not a fan of is the price but eye creams are usually expensive.,1.0
"I have been looking into getting a vitamin c product for some time. The DE C-Firma appealed to me as its ingredients are clean. Unfortunately I find that I get blackheads when using this, though at least it’s not causing me to break out. In addition, there is a somewhat rancid-like smell to this from day one when you first mix it together. I tried wearing it everyday for a week. The smell wasn’t a dealbreaker, however the blackheads were and I will be returning. In terms of lightening dark spots, this seems to do that very well. I noticed any spots I had faded a fair bit after wearing this for approximately 8 hours during the day.",0.0
I use this twice daily after cleansing. I love how it makes my skin feel so soft and look radiant. I swear I can tell the difference if I skip using this! It’s a permanent staple in my skincare routine.,1.0
"I received this product for free from Influenster.After trying this product for 2 weeks, I was definitely unimpressed. For a product of this brand and price range I was really expecting better results! It does smell wonderful, like oranges! But it made my already oily skin suuuuper greasy, it almost felt like it left a film on my face. I didn’t notice any brightening or difference in the appearance of my skin either. Total let down!",0.0
"I’m not going to downplay The Ordinary Products but if you don’t have indepth knowledge of skincare nor are you a skincare nerds I’ll not even advice anyone to go for it. I’ve tried so many The Ordinary products such as Hyaluronic acid, Rose Hip seed oil, Peeling Solution & so many more and in all this I only can say one thing for everything, they all made me breakout in places I’ve never seen before, acne and different sort of blemishes became a friend I never knew my face could have and my skin is not even sensitive nor oily, it ranges from normal to dry base on the weather. Most people don’t belive this but as an adult I’ve neither had acne nor any sort of blemish all my life and I’ve used so many products but none has ever dealt with me the way the ordinary does. While using it I wasn’t particularly doing mix and match but I won’t claim that I’m %100 sure that I did everything ok. I’m aware that The Ordinary product are quite affordable which was what lead me to it initially but I won’t be purchasing anything from this Brand anymore in the future. I’m fighting everyday to clear the breakouts and acne caused by this brand products till now with other methods although slow but its pretty much effective. For those that this works for I’m truly jealous of you guys but for me its au revoir (hope we never meet again).",0.0
"For the price and the praise that the sales associate gave this product i was over all disappointed. I enjoyed the feeling of the “jelly“ consistency, but it took a while to clean my face. I usually had to wash my face twice to remove my mascara (I use the Tarte gifted - not waterproof). I also don’t wear foundation only concealer and this couldn’t manage to remove even the lightest layer of concealer. My breakout continued and I even started noticing more black heads on my nose... I wont be repurchasing or recommending this product. Save you’re money.",0.0

I was excited to try this as I have extremely dry skin and Kiehl’s discontinued my previous go to but this face cream was terrible. it pilled on my skin even if I just put it on by itself with no retinol /serum and no matter how long I waited before doing my makeup. I thought it might just be a night cream for me but it wasn’t even that moisturizing.,0.0
Love this cleanser it removes makeup and balance your skin. Fresh is easy to use and you miss it when you forget to pack in your bag.,1.0
"This cleanser is GREAT!!! Love that it’s vegan, cruelty free and explains what each ingredient promotes. Lathers really well so a little goes a long way; while rinsing you can feel it’s leaving your skin texture soft and smooth. Have been using for about a month now and really keeps my skin in check; barely any break outs in my usual areas; leaving a natural glow! I have sensitive skin (with almost all cleaners drying out my skin), this is very gentle.. I recommend all the time!!",1.0
"I have normal, nonsensitive skin, in my late twenties, above average skin saavy. I was looking for a vitamin C or anti-aging serum and bought this after a Sephora employee highly recommend this to me. I honestly have mixed feelings about it. So I have pretty unblemished Asian skin. I finished this bottle, but don’t feel like I saw a dramatic difference. Disclaimer, I didn’t do a before and after photo so of course, it may be that I had too high expectations (after all this costs a lot, and the employee did hype it a lot). But I’ve definitely seen more satisfying results from using Vitamin C. If you want to see results on your skin, this might not be for you. Or maybe just not for people in their twenties or people who already have pretty unblemished skin. I would give three stars, but given how expensive it is and the alternatives out there, giving two. If you do buy, they occasionally have value deals where they sell the full-size serum along with a toner and other Caudalie item for the same price as just the serum. Would recommend you buy it then. I bought it then and also got the Essence and  some Glycolic Acid Cream thing.",0.0
This is ok. Not worth the hype it gets. It’s nice when it goes on and I love the little spatula that it comes with but it doesn’t keep my lips moisturized all throughout the night. In the morning my lips are back to normal/dry. I much prefer the Agave lip mask- that is worth every penny and keeps my lips supple and moisturized all day and night.,0.0

"I’ve had a sample of this gel cream before and remember liking it. I went to Sephora to pick up some marine hyaluronics by TO as I ran out but they only sell it online so I grabbed this instead. It was about $80 and highly recommended. I tried it every day for about a week and a half and although I enjoyed the texture and application, it didn’t hold up throughout the day. My skin flaked all that week and I will be returning what I have left because it was not cheap. I’ll happily be going back to my TO marine hyaluronics at a fraction of the price!",0.0
I bought this and was very thrown off by size but a little goes a long way I was expecting a fully tan face but it just leaves a nice dewy bronze finish and I have acne prone skin and it’s makes it look bump free I mix 3 small drops with my ordinary moisturizer and I’m absolutely hoooked best product their is no other product I’d rather have annnnnd it’s good for ur skin I’m just in love buy it. I swear it wont disappoint !,1.0
"Absolutely spectacular, it leaves my skin soft and firm. It has a fantastic scent. Since I use it I don’t want to try anything else, it works fantastic, too well, I’m super happy with my purchase and I recommend it 100%. Since I’m half way through I’m going to order the next one.",1.0
"I have oily, acne prone, texturized skin. This clear, gel like serum goes on very smoothly and absorbs wonderfully into your skin. It leaves your skin exfoliated, brightened, hydrated, and unclogged. It is made with AHA, BHA, and a raspberry fruit extract. I’ve really enjoyed using this, it has helped so much with fine lines, congestion, wrinkles, pores, and overall brightness. Highly recommend!!!",1.0
It’s a little drying for me personally. Good cleanser but drying,0.0
"Unfortunately, I did not notice a dang difference. Which totally sucks, because it had soo many good reviews and was pretty expensive. I mean, everyones skin is different, so give it a go! But I have very acne prone skin and tried this out and my skin stayed exactly the same. Dropped a ton of money for nothing.",0.0

"I love DE and am a loyal Lala Retro user so I decided to try this, but it broke me out like nothing I’ve tried in YEARS. Without changing anything else in my routine, I gave this a good 2 weeks but my skin got to a point where I just needed to stop. Ultimately I returned it and re-upped on the Lala Retro. Since the Sephora birthday gift was DE this year, I opted to get it and give this moisturizer another shot. My forehead was covered in tiny bumps after 1 use. It obviously works great for many, but not myself.",0.0
I absolutely love this sunscreen. I wear sunscreen on my face daily this product went on easy and smooth no burning no irritations. I love that this product has added benefits for the health of my face. it absorbed fast and I was able to apply my daily blush within minutes. so the size if the product I would say the price is a little high but sometimes good products cost a little more.,1.0

"The Innisfree Super Volcanic Clusters Pore Clearing Clay Mask is easy and fun to use. The jar’s lid is easy to twist open and then to twist close again. I just used two fingers to scoop put the clay mask and then apply. My t-zone is my oiliest, so I just applied it to my forehead, nose and chin. There is a pleasant cooling sensation, which was just the perfect amount for me. After the mask dried, I easily rinsed it off with lukewarm water. As with any skincare new to you, I recommend testing just a small section of your skin first to make sure you do not have any negative reaction. This product gifted to me by Innisfree.",1.0
This really does make my skin GLOW. It did burn a little bit the first time I used it so I recommend starting with one pump until your skin gets used to it!,1.0

"OK I can FINALLY write an honest review. I bought this on July 3rd. And applied this every night. Of course no one is perfect, so I might’ve missed a few days here and there but all in all, I was very consistent with nightly application. No real results. I have bad acne scars, dark spots, hyper pigmentation. I’m 31 years old and still get hormonal breakouts on my forehead, side of the nose and chin. I was so excited to try this based off all the reviews I read about their incredible results. Personally for me, nothing has changed. I did not see a drastic difference of my dark spots going away.But I will say, the price is good. I dont know why people think $30 for a clean toner is expensive... I still have a little left! And its been 6 months! But overall, I do not recommend.",0.0
Loved itI’ve used OH products before and this was nice but not great. I got this complimentary from influenster but had been looking for a similar product. It worked minutely and I loved the smell.,1.0
"What is good about this product: SPF, Tiger Grass, oil-absorption. This is a great base layer if you have oily skin, it makes a good primer and is very calming.What is not good about this product: It settles into every pore and is visible. I had little white dots all over my face.This seems to be a good product for oily skin, as it provides a soothing, oil-absorbing base layer, but since most people with oily skin also have larger pores it is probably not a complete win. I worry about the long term effects of it settling into my pores and perhaps making them worse over time. That being said, if you put foundation over it for special occasions it helps with staying power and oil control. I am happier with this as a date night product rather than a daily product. Which is what I had hoped it would be.If you have larger pores I would still recommend the line, just not this product. Instead get the Tiger Grass Serum, it is amazing.",0.0
The only eye cream I love and use. I’ve used other eye creams before from Sephora. When I don’t use this cream under my eyes at night I feel very dry. Nothing compares to this. Will repurchase over and over again!,1.0

"This does the trick and does remove most or almost all the makeup. The eye area can be a little tricky, I still prefer eye make up remover to get rid of what was not removed with this balm.The downside is that this formula is just so drying. I’ve used it on trips due to the convenice of not having to worry about liquids in my carry on, but when you remove it, the next day my skin felt so flaky and dry. It takes forever just trying to restore the hydration back into my skin. Would recommend more oil based cleansers that come in the pump for sensitive or dry skin.",0.0

It smells a little bit like watermelon, but not too strong. I wished this was just a serum though, because the skincare benefits doesn’t matter now that it’s a highlighter.",0.0
"I have been coming back for this product over and over again. I wouldn’t say its the bet primer ever, but its. great first step for moisturizing BEFORE putting your make-up on.

Rinsing it off takes forever and leaves a greasy residue, requiring another cleanse with a different cleanser. I will not reorder.",0.0
Good toners are hard to find but this one truly is one of them. It offers the skin a mild exfoliation while reducing the visibility of pores instantly. The consistency is between a toner and a serum. You can apply it with your hands or a cotton round (pls be reusable). It has worked wonders for me.,1.0
"SO happy I purchased this toner. I use it every other night after I wash my face. Has a nice mild citrusy scent. My acne scars have faded and no more breakouts! If I see a pimple forming, I apply some of this toner over it and it shrinks. I was worried this might make my skin dry in the winter time, but with daily moisturizing its completely fine! I’ve received comments about how smooth and glowy my skin looks and I credit this product. Also helps my makeup go on so much smoother. On my second bottle! Will definitely repurchase.",1.0
"My holy grail. My go-to, my right hand.I have gone through several moisturizers that I loved but always something missing. I can’t even BELIF this exists, it is so so good. My skin stays feeling moisturized after I put it on, whereas most dry up a tad bit after a few hours.",1.0

This crime has a very pungent smell that bothers me. That’s the primary reason for the low stars. I also prefer my face creams to have spf and this has none so that’s another thing against this. I did like the consistency of it.,0.0
I don’t see the hype or why it is so expensive. I would pass on this. It gets foamy and the bottle is glass so if it breaks in the shower I’m sure that would be a disaster.,0.0

"I really wanted to love this product, but sadly it didn’t work. It did feel like it tightened the skin, but definitely not enough to make any type of difference. It also felt like it left a thin layer of film on my skin. Wasn’t a big fan of thatThe product didn’t feel particularly moisturizing on my skin eitherOn the plus side, it wasn’t that expensive and didn’t hurt my feelings too much finding that the product didn’t work",0.0
UNREAL! So moisturizing and smells amazing. The consistency is great because it’s not too goopy but also thick enough to lock in moisture for hours and hours! Obsessed and will definitely buy it once my free sample that Influenster sent me is gone!,1.0
"After trying the bareMinerals Skinlongevity serum for the first time, I think it’s a lovely little serum. It’s very light and has a very thin texture that spreads easily. There is a herbal/floral scent to it but it doesn’t linger. It sinks in easily into the skin. I didn’t notice any negative reaction like burning. I’m excited to continue using this to hopefully see some long term results.",1.0

"Gifted by Dermalogica sampling. This product is a very gentle and you can be used in daily basis . This product’s formula is very unique. It’s come in a very fine white powder. you just add it to wet hands and rub your hands together, creating a paste and then massaged in circular motions over a freshly cleansed face. It’s so cool to see it turn from powder to paste just by rubbing with water! It feels so calming when I’m massaging the paste. It has a very faint scent of rice and oatmeal. After using this, my face feels very nice! It feels amazingly smooth and seamlessly polished.This product completely transformed my skin... it has helped with breakouts, hyperpigmention, oily skin and smoothing my overall complexion. I wish I’d had this stuff years ago.I recommend this product to anyone, young and old, who’s suffering with ance, breakouts, stubborn, dry patches or oily skin. I truly feel like everyone can benefit from product.",1.0
"I have been a loyal fan of Dior Crème de Rose for more than six years, despite the dent in my wallet. It’s pricey for a lip balm, but I was always disappointed with the cheaper options. Not anymore! Laneige’s Lip Sleeping Mask has a lovely berry smell (don’t worry, it doesn’t linger on the lips), a rich creamy consistency (not sticky, yesss!) and it is MUCH cheaper than Dior’s offering (consider that you’re getting .7oz versus Dior’s .25oz). It also comes with an adorable little spatula for those concerned about the pot being unsanitary! I don’t think I’ll go back to Dior. If you’re on the fence, try the mini version of this mask that comes in a set with the water sleeping mask--I’d recommend that product too. A total winner from an affordable brand!",1.0

"I’m extremely pale and the only color I turn is red. Every blemish and imperfection is red against a very white background lol. I use this before my tinted moisturizer and I think it definitely takes down the redness, plus it gives my tinted moisturizer a better finish!

I received a sample size of this product to sample over a weeks time! Unfortunately I didn’t see any difference in my skin in that time frame. It did give my skin hydration and moisture but as far as anything else goes I wasn’t impressed!,0.0

Does not work! I used this for over a month and it did nothing.. if anything I noticed more breakouts!,0.0
"I would give this product no stars if I could. It is extremely harsh and drying and NOT GOOD for sensitive skin at all! It made me break out for months and because of the reviews, I never thought it was the cleanser but as soon as I took it out of my routine, my skin cleared up completely. It irritates your eyes and your skin so the point where it starts flaking. Nothing that smells like detergent and burns your eyes to the point of watering can be good for you skin. Stick to CeraVe. This expensive product caused me to break out and left me with hyperpigmentation afterwards. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",0.0

Wanted to love this product because of the great reviews. However I prefer a stronger exfoliating scrub than this one. I used according to package but it didn’t seem to really do the job as much as I like because my skin is very dry and flaky from retinol. If you prefer a gentle exfoliate then this is for you.,0.0

"I’ve been using it for two weeks and I strongly dislike it. It lathers up so nicely, but the smell is disgusting and it’s way too stripping. I also have been breaking out after using this.

"okay so this product was so hyped up, and so many people claimed that it helped with their acne. tbh im not sure why, because it felt kind of greasy and smelled odd. I think it might have clogged my pores, but either way, it didn’t help my skin. not saying its a bad product; it just didn’t work for me. maybe if you had super super dry skin the results would show more. I believe this is also supposed to help with acne scars, so maybe I haven’t seen that aspect of it.",0.0
"I wanted so badly to love this product but it broke my skin out very badly- my whole face hurt after using this product. In addition, when I tried to return it for another product in-store six weeks after the original purchase date , I was refused. I had my original receipt, and 7/8th of the product remained. Now I’m stuck with this full product that I can’t use.",0.0
Didn’t break me out and it creates a lot of lather which is good but it washes off and leaves that squeaky feeling where my hands and water don’t slide across my face if that makes sense. So I’ll look for something else because I didn’t like that,0.0

"Gifted by Dermalogica. Received this at the perfect moment. My skin was having a breakout and the dermalogica daily Microfoliant has oatmeal which really helped calm my skin down. I opted to use this at nighttime since I use vitamin C in the morning. I like that it gave me that extra domination, calmed my skin. I was able to see a visibly brighter complexion by adding this to my routine.",1.0
Recently I received a sample of the Bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum from PINCHme I just loved the way this made my skin feel.,1.0
This us such surprising product. I recieved it in my first Influenster Box. I am really impressed with all of the products i recieved but this is my favorite because i love to keep my skin clean and soft. My face goes through so much different problems. I have lupus so i have a sunburn looking rash on cheeks and nose area and it’s called butterfly rash. I really love my skin routine. My routine is not every day but more like every 2 days. And especially if i decide to wear makeup. I used this product in the shower once and out of the shower. In the shower i did my face routines first. I have 3 products i use. Then i put my conditioner on and then this wonderful Goop Glow. I leave the conditioner on for 3 min just like this Goop Glow. While i am waiting i scrub my body with dove pomegranate body scrub. Then i rinse my hair and face off. I am telling when my skin feels so fresh and clean and sooo soft. It really does. I highly recommend this to anyone. The smell is a little off for me but the outcome is just so worth it.,1.0
"I’m pretty sad this didn’t work out for me. The ingredients are good, price is good, removes makeup but this stuff just won’t fully wash off. And because it won’t wash off completely, it clogged my pores and broke me out. For the price, id say try it. But if you have acne prone skin, maybe skip this one.",0.0
"does what it says. it reduces the appearance of textured acne, but for me personally i have noticed it leaves behind nasty acne scars. dark spots almost. it’s easier to let the blemish sit for a few days and have no dark spot once it’s gone. will not be re purchasing.",0.0

I have oily skin and not a lot of sunscreens work for me. I am also 41. This sunscreen is goopy and a lil goes a long way. I work 12 hours and am hardly in the sun so I don’t use sunscreen all too often. This sunscreen doesn’t make my skin more oily than normal but I don’t feel it’s does create extra texture that I don’t need. I had a better results with the coola and almost $50 for sunscreen I don’t think so,0.0
"I’m in my mid-30s and this was recommended to me by someone in their 20s who thought it was magical. I just don’t think it’s enough retinol to really make a difference on my skin, but I do like the color, smell, and texture (unlike a lot of other folks here). It didn’t cause any problems and I MAYBE have skin that’s a bit more smoother and even, but after three months of use, there’s not a real noticeable change for me.",0.0
"This advertises as a primer as well as a sunblack, so I thought this would be good for someone with oily skin.  However, everytime I have put on, I feel extremely oily by the end of the day versus when I put other sunscreens or no sunscreen on. I bought in the summer and thought it was due to my skin being more oily in the heat but I have recntl tried using it again and found it still makes my skin very oily.   I do not recommend this, it you have oily skin.",0.0
Very expensive for what it is. I still have to use a face wash after this product.,0.0
"i absolutely LOVE this product. it gives you the best glow right away, and feels great under sunscreen and foundation. it’s been a week or so and my skin seems brighter and more even. not to mention i seriously love feeling like a chemist mixing this together!! you know it’s as fresh as it can get. 10/10 alll day.",1.0
I have been buying this for years. The one expensive thing I find myself always buying after I run out. The most resent one I  purchased is not the same as all the others. It’s a shame. I think they’re going to lose a lot of loyal customers. with a product this expensive why mess with a good thing. I’ll be returning it.,0.0
Hydrates well if you put on double layers of it.   I don’t see any improvements on fine lines.,0.0

The product separated in the bottle. It just left my skin feeling greasy without removing my makeup at all.,0.0

"So did you know collagen molecules are too large to be absorbed through the skin?115 is a waste for this product I’m so grateful I did not pay for this I received a deluxe sized sample in my Sephora play box; this is straight up garbage.I guess technically I did pay for this sample so of course I used it, yeah like I figured it did nothing but leave my face looking like 15 year old boys, there was more grease on my face then the pizza my children ate for dinner last night.If that statement alone doesn’t cut it for you and your still considering buying this abomination. It’s extremely sticky and does not sink into the skin, not to mention the applicator is terrible and if you want to fight everyday for your snake oil then by all means.But if all that wasn’t enough the scent of the item is reminiscent of the 1990’s mixed with sadness and old people and gives you enough pimples to make you feel like your 14 again.The only person I would recommend this to is anyone with 115 to burn and need a crappy moisturizer even then I’d recommend they light it on fire then waste money on this product.",0.0
"This cleanser has strong smell. It is very overpowering. I was expecting a subtle tone of camellia like the rest of tatcha’s product line. I cannot stand the smell.However, texture wise, it is very creamy and turns to suds. I was indeed looking for this, and it feels moisturizing.Watch out if you have sensitive skin and get irritated with fragrance. This may not be for you.",0.0
"I love La Mer but this is probably the least impressive of their skincare products, which is almost a sacrilegious statement. I started using La Mer a decade ago because I have a much older cousin who looks insanely young and credits her fabulous skin to La Mer. This cream is very think and heavy. I would recommend it if you have severely dry skin, dry and/or irritated patches of skin from the elements or sensitized skin. I would also recommend this for mature skin. A little goes a very very long way. One small jar lasts for years so if you want to try it, start with a sample size. You will have plenty of time to see how you like it and how your skin reacts to it and won’t run the risk of larger sizes becoming expired. For me, this is much too heavy for daytime use and makes my normal to combination acne prone skin look greasy fast. I don’t think it wears nicely under makeup either. So I only use it at night. It’s a nice hydrating moisturizer, don’t get me wrong, but if I’m dropping this kind of money on skincare it’s going to be on a serum and not a moisturizer.",1.0
The wipes smell great but they’re so small it’s hard to take all my makeup off with just one. They are much smaller than I thought and I wouldn’t buy them again.,0.0
I was not wowed by this cream. I have the color correcting balm from this same line and think it’s amazing so I was expecting great things. This one didn’t do much for my redness and also felt heavy and sticky on my face. I received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster.,0.0

I also have a very oily face and when I tried this cream that quickly decreased , this cream smells like a creamsicle and is smooth and doesn’t feel think in my pores . I genuinely love this product and am beyond happy that it was sent to me , since using I have had decreased oil, a brighter face , less breakouts and softer skin, I definitely recommend!",1.0
So I waited 2 weeks to review this but the cream is ok. When put on your face the cream is thick and when I rub it into my face its very thin. I guess I was expecting something different from reading all the other reviews. I’m not sure if I even see a difference in my skin. Overall its ok..I will buy more Tatcha products however not this one once I am done.,0.0

"This is a nice moisturizer, wears well under makeup and is great as a primer. It goes on nicely and absorbs into the skin quickly, however it did nothing magical to my skin and for how pricey it is I would not consider it again. It has a little bit of a radiance and in my opinion does help to disguise imperfections a tiny tiny bit but again nothing magical. It is also extremely heavily scented, not a deal breaker for myself but if you are at all sensitive to scents definitely skip this.",0.0
This is a total game changer. I saw an extreme difference in my skin after using this. My acne flare went WAY down and my skin looked and felt smoother and more supple. Ever since I started using this I haven’t had a new breakout this stuff is like pure magic.,1.0
I have been using this sunscreen for three years now and it does not disappoint. It feels like a silicone primer and pairs well with my oily skin. It doesn’t break up my make up or irritate my skin. Also it doesn’t break my skin out or clog my pores. Will repurchase always.,1.0
It really is ordinary. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin at all. My breakouts have actually gotten worse while using this. Thank goodness it’s inexpensive otherwise I’d be upset.,0.0
"I was really excited for this brand prior to them launching at sephora and i was recently happy to get one. I have to give props to the packaging, and luxe ingredients used in the formula and i really love the texture and smell BUT putting on my chapstick before bed seriously gives me better results than this. I’ve even used it twice in one day and my lips still felt really chapped and like they needed to be exfoliated after putting it on. However, when it comes to my lips some brands work really well and a lot don’t, i just wish this gave me any results at all tbh",0.0
"This sunscreen feels smooth, lightweight and greasy initially upon application but once the product soaks in, the greasiness goes away. If you blend it too long, it will pill. My skin appeared hydrated and healthy looking all day. I don’t know if it really gave me a glow nor did I feel it evened out my skin tone after using it for a few weeks. There is a slight white cast but it’s not really noticeable. I think it’s pricey for what it has to offer.",0.0

Thin formula and nice scent. I got this product to try it out and give my feedback. The consistency is smooth and did not dry my skin at all. I have dry skin. I apply right before my self tanner for a smooth application.,1.0

This product is nice. It feels good on my skin and I don’t have any but complaints. But the scent is not my favorite. It reminds me of bathroom soap in hospitals. I also don’t feel that it made a huge difference in my skin. Just ok product.,0.0
I got this after I noticed an improvement after using the AHA from YTTP. I love both of them !This cream is thicccc. This is how i use it : wash my face with Cerave cleaning gel + dry with a towel + PC’s BHA (wait 2 min) + this product (wait 2 min for the product to sink in) + Cerave PM hydrating creamWill definitely buy again and recommend to anyone.,1.0
"I thought this was a pretty great product. i have very dry skin, so i always mix face oils with my moisturizer. they didn’t mix too well but i made it work. the scent is very strong and it takes quite a while for the product to soak in. but other than that, it does pretty well with moisturizing and that’s all i could really ask for.

"I’m not sure how this product gets such good reviews. I expected much better from this brand. It’s no better than something I could pick up at the drugstore for half the price. I had better luck with CeraVe. First of all, this smells terrible. It’s supposed to be scentless but it smells like horrible chemicals. Second, it’s a small bottle for the price. And I have to use at least 5-6 pumps to get any effect whatsoever which means this bottle isn’t going to last long. Especially compared to Kiehls, which yes, is expensive, but in comparison I can used a pea-sized amount and it’s more effective than 6 pumps of this lotion. I’ve been using this every day for two weeks and my skin is still dry. On the plus side, it hasn’t caused breakouts for me like some of the other reviewers. But I won’t be purchasing this again. Going back to Kiehls.",0.0
"I give this one star for being non-irritating. I love cleansing oils and balms. I am an avid double cleanser. But this product is a huge miss for me. It’s extremely hard to squeeze out of the tube. It feels overly greasy whether used damp or dry. It doesn’t melt into skin and dissolve dirt and makeup like other effective balms do. It doesn’t rinse well or make the skin feel pleasantly clean. I’ve tried multiple methods/combos of wet, damp, and dry use. I have no idea why it’s often sold out other than the low price. I’m going through the inconvenience of returning this product because I will get zero use out of it. Simply awful.",0.0
"Got as a sample. As other reviews indicate, nice packaging and good ingredients. Nice application - the liquid absorbs well. Sadly, just did not see any results that it claims to offer. Skin is still uneven. I can not justify buying a full bottle to even try longer because other products can produce some kind of result in less time and for a better price. I love tatcha products (love their liquid primer and water cream) but this one isn’t anything special.",0.0
It’s ok. Not worth the price point. I got it because the claims for acne prone skin. I don’t understand why a moisturizer that’s suppose to be good for acne has such a strong scent. It feels ok on the skin but nothing you can’t find in a drugstore moisturizer. Not sure if I’ll return it but definitely won’t be repurchasing,0.0
I have eczema and I use this to moisturize my face every morning. I use it for my dry skin and it works wonders. I prefer the lotion instead of the gel if you have dry skin because the lotion is a little thicker in my opinion but the texture isn’t tacky or sticky. It light weight on my face so my face doesn’t feel heavy but it feels moisturized. This is also good for sensitive skin and it doesn’t make me breakout.,1.0
"I recently recieved a sample of this. I have always heard great things about this product so I was very excited to try. Unfortunately, while I did not use this around the immediate we area, while rinsing my face a peice of the exfoliant ended up behind my eyelid. I was unable to remove it for 24hrs, it was so uncomfortable and I could feel the peice when I moved my eye. I will not be purchasing this product incase this happens again. For those who do use it I reccomend removing it with a cloth rather than rinsing your face the old fashioned way. You DO NOT WANT THESE PEICES IN YOUR EYE.  Hopefully no damage to my eye occurred.",0.0

"When I first purchased this product I would have given it a higher review than now. Honestly, it is very good, but not worth 80.00. Many less expensive glycolic exfoliaters can give comparable results. It doesn’t last very long, and the packaging is deceiving. I don’t like it when I can’t tell when my product is almost out. It is a good mask, just not worth the price in my estimation.",0.0

"Absolutely adore this sunscreen! At first I thought I wouldn’t like it because it has a moderate fragrance to it, but I found that it fades after about 30 minutes and is pretty undetectable after that. I love the way this glides on like a dream, and feels more like a lotion than a sunscreen. If you like dewy sunscreens, you will love this. Probably best for people with dry or combo skin since it is so moisturizing. But really, you have to try it. It sinks in like a moisturizer, makes you glows and no eye burn!! I’m medium skin-toned and it has given me zero white cast. I’m super happy with this sunscreen!!",1.0

This moisturizer is very heavy and has a waxy texture that makes it feel too thick and even sticky. When I removed it with micellar water it also left a yellow tint on my cotton pad which I found odd as well. I didn’t notice any benefits to my skin.,0.0
Absolutely horrible!!!!! It caused me to have chemical burn and i still have it and i used the mask a week ago. Please do not purchase.,0.0
"Ok… so I really wanted to love this. I’m so disappointed. I was very excited to receive it; I had been looking for an overnight lip mask. I have very dry skin, never breaks out. The first night I wore this mask, I woke up with a huge angry pimple right underneath my bottom lip. Some of the product will move off of your lips and on to you skin when you’re sleeping. So I give the product the benefit of the doubt and try it again 2 days later. The next day I wake up with two large pimples above my top lip. I will not fall for it again. Will not be using this product ever again, and I also would not recommend it.",0.0
"I had the chance to discover this game thanks to Topbox Circle #freeproduct.

"This product isn’t terrible but isn’t my absolute fave either. It’s a pretty thick balm that definitely coats the lips but I think that it’s lacking moisturizing properties because it doesn’t leave my lips super hydrated feeling. I tend to drink a lot of water through the night and it stays on okay but I feel like I get the same results, if not better results from a basic chapstick. I have used this product during the day and though it’s a bit sticky it leaves your lips looking great.",0.0
"this product worked fine at first, however one day the mask was itching a bit more than usual, which I didn’t think was a big deal.

"This is way too pricey for what it is (in my opinion). I have combo skin that’s normal/dry. My main concerns are acne scarring and hyperpigmentation. It smells nice, but I didn’t find any changes in my skin after using half of the jar. I have used much cheaper products that are much more moisturizing. I really don’t want to finish the jar because it’s not doing anything for me, but it’s so expensive I’m forcing myself to finish it.",0.0

"I absolutely love the  Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant. It is extra fine so the exfoliating beads are so tiny so they get into all the micro places. When you add water into the mix and you lather, it turns into a mousse type soapy lather texture after. It is unisex friendly as I asked my boyfriend to try it on his skin. He has oily combination skin and I have dry combination skin. It worked wonders for both of us and we both loved how it made our skin feel so fresh. It can be used for morning to the evening because the beads are so fine this product can be used multiple times per day without heavy abrasion. It brightens up my skin, feels soft to the touch and freshens the skin up!",1.0
Great and hydrating but dries really quick and is a little too sticky,1.0
Similar to the rest of the product line this is very heavily scented. It also left me with a sticky residue. I wasn’t a fan.,0.0
I love how light and clean this feels on the skin. The spout allows for just the right amount to come out.  It spreads over the skin easily and absorbs fairly quickly.  Works great in combination with the Tatcha brightening serum. My skin looked plumper and more even within 7 days of using this. I did receive this free for complementary testing.,1.0
I love this cleanser! It does a great job removing makeup and it rinses well. It has a nice light fruity scent. It doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. It is a bit overpriced but I would still repurchase.,1.0
It’s goopy and sticky...  don’t see a noticeable difference.... wouldn’t recommend it.,0.0
"Straight up, this is essentially sake without the alcohol. It is an ancient beauty routine to throw fermented rice on your skin..something about bread yeast I guess. I have been using this for 5 months and I am almost done with the bottle. It will probably last 6 months (fortunate for me thats the suggested expiration date). I keep this in the fridge for a cool splash to the face and to preserve all the fermented yum yum. It is water so keep that in mind when you pour it out. I have not noticed any plumpness and softening. Mostly, it feels nice after a hot shower and after derma rolling. My BFF swears by it. TBH, its $100 for sake on the face and lasts 6 months, thats $200 a year for something that MAYBE works. When I run out of this, I will be looking for an essence that is less expensive and has fermented bread yeast/rice in addition to a water formula. I just don’t find the value in paying $200 a year to see if maybe it helps me look better when I am older....but then again, I also use vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, retinol, derma roll, and religiously slather on sunscreen so I think I won’t be able to tell if it does make a difference.It feels nice on the face though!",0.0
"Although this doesn’t smell typically like caramel, it’s a sweet but somewhat artificial fragrance with a detectable citrus note in it. The balm itself has quite a thick texture and is quite rich. It leaves a nice sheen on my lips which keeps them plumped and looking good whilst the balm is on, however I don’t feel it provides any long-term hydration or conditioning and my lips feel pretty much as they did before, once I’ve washed this off. The balm itself also doesn’t last very long. I started with the Coconut version which I found much more true to how it should smell, although neither that pot, nor the Caramel one have lasted me for longer than 3 weeks each. At the price point they are, I was hoping they would last longer and for anyone with very dry lips (mine are not even that dry) they would be going through these at quite a fast rate. ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.

This cleanser was not at all enjoyable for me. I used a mini size for a month or two and by the end I was so fed up with it that I couldn’t wait to use another cleanser. The texture was slimy and uncomfortable and it didn’t clean off my non-waterproof makeup. I’d always have to go back with some micellar water to remove the black streaks of mascara from under my eyes. I’ve never had any issues getting my mascara off with other cleansers. The worst part for me was the smell. I’ve had good experiences with other Fresh products but unfortunately this cleanser did not work for me at all.,0.0

"If you are looking for a product that cleanses and smooths skin in one, this is the one for you! It is perfect for all skin types, especially those like me with sensitive skin. It can be used as a first step in the double cleansing process, or on its own, and does a great job with breaking down and melting products on your face; including heavy makeup and spf. Ingredients such as papaya enzymes help to gently exfoliate, smoothie and soften the skin. While, papaya extract and oils help to provide the skin with vitamins a, c and e, which aid in moisturizing. Finally, Camélia Japonica seed oil and apricot kernel oil help to nourish the skin. I loved the packaging, the product smells great and comes with a mini scoop. Get this product if you want smooth, hydrated and moisturized skin that glows.",1.0
"WOW! I don’t usually say this but you need to try this. I got the deluxe sample and decided to try it out because I keep hearing about adding vitamin c and aha to your skin care... Even though I have super sensitive skin and dermatitis. My skin has suffered this winter, it’s dull, dehydrated, I’m noticing fine lines, It’s very textured and congested. I’ve been using  this everyday for a maybe a week or so. And my skin had improved so much! I had a bunch of breakouts and texture on my forehead, it’s down about 85%. Any acne scarring and redness has gone or almost all gone. The fine line mark is half of what it use to be. And my skin just feels brighter more hydrated and way less textured and dull. I was kind of shocked at the price at first but honestly I bought two products in the fall, a serum and essence, to help with the skin concerns I was having. And they helped to a degree but I was still breaking out and getting flakey dull skin. And the two combined still cost a little more than this bottle. I will definitely be purchasing the full size. I hope they come out with a mini though, that would be awesome.",1.0

"At first, I was unenthused upon reading the description of the product and ingredients -- salicylic acid has been around forever. However, I thought I’d try a sample anyway because I like this product line; Caudelie was highly recommended by the skincare girls at Sephora. So I used this sample while I was traveling (usually a time of stress and unpredictability for my skin). The first day I used it, it shrank two of my whiteheads into oblivion. The second day I used it, I noticed the giant patches of cystic acne that had been plaguing me start to shrink. Right when you put it on, your face feels like it’s shrinking, but it doesn’t feel dehydrating at all because of the soothing ingredients. When I realized what I had found, I cut out all the other makeup products and skincare items except for cleansers and eye cream. Truly, this product was the beginning of my skincare revolution and a real turning point for me. I picked up a bottle as soon as I got home, but the texture of my skin is smoothing out for the first time in months. I still have dark spots, so I’ll probably use the Vinoperfect in the morning to help with that. I’m sold and devoted to this product now. It’s been three weeks, and I’m finally getting the skin that I want. I would recommend this product even to people who have tried other AHAs or BHAs before and found themselves unimpressed or irritated. There is just something about this product that healed me.",1.0

didn’t do much for me. still had fine lines and puffiness. it feels light but I got get milia.

It’s been weeks and I still haven’t fully recovered. I only used a pea size amount when applying. My skin is combination/oily in the t-zone and I suffer from hormonal acne.

"I have to say that I am not impressed at all by this Dermalogica Microfoliant, and I would not purchase the full size for a variety of reasons. 1.)   It is very messy.  You lose a lot of product just by pouring granules in your hands, and rubbing palms together, which means that you are literally putting money down the drain.  2.)  It’s so gentle that I frankly do not think there are any results as compared to other similar exfoliating products in this price range.  If you are going to spend this much, why not get a product that gives you visible results after a couple of uses instead of this? 3.) I do not think it is that revolutionary or earth friendly that this is in granule form instead of a liquid.  It benefits the company in the sense that they can ship more product for the same amount of money by weight, but the bottles take up the same amount of space in a truck or shipping container, and take the same amount of gas to haul around, and the consumer has to add water anyway, so I don’t see much value-added.   I have used other Dermalogica products in the past and enjoyed them, but this specific item does not resonate with me.  This sample packet was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.",0.0
I really love this face cleanser. I have super dry skin so the fact that it makes it smooth and feel so refreshed is awesome !

"Not for me. I have combination skin, and this did nothing for either combo. The oily parts remained oily, and the (what i consider normal) felt dried out.

I did not have a tanning lotion smell but noticed that I didn’t really have a “tan”, it was more of a tan glow. I applied the drops again a second night to make the tan darker with a few more drops but didn’t really notice much. I decided to return the drops to try the tanning mouse.

It is a weird consistency and I don’t like how it feels on my face. It does go on green but does not turn beige on my skin. It ends up looking greasy and white. It does not cover the redness I can still see it. It is currently sitting in my medicine cabinet all the way in the back. My skin tone is olive and it makes me look like a ghost.,0.0
"I just don’t get the appeal.  It’s fine.  I have normal to dry skin, would not call this moisturizing. I keep trying it again and again because the reviews are so strong but I have to say I don’t think this does anything for me.",0.0
"This would be good or even great if it didn’t pill. i know how to do skincare and i know it’s not a me problem. its starts to pill/crust off throughout the day. at first i liked it bc it didn’t do that right away and there weren’t little balls of ss on my hand, but it you looks closely it pulls terribly",0.0
The best moisturizer!!! Coming from a skin care junkie this is the best moisturizer I’ve found yet! My skin actually feels smooth and healthy after using this!,1.0
This is an amazing eye cream! First I love the adorable and convenient packaging. The bright  twist top leaves it to convenient to travel with and simply use. I also love how thick it is but doesn’t leave your eyes feeling tacky. Using only about a half of a pump nightly has left my eyes looking bright and more firm after only a few weeks. This is definitely a must have and a product I will continue to buy!,1.0
"Bomb, love the way it feels and the ingredients are always top notch and ahead of the gang.",1.0
"To be honest, this isn’t horrible even though I’m only giving it 3 stars. My skin liked it, my wallet hates it. Don’t be fooled by the size of the container, there isn’t much in here! But also don’t be fooled by that, as a little bit does go a long way IF you warm it up on your hands first because it is THICC and doesn’t spread well at all if you apply it right to your skin in little dots. I didn’t break out from it, which surprised me since it is so thick. There’s virtually no scent thank goodness, but honestly it’s just not worth dang near $40. Elf makes a moisturizer that I like more and that’s $12 *shrug*",0.0
"I received this complements of influenster for testing purposes, BUT DON’T SKIP THIS! whenever I want to check a product out thru reviews I skip the ones who got the product for free, I honestly try to find flaws with my campaign items for this reason I hate giving 5 stars lol their reviews always seem the same.. HOWEVER this serum really is very pleasant. I’m a serum junky, I’m very particular, and while I can’t attest to its physical changes just yet I really like the texture and the barely-there scent. I love the glass bottle and how you can see the milky serum inside. and I LOVE love how this melts quickly into skin WITH NO STICKINESS AFTERWARDS!! it didn’t make my moisturizer pill up afterwards either but I’ve been using a lighter one. I have high hopes for this serum and will return if I find a flaw. until then, highly recommend and so grateful I received this to test because it’s not something I would’ve considered on my own and I like it!",1.0
Love glowy bomb for during the day! This smells like grape and I love it!! Kind of like big league chew fun grape not like a medicine kind of grape. And the color is sheer once in the lips.,1.0
Hate to say it but this cleanser was definitely a let down. It says it’s okay for dry skin but every time i’ve used this my skin feels very tight and dried out after. It also doesn’t do a great job of taking my makeup off unless I use it like twice and that dries my skin out even more. I like the consistency and how it’s in a glass bottle but it’s not worth it in my opinion. If you have dry skin I would probably stay away from this,0.0
"I tried a sample of the Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb. It smells similar than the Aqua Bomb, but a little lighter. For me is a pleasant smell. I applied in my eye every night after cleaning the skin. The cream gets absorbed by the skin right away and it doesn’t leave a sticky sensation. I think my eye got very moisturized. I have very sensitive skin and after using the product for several days, I had no bad reactions. I used the eye bomb together with the Aqua Bomb from Belif and thought they were a great combination.",1.0
This mask feels heavy and greasy on my skin. Though it is an overnight mask I feel like the product is rubbing off on my pillow if I sleep on the side. A def no go for me.,0.0

"I decided to try this for my October birthday gift and so far so good! I appreciate that a little goes a long way, and it feels very hydrating. The smell is very light and floral. I will say that it feels a tad tacky, so that’s my only “complaint“... even though I don’t mind it. I tested this product as part of a contest, but all opinions are my own*",1.0
"Tried out my Advanced Night Serum free sample this past week. I’m honestly not very impressed, after a week of nightly use I didn’t see any changes. The bottle top is a pour out style, and the instructions on how to apply were just ridiculous. I did like the texture of it, and the scent was a nice neutral.",1.0
"I received this in my #influenster #voxbox Went on smooth, non sticky.  I barely have a few crows feet, abs do not want any. Did not see any dramatic results,  yet it did keep my eyes and around my eyes from becoming dry since I was out in the sun all week. That is why I gave it all 5 stars. Yet,  honestly, would not spend the amount of money on this, sticking with Vaseline around my eyes, has not failed me yet.",0.0
"purchased based on good reviews. used this for 2 weeks... kept smelling cat pee after and finally realized it was from this. some ingredient in this triggers that smell.. so peculiar. very unpleasant. also started breaking out and that hasn’t happened in years. soon as I stopped using it , didn’t smell cat pee anymore. this is a no go for my sinuses and sensitive skin.",0.0
"Does the job great, takes off all face makeup, including stubborn eye",1.0
I like this product. It gets off the hard to remove makeup like eyeliner and mascara without irritating my skin or making it feel stripped.,1.0
THE. BEST. EVER.  I’d been looking high and low for a good moisturizer and spent $$$$ left and right. None worked till I got this. Affordable and an excellent product. I also use the daytime moisturizer and the vitamin C Rose oil/serum. Ordering my 4th one now.,1.0
I have very dry skin but this leaves my skin baby smooth well into the next day. Hands down the most hydrating night cream I have ever used.,1.0
"All I can say is WOW!!! I have a lot of allergies to different ingredients and foods, and by far this mask is unreal. I used it the other night for the first time, and as soon as it dried i immediately saw a difference and felt a huge difference in my skin. I usually never brake out (once a month) and the belif products broke me out BAD. I was skeptical but with the reviews i gave it a shot. MIND BLOWN. A little goes a long way and this definitely will last you a while. 10/10. Definitely giving their other products a shot too.",1.0
"I was so hesitant to buy this product with the price, but I’m really glad that I did. as everyone says, the texture is very strange, and the second you put it on your face you can feel it mattify. I wouldn’t go for this if you have dry skin, but for my extremely oily skin, it works great. makeup can be easily applied on top which is awesome. this is the only sunscreen that works for my acne prone skin!! despite the price, I will absolutely repurchase when my current tube runs out.",1.0
"I have extremely sensitive, dry skin and nearly everything gives me a rash. This serum didn’t! My skin looks and feels amazing and glowy. It also smells incredible! I’m so happy with this and will be repurchasing in the future.",1.0
Not sure what the hype was about.  Good marketing?,0.0
"Felt great on my skin, and I really like how it doesn’t have harmful chemicals that cheaper masks tend to use to clean skin. And it has a calming scentand didn’t dry me out. I did receive this free to test, but I would have bought it for real!",1.0
"Feels buttery soft, pretty packaging and smells good but that’s about it. It’s definitely hyped and not a holy grail product in terms of moisturizing and replenishing your lips. Basically a lip balm splurge.",0.0
"I really had low expectations for this. I have sensitive skin and things either don’t work, or they fry my skin because they’re so harsh. This is the FIRST product of many tried that actually exfoliates my skin and calms down my acne. It’s been worth the money and I’m a loyal REN customer now.",1.0
"Okay so I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I first tried this product I honestly didn’t like it, it tingles, stings and honestly kind of burnt (I don’t have sensitive skin) but after a few minutes that went away. I left it on overnight and washed it off in the morning and honestly I’m kind of impressed! My skin is super glowy and looks clear and fresh. However I wouldn’t recommend it if you have sensitive skin. I’d give it more stars but it was really uncomfortable when first applied.",0.0
So far so good! I’ve been using for almost a month and can really tell how calmed down my face looks. I have some red skin/discoloration and dullness but this has brightened my skin quite a bit,1.0
"This is the first product that has compelled me to write a review. I have been SEARCHING for a product that would tackle my combination skin. My main concern on my face was the skin around and on my nose being dry & flaky, so I asked for a product that would address that and am so glad to have been introduced to this serum. I’ve been using this for almost a month now and my skin looks so much better. My dry flaky skin on my nose cleared up probably after 2 weeks of using this (day & night), and I’ve also noticed my pores look smaller.. like overall, my skin looks “cleaner” if that makes sense. Anyway, product feels really good applying and while on the skin. It also smells good! I just can’t get over how awesome this serum has been for me, definitely going to be trying more of this line!",1.0
It’s just ok....I am 44 with dry and sometimes dehydrated skin.  I had high hopes for this product.  I did not feel the moisture or see any glow after using this. Maybe too light weight for my mature skin.  I have tried many Glow Recipe items and have realized they are not for me.,0.0
"Love this stuff. It makes me glow, smooths any texture, and my complexion looks so much better when I use it. It’s a must for my routine now. Use it at night after washing my face.",1.0

It’s fine. Definitely not a holy grail and I don’t find it really quenches dry skin as much as I would like and I think there are better products at a much better price.,0.0

"I had super dry skin, so dry it was practically flaking off. I went to Sephora and asked for the best moisturizer for dry skin and one of the workers introduced me to this product. Not even going to lie, it is THEE best moisturizer I have ever tried. My skin has never felt softer. My makeup applies so much better and isn’t now patchy anymore from the dry skin I had. It worked within 1/2 days of using. Instant results. I recommend this product if you have super dry skin.",1.0
"I wanted to love this like everyone else. The smell is so pleasant and refreshing and the packaging is so pretty. But even with my normal-slightly oily skin, this made me feel like I was losing the moisture I worked so hard to finally establish in my skin. Like it Cleansed a little too well. Also I can’t justify the almost $40 price tag. :(",0.0
"I love this product so much, I received with my Birthday gift from last year. This product has worked amazing for my lips and I love the smell, I definitely recommend using.",1.0
I love this product. The lemon scent smells so good. I didn’t feel any tingling like the box said. It does leave my face looking brighter in the morning.,1.0
My Must Have! My face loves this moisturizer. The scent on wonderful and bright and the product goes on great - not greasy or heavy.,1.0
"Hands Down the Best Exfoliator !! Ive been using the KS exfolikate treatment for years, Its my go to when I have a little extra texture in my skin that I want to get rid of helping my makeup apply more smoothly.  A little goes a long way with this one so definitely do not leave it on for more than the recommended time. The results are absolutely amazing, it always leaves my skin feeling so smooth and gives my complexion a little extra radiance when I use it. Will forever keep this in rotation in my skincare regimen, Highly Recommend Complimentary from Kate Somerville",1.0

"This product was gifted by Sunday Riley but this review is my own. Since using Good Genes, I found that I have smaller pores and my fine lines by my eyes have all but disappeared. I’ve never used a lactic acid before, so this kind of product was new to me. I began using it once a day, but found that to be too harsh. Using Good Genes once every three days has made my chronic acne much less noticeable, which is honestly such a relief to me as nothing else I’ve tried has worked. I am in big trouble because this product comes with a high (but well earned!) price tag, and once this bottle is gone I’m going to need to buy more.",1.0
"Perfect when you’re having a skincare type of day, but pills like crazy under makeup and looks so bad. I don’t recommend using it before you put on makeup at all even if you wait for it to “set“ it still piles.",0.0
"This is a high quality face cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling soft but doesn’t strip it of moisture. The smell is just lovely with a light hint of cucumber. You only need a small amount of this so this will last you a long time. With high quality ingredients, this will do nothing but good things for your face! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1.0
One of the best masks out there was great for my dry skin. Definitely a great thing to keep on hand for traveling for instant hydration,1.0
"Would be five stars because the first jar I got from Drunk Elephant was perfect, and the sample I got from Sephora previously was as well. However, this last one was slightly yellow, primarily on the top and sides as if it had separated, with the center (now that I’ve used 1/3 I can see the difference) being the true milky color of previous jars. Works alright and no weird smell but the color change is a little worrisome.",0.0

After using it for 2 days (day & night), my skin was irritated and was very obviously red/flushed. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.",0.0
"I received this item as a free sample, and I am so happy I did. I find that this works better as a lightweight moisturizer rather than a toner, but the benefit is you do not have to wear a moisturizer to seal in this product. This has been extremely useful during summer because it is lighter than your average “lightweight” moisturizer. My skin immediately feels hydrated and it looks nourished. Down fall, product doesn’t dispense well unless you shake it.",1.0
"This is amazing. I loved my face wash but this ups the game. Smells great, feels great",1.0
"I started using this about 2 weeks ago. I had noticed the undereye darkness is slowly diminishing. What I did is, I stored it in the fridge and it’s so relaxing every time I apply it around my eyes with a gentle massage. I like it.",1.0
"Gives a nice glow without being sticky or smelly. It mixes right in with your moisturizer to give your skin a sunkissed glow. I have acne prone skin and am unable to use self tanners on my face, but this product does not make me break out",1.0
These have changed my skin. I have less acne and acne scaring. It hasn’t upset or made my sensitive skin break out and hasn’t dried my skin out. I usually only use 1/2 of a pad on my face because they are so wet and saturated with serum. I love these. If you are new to chemical exfoliants you should give these a try. HOLY GRAIL!!,1.0
"In love with these, i got acne, red irritated skin, after a few use, i skin plumped up, fresh and reduce redness. Use only twice a week because it will dry up your skin. Must have item for skincare girlssss!!!",1.0
I like the widness of the balm. I actually prefer it that way.  At 1st appearance it looks really small but once you realize it’s a lot wider than most normal chap sticks you get the same amount just in a different shape technically The glides on nice and smooth with no tacky or stickiness left over.,1.0
"Unfortunately contains a small amount of silicone. After about a week of use, it started to make me break out. It did not absorb fully into my skin. However, very hydrating.",0.0
"I have dry skin and I’m experiencing the initial signs of aging like a bit of jowliness and some facial creasing. I received this to testand it did an excellent job moisturizing and seemed to give me a little glow but since my tester was a trial size I can’t really attest to any noticeable lifting or firming. Overall it’s a nice, thick, rich cream but it is rather expensive.",1.0
"While I’m only giving three stars it’s not because I don’t like it, it’s because I didn’t have the opportunity to use it longer. I received a sample size from Influenster and it was used up pretty quickly. The product is not too thick which I loved and the scent isn’t too strong. However, I couldn’t wear it at night because I can’t sleep with scented products on me. I do think I’d like it and rate it higher if I had more to use because it did make my skin feel soft and it wore well under makeup.",1.0
"I don’t say this lightly: this is the best stuff on earth. Like many people, my lips can get easily chapped, in spite of wearing lip balm on a daily basis. The lip mask is amazing. With nightly use, my lips have become soft, plump and totally healthy. It feels great on my lips too - soothing and comfortable, a luxurious part of my nightly routine. And a little goes a long way, so the full size lasts a long time.",1.0
"I was excited to be chosen to test and review this product from Influenster! I love products like this and this one is no exception. Yes, it is a little pricey, but if you look at similar products (Peter Thomas Roth for example) they are more expensive. This works just as well. I didn’t notice a strong scent from this. I used this as directed and it immediately peels the dead skin right off! For those complaining about the scrub getting “tacky” and “clumping” it’s not the scrub, it’s the dead skin on your face! This worked really well and my skin felt sooo smooth and looked better afterwards! You don’t need to scrub your skin hard to get the dead skin off, I found this to be really gentle. Since this has Ahas though, I would use this at night before bed followed by a moisturizer, or followed by sunscreen during the day, because it can make your skin more susceptible to burning! Overall, I’m very pleased with this product and I’m looking forward to continue using this product!",1.0
Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I really liked how foamy this product was after adding water. I liked how it made my face feel soft after. I didn’t notice any change in my acne I have. It didn’t seem to help quicken or keep it away.,0.0
"Fresh does it again! I’ve always been a big fan of the products in their Rose line and this moisturizer is no exception. The texture is creamy yet lightweight and provides for serious hydration (72 hours worth!) Love that it makes my skin plump and dewy constantly, with the time release technology. Definitely worth giving this one a try.",1.0
"I have oily and sensitive skin, i also have a little rosacea. i wanted to like this but i tried this for a few weeks and all it did was clog my pores and made my skin more red and inflamed. also leaves a sticky residue on my face its very thick. Smells ok it smells like old roses to me.",0.0

"I got this as a sample from Sephora. Honestly it’s okay!! It does the same job as any other cleanser that i have tried.To he honest, it reminds me a little of the St ives abricot scrub, because of the scrub that it contains (which is terrible) It might be harsh for the face. And i am not a big fan of the smell. Overall it’s fine. Wouldn’t think about purchasing it, because first of all it’s expensive for a cleanser that does an average job and second of all because of the scrub that it has (which i don’t trust)",0.0

"This product was fine (surprisingly) but I have used way better and more affordable chemical exfoliators in the past. My skin type is dry and acne prone, so I like to exfoliate gently three times a week, rather than using a harsh product once a week. My skin was smooth in the morning after using this, but I’d be nervous about using it frequently because it has a very strong smell and contained a lot of alcohol. If you have sensitive skin, I’d pass. While this product worked, I would definitely not repurchase.",0.0

very happy with this product. my eyes def look brighter after using it -key step is laying a good eye cream over it ( i’ve been using Kiehl’s Avocado) or it will dry the under eye area out. added bonus- it got rid of my under eye milia in a little over 2 weeks!,1.0
IT SMELLS SO UNBELIEVABLY BAD! And my skin didn’t even feel that soft after sooooo pass,0.0
I highly recommend this product. It has been very helpful to use. I have atopic dermititis so I’m careful with what I use on my skin. This is light and easy to apply while still being super hydrating. It is pricey but a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. I use it on its own after shower and before bed and also under makeup concealer to help avoid the dry look I can sometimes get due to my sensitive skin.,1.0
"I wanted to love this. All the other Tatcha products I’ve tried have been excellent but I just…don’t get this. It’s sticky as heck, doesn’t last, doesn’t really moisturize my lips and it’s expensive. Vaseline does a better job.",0.0
"I have combination skin. My oily spots tend to get more greasy with this moisturizer but it’s really hydrating. It goes on pretty thick. I really haven’t noticed any long term effects of this moisturizer. It is pretty heavily scented, which I wasn’t a fan of. I probably wouldn’t buy it again.",0.0

You don’t need much to get a real scrub out of this. Your face will feel minty fresh and tingly. I honestly like a reaction out of these expensive products and this does just that. I like to scrub it on my blemishes and I feel like it sometimes reduces the blemish. Will continue to purchase.,1.0
"I have combo skin, very oily t-zone and dry on my jaw and chin line, with all over facial redness due to irritating ingredients and transitioning to gentle skin care to help reduce the redness and was looking for a temporary fix as I get my skin back to its normal tone. But this product ain’t it. It is VERY thick so try to use a pea size amount, wouldn’t recommend putting foundation over it, powder maybe a better fit, however if you have facial redness/sensitivity/rosacea you might not like this product cause you really have to rub this product in for a while, especially to get rid of the little beads in this product, and for any of my red faced people you know any harsh or prolong rubbing is just gonna make your skin even more red, so I felt like it defeats the purpose of hiding redness. I’m also tan and this made my face look paler than the rest of my body, so it doesn’t adjust to medium-tan skin tones unfortunately, mostly likely better for light-fair skin.",0.0

"I really wanted to like this product…I mean I reallyyyyy wanted to considering the price tag, but this moisturizer just did not do it for me. Working it in the skin is a struggle, even after rubbing it between your fingers first. It goes on like legit drywall putty. Its very thick and sits on top of the skin (not in a good way), and to be honest, feels like a face mask i should be washing off. The smell isnt terrible to me, but I could see how its not for everyone. I will be sticking with my Confidence in a Cream by IT Cosmetics!",0.0

I like the watermelon scent better but both are not bad. does irritate my eyes or dry them out.,1.0
"Love how light and fresh it feels!  And the watermelon scent is amazing.  As someone prone to breakouts, I am always cautious when trying new skincare products, but I can say that this never breaks me out!  It provides the perfect amount of moisture and keeps the skin looking glowy!!",1.0
"I wanted to love this cream so bad but it’s honestly doesn’t do much other than make your skin feel good/soothed, which I guess is ok bc it’s not marketing itself as anything other than that, if it weren’t for the fact that it gives texture to the skin. My skin at this point is generally calm and acne free unless it’s around my time of the month, but I do struggle with getting even textured skin and non clogged pores which this seems to exacerbate. It never made me breakout but it just sort of clogs my pores and makes my skin look congested. I figured it wasn’t for me and gave to my boyfriend who is in his 40s and has NO acne or skin problems other than aging, and after using it for a week straight I noticed that his skin was also congested and clogged looking on the forehead and bumpy on his nose. I also had a friend who used this who never broke out but up close her skin also had a lot of texture...so just buyer beware",0.0
"I bought a sample size of this and really wanted it to be my new HG moisturizer. The first few days of using it I woke up to my skin feeling incredibly smooth and hydrated. After 3 or 4 days however, I started to break out horribly on my chin with new pimples every time I used it. I have combo sensitive skin and only use ultra clean oils and moisturizers so I was shocked. Since I have stopped using it my chin cleared up, just wasn’t for me.",0.0
"I received this product complimentary to review honestly. With that said, I like the consistency and texture of the product but unfortunately it didn’t seem to do anything for my hereditary dark circles. I also don’t have deep fine lines so it was hard to see any noticeable difference in terms of wrinkles. It also seemed to irritate the skin under my right eye. Not a product for me.",0.0
"✨I received this product for free from Influenster, Belif, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.✨Here’s what I love about the Sephora Ultra Glow Serum:-It’s free of mineral oil-It’s vegan-It comes in recycled packaging-Feels silky-Smells niceWhile those are awesome pros, I have to admit I’d give this product a 3.5/5 stars at best.It goes on pretty watery and I find the application messy because it’s constantly slipping through my fingers.It dries pretty quickly, but my face feels tacky/sticky for 10-15 minutes after application.Lastly, I’ve tried other Vitamin C serums that I NOTICE. Like, glowing skin IMMEDIATELY, and this one just didn’t hit like that. It’s certainly not terrible, but it’s not going to become my go-to serum.Still grateful for the opportunity to try something new!",0.0
I like the product itself but the packaging is not ideal. The screw top makes it difficult to use and its hard to only squeeze a small amount. It needs a flip cap like most cleansers,1.0
"I received this complimentary but my review is my own. I thought the product was sufficient but it didn’t leave me in awe of how smooth and moisturized my face felt after like other moisturizers That I have used. If you have super oily skin, this would probably be perfect for you. My skin tends to be dryer so I like to have a thicker moisturizer.",0.0
"I received this product complimentary of Influenster to review and really love it. I have sensitive skin and was worried that the product might be a bit harsh but it wasn’t at all. I did follow the instructions and made sure to use it before bed to reduce the reaction to sunlight. The toner provided a light exfoliation, really brightened my complexion and reduced my discolouration. Really excited to keep using it and see how it performs in the long run",1.0
"I bought this due to its hype and hyram’s recommendation, and I have oily acne-prone skin and I didn’t love it. Didn’t make my face feel super clean after or hydrated. It is an okay cleanser, maybe it didn’t work for my skin type, and it will work for yours.",0.0
"Favourite!!! Skin is so smooth in the morning, plus I can make a face massage with this concentrate! Love it!",1.0
"I’ve been using this as my first cleanse consistently for 3 months and my final verdict is that it does an okay job at removing makeup, but it leaves an uncomfortable, slippy residue when I try to rinse it off. Normally that wouldn’t bother me because I’m on a budget and I’ll usually like something as long as it does its job, but I won’t repurchase this because I feel like there has to be a better makeup remover balm on the market. Bottom line: skip this one.",0.0
"I was so excited to receive this as a free product! It smells AMAZING. I started using it in late spring and I can’t say my lips were transformed, which is kind of what I would hope for with this price tag. But the really disappointing part came as it changed to summer - it melted! Not in my car or purse, but in a light free and cool environment. Hydrating and gorgeous smell, but not worth it.",0.0
"This really didn’t do anything for my lips, it didn’t leave them softer than they were before and it doesn’t last long after application. Overall, it was a waste of money. I’m just grateful it didn’t dry my lips out and that the scent is nice but other than that there aren’t many pro’s to this at all compared to other lip masks and balms available.",0.0

Hope fresh can formulate this without fragrance.",1.0
This burned my skin as soon as I put it on really regretting buying this. Trying to return it.,0.0
"I’m obsessed with this product! I use this in place of a foundation, as the green tint and anti redness combat my ruddy nose/chin area, and it has SPF so I can skip that step. If you have blemishes, I recommend a spot concealer (I use Barbara sturm) to neutralize that extra redness. If it’s very red, sometimes I’ll use that and do an extra dab of this product on top again, so that my finish remains consistent.This is NOT a moisturizer, which may confuse some of the reviewers. I wear this on top of my regular hydrating moisturizer and achieve a dewy, neutral finish, adding just blush or bronzer on top.My only other caveat is that I’ve recommended this to so many friends, and those with darker complexions have complained the green base can be greying. I’m quite fair so this works for me; If you’re too golden/olive/dark for Dr Jart’s BB creams, this will not be for you unfortunately. At least you are blessed with golden skin!",1.0
I hate to leave a negative review but this did nothing. It tugs on your skin as you apply it and it wasn’t cooling or de-puffing at all. It feels like you’re just putting another layer of product on your face and leaves a sticky residue. Not worth the money even for the trial size.,0.0

Works well and have not had any issues using it for about a month. But I prefer the Dewy one more - I find that one to be SUPER hydrating.,0.0
I use this as a neck cream over my Iconolab Renewal Oil. Very rich and emollient. Our necks age too! Lol this keeps my skin soft and elastic.,1.0
"Works fine as a double cleanse, but works exactly like the grape seed oil I normally use to take off makeup before cleansing. Leaves a film, smells bad.",0.0

"At first I thought this face wash was really nice and refreshing, but after a week of use I broke out on my ENTIRE face.

As soon as I switched to a different face wash my acne cleared up within a week. Ugh so disappointed",0.0
"It smells like baby oatmeal and has all of 5 little beads to scrub your face with- and that is with using a generous  amount.

"I originally tried this cleanser at the beginning of 2020 when I was given a sample and loved it. Unfortunately the product was completely sold out for the majority of the year. I finally got my hands on a bottle a month or two ago and was thrilled because I really enjoyed the sample. One review caught my eye, someone mentioned that the new formula is terrible for sensitive skin now. I wish I had listened, my skin was sooo dry and parched it was flaking off. It stripped my skin of any moisture and hydration, leaving it highly stressed and irritated. I finally stopped using it and my skin improved over night. A week later and it’s as my skin never had an issue before. This will be used the clean makeup brushes from here on out!",0.0
"I love this! I started using LipSense at the beginning of the year and have stayed away from waxy chapsticks for a few months now. However, the lip balm is pricey through them so I wanted to find an alternative. This stuff is amazing! I didn’t like the scent/ flavor at first but I got used to it. I bought another recently so I don’t have to keep taking it in and out of my purse when I’m at home.",1.0
"I received this product through Influenster for free in exchange for my thoughts and opinions. I wanted to love this product so much, but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. It left tiny little bumps anywhere I put it. It’s a great concept for people who hate the feeling of serums. Hate it didn’t work for me.",0.0
"Love this product. It makes taking off my make up so easy. Mind you, I do have a two step process but this is great and super user friendly. My skin had no breakouts at all.",1.0

I like this product but I don’t feel like it does anything for my skin. It has such a great smell!,1.0
"I loved both the scent of this product and the lightweight moisturizing effect that worked great with my combo skin! I will say that it had the same slightly tight feel on my face once it soaked in that other gel moisturizers have also had, so it may work best on a slightly oilier skin type.",1.0
"Very moisturizing, makes my skin soft! It’s nice and thick, which I personally like since I have dry skin.",1.0
It was gentle on my skin and left it feeling refreshed and clean. Easy took off makeup as well.,1.0
I got to try Clarins Double serum through butterly. I hot a seven day sample and I really do love the sample format of having a card you break to release the product and mix it. It makes it easy to take skincare with you anywhere. Over the summer I have spent  a lot of time in the sun so I’m looking for a product to help keep a healthy glow and combat some sun damage. This product is get to even skin tone and moisture the skin.,1.0
This review is specifically for the smaller size. I love this stuff and have always bought the larger size but this time wanted a smaller one to more easily take with me on trips. I just opened it and it’s barely half full. Will be returning for the full size.,0.0
"I received a small sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox. The texture of the cream is good and can be layered. I tried this on its own and over top of the serum. I can’t speak to the long term effects, as the sample was not large enough to use for more than a few days. The cream didn’t cause any reactions - redness or breakouts. I did not find the cream hydrating enough for my combination skin, but it might be enough in the more humid summer months. Overall a nice cream if you have oilier skin.",1.0
I am dry - normal combination. I used this product as a mask & moisturizer as suggested. I did not feel like this hydrated my face. I would have to reapply another moisturizer within a few hours of applying this one. The texture of it was pleasant which is why I gave it two stars.,0.0
This made my skin breakout so bad. I was really gonna like this but I got disappointed! I think it’s still a good product tho because it feel so nice and hydrated on the skin but I was getting pimples everywhere on my face the next day! Just not the best for my skin type,0.0

"I heard really good stuff about this product, so I was really excited to use it. It felt good at the beginning but after 30 minutes my skin started to burn a little around my cheeks and chin..after some more time I noticed these little pimples so I took it off. I’m really disappointed because I don’t have sensitive skin, so I thought that everything could be okay...i hope my skin will get better in the morning.",0.0
I don’t completely hate this product. But it was really disappointing. I feel like it just leaves my lips oily without really moisturizing. I’ll probably use this up but I don’t think this is something I will repurchase. If you have really chapped lips I’d definitely go with another product. This one doesn’t help unless you constantly apply it. And even then it just doesn’t feel good.,0.0
"I have dry skin and I was torn between buying this or the other version meant for drier skin types. I chose to buy the original. I want to love this so much, but it is somehow TOO moisturizing for my skin that it causes me to look oily and get pimples on the more thin parts of my skin like under my eyes and next to my nose. So if you’re worried about it not providing moisture, have no fear! It does feel lovely and it doesn’t take a lot of product to moisturize your entire face. It is legit a water cream. It goes from cream to water as soon as you start rubbing it into your skin.",1.0
You definitely do see an improvement in pores and skin texture,1.0
I will not be repurchasing this. It personally didn’t work for me. Was a little difficult to use and stung my eyes badly.,0.0
"Yeah, this stuff doesn’t smell pretty--but your skincare shouldn’t smell pretty. I use this at night before bed and in the morning, my skin looks incredible!

"I live in Minnesota and if you have ever been there in the winter, you would understand how important a good moisturizer is for you skin. This serum went in so light but the amount of moisture was amazing. I use it at night and in the morning and my face feels so smooth I cant believe it. I have mixed it with the c-firma and is the only way I can use the C-Firma. You can use it under your makeup without it feeling heavy or greasy l, which is a plus. I think it is well worth the price and will reccomend this to all my friends!",1.0
"Nice balm! But you’d have to use a generous scoop full to get your whole face of makeup off. I don’t know, not very budget friendly for the amount of uses you’re getting if you’re going to be double cleansing everyday. You can definitely skimp out on $$$ for a good cleansing balm!",0.0

"Can’t get past the smell. Horrible. Can’t even sleep with it on, even with “good genes“ on top, which defeats the purpose of using at night...",0.0
This product was gifted by Skinfix for my honest review. The cream came in just in time for winter month’s in Montana. My skin can use all the hydration it can get this time of year. This cream feels so rich and nourishing. My skin always feels like it just bathed in vitamins after application. I like how thick the product is because it works well for the extra barrier of protection on my dry patches. I definitely want to continue to use it and I am so thankful to have received this product for testing purposes.,1.0
"The bottle needs to be redesigned as too much product gets easily squeezed out.  Cleanser did an average job, nothing special.  Not worth the price and won’t repurchase.",0.0
"All transparency? I did receive this for free to try but that has zero sway with my opinions and experiences. I wouldn’t say I have sensitive skin per say but I still actively choose to be picky about what goes on my skin. I definitely wish this didn’t have coconut in it but aside from that, here’s what I think:After about a week of using it, my face genuinely does feel smoother, softer, and overall clearer. My biggest issue lately are my pores and I definitely feel they’ve shrunk a lot. It’s the perfect amount of abrasion to leave your skin feeling brand new without feeling like you used a sheet of sand paper. Cost wise? It’s probably worth the splurge if you can swing it. I, of course, would try the travel size first but I feel like you’ll love it either way. A little goes a long way so I have zero doubt this will last for quite a awhile.",1.0
This sunscreen looked amazing on my face but it broke me out horribly. It has niancinimide in it which may not be the best for sensitive/acne prone skin. Such a shame. I’m going to have to return this product.,0.0

I noticed that it made a huge difference in my skin the more I used it, especiallymy pores. I’m definitely obsessed.",1.0
Tingles in a good way! I wake up with better skin after using this at night,1.0
"By far the worst cleanser I have ever purchased. It says it removes makeup etc, but I will use it three time in a row and it doesn’t take off my mascara and barely takes off my bronzer. It leaves an oily residue, which I guess prevents your skin from drying out, but it also makes it hard to wash off.  That squeaky clean feeling.... not to be found with this cleanser. I would not recommend it unless you have dry skin and don’t wear makeup. If I could leave a zero, I would.",0.0

It’s my new favorite moisturizing cream. It’s expensive but a little bit goes a long way and will last a good amount. I like the rose scent and how it feels when I apply it on my face. It’s also lightweight so my face doesn’t feel sticky after application.,1.0
"Complimentary from Drunk Elephant Ecomm. This is my first Drunk Elephant product and I’m drunk with excitement! I’ve never had a face product where you combine the ingredients before use, until now. I would say that helps keep the ingredient fresh. I washed my face and added this lovely serum. There was no scent. It isn’t exactly watery, and isn’t exactly oily. It is somewhere in between. My skin feels and looks and feels moisturized after application. I’m very excited about this product! I’m enjoying all the benefits that the C-Firma Fresh Day Serum has to offer. My skin feels firm, as well. Under make-up this would be perfect for a firm look. The packaging is gorgeous! Would recommend!",1.0
"this product was sent to me for free to review it. I honestly think that it’s not worth it for the price, i have dry sensitive skin and after i removed the mas i noticed some little pimples on my forehead which was very weird to me because i never get acne but i don’t know if it was caused by the mask or something else that’s why i’m giv It 3 stars",0.0
"It’s been sometime since I ’ve started using this toner, so these are my thoughts about it.First of all, the packaging, how lovely and cute is it? sooo pink and girly.Then comes the smell, although, in general I don’t like fruit smell in cosmetics, this one is soooo nice!The texture is lovely, too. I like such texture more than lotions.It really tightens the pores, I can already see the results, and also it moisturizes sooo well, that sometimes I just use it without any other hydration.Don’t forget the fact, that it is clean at sefora, it is also a great plus.So, you can understand that I am completely in love with this toner . I recieved it complimentary from Influenster.",1.0
If you have oily skin this as a first step in double cleansing is a must need!!! After 3 days of using it I noticed so many of my pores were starting to unclog.,1.0
"This product definitely made my skin smoother and slightly brighter. My skin felt clean as well. After using it for a few months the acne on my face progressively got worse.  I think the formula was too aggressive for my skin and in return broke me out. I gave it 3 stars because it made my skin glow and feel clean, but was a no go for me.",0.0
"I really wanted to love this product, but it makes me breakout badly every time I use it for a few days or more. I used this for 2 weeks and then noticed my face breaking out. So I stopped using for a week and I cleared up. And just to be sure, I started using this again for about a week with no other skincare product changes. Sure enough, my face broke out again. I love the feel of this on my face and the beautiful glow it gives me. I love how it looks under makeup. But i can’t use this due to it causing red, painful bumps. I use retin-a and spiro on the regular for years now, and this still made me breakout. Maybe this is good for someone who doesn’t have sensitive skin, but unfortunately, this is a no-go for me.",0.0

"This stuff is amazing! I’m 35 years old and have been using medium-harsh products since I was 15. Mostly over the counter stuff, and chemical peels on occasion. As a result my skin is pretty desensitized to common anti aging and acne ingredients like glycolic acid, retinol, salicylic etc. I have combination/oily skin. I don’t have wrinkles but my large pores are starting to make me look old (imo). Wearing makeup is the only way I can control sebum production. If I go makeup free (since I’m now working from home I have been doing so often) my face will get oily a few hours after I wake up. I used this product for the first time before bed and the next morning my skin wasn’t oily at all. I didn’t wash my face the next day for several hours and my skin was never shiny. Just soft and matte; not tight or dry. This evening I went out, full makeup, had a glass of wine and after a lovely evening my skin still wasn’t oily! I never thought it was possible! I just bought a $200 serum because I am insecure about getting older but this product was delivered first so I went ahead and tried it. Honestly, my skin looks more youthful simply because my pores look smaller. Its burned onto my brain that you can’t make your pores smaller and this product hasn’t changed that fact. However, because this product keeps my skin matte and soft, my skin appears smoother. Im very impressed. I wasn’t expecting much. This was just another purchase; mostly to make myself feel better emotionally. But, I hit the jackpot!! Great buy!",1.0
Love this moisturiser. Does the job and skin feels soft in the morning. Definitely going to buy again!,1.0
"I’ve used a couple containers of this, and it did absolutely nothing to improve my skin. It left my skin lacklustre, dull and dry in places as well. I’m giving it 2 stars because at least it didn’t cause eczema or severe breakouts like some other products have for me. For almost $100 though, I absolutely would not recommend this product to anyone. There are so many better and more reasonably-priced options out there. Avoid!",0.0

I purchased the original (pink color) hoping that it would solve my problem of super dry chapped lips and have loved it! I use it every night and in the morning while applying make up for hydration before applying my lipstick. I came across with these a couple of weeks ago and wanted to try it...i may say they are both amazing!!!!!i use them for overnight mosturizer for lips and use the lipbalms that i also have in different flavors during the day...its a little pricey side but worth the purchase and they last a long time too!,1.0
