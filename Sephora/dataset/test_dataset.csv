The best primer/sunscreen for all ages.  I use it and my 13 year old daughter uses it too.  It doesn’t clog your pores and leaves a smooth matte finish.  I wear it under my makeup.,1.0
I received this product as a free sample from Pinchme. It was really a great product. It does exactly what it says it will do. It smells awesome.,1.0
I have combo/oily sensitive acne-prone skin and have tried every sunscreen under the sun and have been giving this sunscreen a fair shot all summer long. PROS: truly lightweight! It feels like vaseline when it comes out of the tube but once it’s on you don’t even notice it and dries down pretty matte. I can get pretty teary-eyed when it comes to sunscreens and this did not make my eyes water. No white cast and minimal greasiness. No pilling. A little bit goes a long way. CONS: Made me break out badly especially on the cheeks but I kept using it because of the price and because I was excited that it was so lightweight. This was my first supergoop product I’ve tried so maybe the other ones will be better.,0.0
In the winter my lips are always so chapped no matter what lip product I use on them. This Drunk Elephant lip balm changed my lips! I will definitely be stocking up on this when I run out!,1.0
"Given the great reviews and the fact that I love Tatcha, I had high expectations for this essence. I’ve been using it for several weeks now and have not noticed any significant changes in my skin. This product provides some instant hydration, but it wasn’t long lasting. I haven’t noticed any improvements in my skin tone or texture. My skin is normal to dry. I’ve observed better results with heavier textured essences.",0.0
"I’m not sure if this product was just overhyped for a beloved YouTuber or if it just didn’t mix well with the chemistry of my skin.  But it dried out my skin within within minutes.  I tried this every other day for 2 wks and the same result each time.  In fact, it made me look older and I swear it looks like it darkens my skin tone after about an hour or so of putting it on.  I tried using it as an overnight mask and I woke up with dry skin (and accentuated wrinkles I didn’t even know I had!  I wanted to love it so I kept trying to see if it would eventually work out and give me some good results but, unfortunately, I’m going to have to return it :(",0.0
I received this product as a free sample. This is a very thick product and it goes on smooth but if you use too much product it gets hard to move the product on your face and neck. It takes a lot of effort to rinse the product off. Feels like it leaves a film on your skin. Do not like the smell of it. smells stale.,1.0
This is a calming cleansing balm that is a perfect first step for a double cleanse. No offense scents or coloring. The price is excellent.,1.0
"I am in LOVE with Glow Recipe’s brand new Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50!!!Sunscreen is a must in my daily skincare routine, I am always looking for sunscreens that work not only on my face but also on my husband and son (and they are a tough crowd!).The hybrid mineral and chemical formula applies like moisturizer, blending smoothly into my face without pilling or leaving a white cast. It’s got the signature Watermelon Glow scent and packed with niacinamide to brighten & even skin tone, hyaluronic acid to hydrate, and aloe to soothe the skin. My son also noticed how easy Glow Recipe’s lightweight formula was to apply on his face before school unlike other pasty sunscreens while it blended easily into my husband’s bearded face. They were both pleased to go on about the day without greasy feeling skin.I love how Glow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50 gives my face a dewy glow.  Makeup applies well over this moisturizer-like sunscreen though I am just as happy to leave my bare sun protected face shine through.I’ll definitely be buying more when I run out, two thumbs up from me!",1.0
"I was so sceptical before trying this product but it is so great. I love that it dissolves my eye makeup while also cleansing my whole face. I like to use warm water and make sure to rinse VERY well, especially around the eyes. It removes everything. I follow up with the rest of my routine (toner, face oil or serum, moisturizer) and I haven’t had any difference in breakouts since introducing this balm into my routine. Just glows hydrated skin :)",1.0
"The color, the smell, the feel! I love this mask. Leaves my face feeling refreshed and smooth.",1.0
This mask is by far my new favorite face mask! I absolutely love how I can see a tremendous difference after one use. I’m so happy I received this product complementary for testing purposes before it was released because I have been taking about this to everyone I know. I can visibly see my pores shrink along with having a brighter complexion. It helps even the redness from the summer sun and leaves my face as smooth as a baby’s butt! 10/10 recommend!!,1.0
"If you have the time to leave on for 30min to an hour, you’re pores will be crystal clear! Even after that long, it didn’t dry me out! LOVE",1.0
I really like this mask. It cools while it’s on and you can actually move your face unlike other clay masks. It’s a little bit hard to get off (I get blue all over everything) so use towels you don’t mind getting dirty. I felt refreshed after and could notice my skin was less oily and felt smoother. When it says to be careful going in the sun ADHERE to that advice. I didn’t burn but my skin peeled a little in some places after going in the sun. Overall I would recommend. It’s a great prpduct.,1.0
"Does everything it says it will do. I have combo acne prone sensitive skin. My skin breaks out to almost every product i try and i get clogged pores easily. I actually bought this product about a year ago when i was going through it with my skin and after the first night it made such a huge improvement on my texture and dry patches. It minimized the size of my acne too. I used to switch between this product and my curology so i used it every other night. I used it for a while and stopped when my skin got cleared up. Now a year later and my skin is acting up again with random dry patches and acne. After the first night of using it again my skin is so smooth and looks so much better. It does make my face feel warm but it doesnt irritate my skin. You have to follow instructions and be careful with the other products you use along with it. Whenever i use this i dont use any other strong products, just mild cleansers and moisturizer. I try to keep the rest of my skincare routine simple and clean because i find it does the job better that way. (I also used to shave my face and noticed my skin was irritated from that and trying so many products to calm it down) * photo is from last year when it was at its worst, second photo is from a few weeks ago with no make up*",1.0
I like this one better than the laneige lip mask. Tatcha’s formula is light weighted and very moisturizing.,1.0
Did not like. Made my skin feel tacky. Felt like it never absorbed into my skin.,0.0
"I always enjoyed this product, but didn’t really feel any changes to my skin. That is, until I ran out. My skin was SO much dryer, and I realized how moisturized the grape water face mist kept my skin. This is a staple in my cabinet and I don’t go anywhere without it!",1.0
excellent moisture helps to give and even skin tone gets rid of the mars on the face feels great and little goes a long way  one pump and your whole face is  covered.,1.0
"The serum feels great on the skin. Once applied my skin felt fresh and the product was absorbed by my skin quickly. Also my skin was soft after using, and the scent of the the serum is acceptable. I personally really liked the scent and texture which is liquidy. I received this product in the travel size for complimentary testing purposes. I hope to buy when I can afford it.",1.0
"First got a sample and ended buying the jar. It’s amazing for evening out general uneven skin tone associated with redness. Smells fine, lightweight and love that it’s got SPF without the pungent SPF smell. I actually use this instead of my tinted moisturizer and foundation during the week. But do note that this is not a concealer so it’s not going to completely cover dark breakout spots.",1.0
"I looove this serum. After using it I feel like my skin tone is more even, that my skin looks more plump. I feel like a lot of my tiny fine lines around my mouth and eyes are gone after using this which is a HUGE deal for me. It goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn’t leave behind any type of residue. I really like it and plan on purchasing it again.",1.0
Only good thing about it is its hydrating. But its too sticky and doesnt do anything. Prefer timeless matrixyls serum,0.0
"Really like this product, it works great and highly recommend it. However, the price tag is a little hefty. If you are in the market to splurge on a good primer, go for it.",1.0
"I really do love this, but you need to follow up with a face cleanser",1.0
This product is very nice!! It doesn’t really have a scenr to it pretty neutral to me and its super smooth and easy to apply!! I love how healthy it makes my skin look right after applying!! Don’t even need to apply moisturizer when I use this!!,1.0
"If you have dry skin, this ones for you. I have combination and I breakout once in a while. Used this for like 3 weeks. It broke me out and my skin was more oily in days.",0.0
I don’t think this product did anything. No cooling effect. No de-puffing. Disappointed.,0.0
This stuff feels so amazing on my skin! The smell is nice and clean; it feels like I’m legit putting something healthy on my skin. Love that it is oil-free yet highly moisturizing!! Will definitely repurchase again.,1.0
"Oddly enough, I hadn’t used many Origins products until I received it complimentary in my Influenster Voxbox. I was pleasantly surprised. The texture: amazing! The smell: amazing! The results: amazing! I’m a fan and repeat customer now.",1.0
"Absolutely stunning! It’s like a bronzer and glowy spf primer in one if you have light-medium skin. If you have medium-dark skin, it’s glowy with no white cast. Love this formula. Going to be a staple all summer long.",1.0
"I love it, I put it only at night and in the morning my skin looks beautiful and smooth. It has definitely helped me with hormonal and shaving acne. It clears out breakouts. Highly recommend. The bottle itself is really cute. And smells amazing",1.0
glowrecipe kindly #gifted me their brand new “watermelon glow dew drops” - after I completed my skin care routine I added these drops on top & they gave me such a dewy & smooth look to my skin. They apply so well on their own or for under your makeup! By applying them under your makeup it really gives you such a gorgeous glow & helps with the longevity of your look! They absorb into your skin so quickly & make your skin feel refreshed. Definitely buying this for everyone I know this holiday season,1.0
"I really love this serum. The scent, the feeling in the skin, the packaging - it’s all great. I love gow it feels on my skin and it’s super hydrating but I feel like I will go through the product very quickly and it is very expensive.",1.0
I’m obsessed with this moisturizer it’s super smooth on the skin and I love that it’s not too watery and doesn’t leave a cast on the skin which is important to me! Definitely a product I’ve been using in my skincare routine!,1.0
I absolutely love the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel.This peel is so easy to use and works well on my acne prone skin. I love how soft my skin is in the morning and my face seems to glow after I use them. I generally have sensitive skin but this product doesn’t bother me at all. Always love AHAs and BHAs!,1.0
"This is an amazing product from Fresh! This serum is a game changer!! I love to use it in the morning and before bed time.  This serum give me a  long lasting hydration and smells amazing. I just wish it could come a bigger size, but it totally worked out for me.",1.0
"This product is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used.  I primarily use it under my eyes because that’s where I need it the most, but if my skin is feeling extra parched, I will use it all over.  Easily plays nice under makeup, so no concerns there.  A little goes a long way!  It is on the pricey side but so entirely worth it.",1.0
I don’t normally get breakouts (occasional hormonal acne or the sore red under the skin type maybe a handful of times in a year). I recently had a deep painful spot on my cheek and the first day/night it DRASTICALLY reduced. It’s been a week and this bad boy is almost non existent. Love the product.,1.0
I am so glad that I got to try this! I love it! It feels just like you’re wearing lip balm and than it sinks in and your lips are left silky smooth and soft in the morning! I’ve tried a lot of lip products for dryness and this is definitely a winner! Thanks to Influenster for sending it to me! This was complimentary for testing.,1.0
"I received this product as a free sample from influenster. I absolutely loved this product the first time I tried it. It absorbed into my skin completely and didn’t feel sticky or greasy. The only thing is be careful around the eyes, my under eyes felt very greasy at the end of the day.",1.0
This moisture cream is exactly what I have been looking for! It isn’t very heavy and hydrates my dry skin. You don’t need to use that much of it for it to cover and do it’s job. I initially tried this product in a trial pack and fell in love with it.,1.0
"The Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is a powder cleanser that transforms into a paste once water is added. It is formulated with rice powder to gently cleanse and exfoliate the skin. It makes the complexion immediately softer, brighter, and smoother. It’s a great everyday cleanser that really transforms the skin and improves any texture issues. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.",1.0
I am obsessed with the glow this gives my skin!,1.0
"Okay first of all, this toner smells AMAZING. It works wonderfully. It leaves a glow like no other toner I’ve used. And let’s talk about all the natural ingredients used!!! This product was given to me for free for my honest reviews",1.0
"I recently was gifted this from Glow Recipe, and I really love these products! I usually try to avoid fragrances, but this smells… so good. LOL. The container is also refillable which I love. 10/10 for trying to be more environmentally conscious!",1.0
"I looooooooooooooove this cream. At first when I opened it and it was pretty firm and not mousse-y; I thought it was a little weird. But when I used it, it was soooo hydrating and easy to apply. It smells soooooooo good. You stay moisturized all day, all night.  A little bit goes a long way as well, you don’t have to apply a huge amount.",1.0
I’m obsessed with this product! It’s so moisturizing and makes my lips feel full and soft but doesn’t leave the wet sticky feeling of a gloss. The color is only a hint which is great because you don’t need a mirror to apply it. The color is buildable so you can achieve a wash of color or build it up to be stronger.,1.0
"I live for how this toner makes my skin feel, but I feel it may be causing me to break out :(",0.0
Made my skin feel and look great! Did not leave my skin oily.,1.0
The holy grail !!!! Use every night followed by spf to protect the skin ! Acne and acne scarring were visibly clearer in just two weeks .see my before and after (just two weeks in ),1.0
"Literal confidence in a jar. I have used other moisturizers before and while they did fine, none of them felt like I had new skin. Literally I feel like I just had my face done with a mask. If you haven’t tried this and skeptical, I understand $50 is a lot, but realistically it goes a LONG way and will certainly help you feel better. If I go a day without it, I feel overly dry and just not my best.",1.0
"This is really a great moisturizer. It feels so lightweight and cool and refreshing! I have dry spots on my eyelids and when I use this they are significantly better the next day. Also it just give your skin a healthy dewy look. You only have to use a small amount, but I Definitely will be purchasing this after I run out!",1.0
I’m a flight attendant so I suffer from tired and dry skin- this is great! I sleep in it after a flight and even use it as a moisturiser on days when I’m not wearing make up. My skin always feels a hundred times better when I wake up after wearing this mask.,1.0
"Just like any other standard wipe, not the best at removing mascara also. The coconut ones have an amazing smell though.",1.0
"I just received this as a sample and cannot wait to purchase. I am currently using the Good Molecules cleansing balm-which is great. But the texture on the face can feel  sloppy, like it’s sitting out top, and not actually melting into your skin, and almost dry. The second I massaged this with my hands, I knew why this received and Allure reward. This r emotes my sunscreen without leaving my face stripped. So gentle, yet strong on my makeup. Cant wait to be done with my GM to purchase this! It also has a fresh citrusy scent that I like as well.",1.0
My skin feels moisturized with this Spf. After applying my skin looks radiant and glowy. This Spf makes my skin stay hydrated throughout the day.  The texture of the product is very thin and reminds me of korean Spf which are my favorite for combination skin. This spf blends effortlessly in my skin without leaving a whitecast. I love the scent as well!,1.0
had a break out from this and exactly the same product as Saturday Skin. I like Saturday skin much better!!!,0.0
"My skin has been strangely dry lately and I chose this as a 100 point perk. Even though this is super hydrating and does provide moisture and a great base below foundation, this unfortunately broke me out. I have pretty skin that breaks out pretty easily from products. I was hoping this product would not cause me to break out but it did. Just use with caution if you have skin that is sensitive to products and breaks out from them like me.",0.0
"I am not one to use a daily toner, but I gave REN a shot when I received a free sample.1st let me say, I don’t use toners because they usually have a strong alcohol smell to them and they typically feel harsh on my skin. REN does none of the above. The scent to the product is light and there was nothing harsh when Appling it to my face. It left my face feeling refreshed and added a little “glow“ to my skin.  This is definitely a product I will purchase in the future.",1.0
Im very picky with face mask and I must say this is one of my favorite once a week mask. I love to use it on Mondays to get my skin through the week!!! its a must and the price point is GREAT!!!,1.0
"I love this balm. I have a hard time remembering or wanting to wash my face a night and this really helps. You start by swiping a bit of the product onto your fingers then massaging it on your face. It smalls nice, takes makeup off and makes skin super smooth. Not too drying either. I highly recommend. Would be surprised if there was a better oil/makeup removing cleanser out there.",1.0
"I am a skincare and self love enthusiast. I strongly believe that an investment in one’ AM and PM self care routine results in positive energy. Additionally, it results in beautiful makeup. I am 21 years old and I have combination leaning more towards dry skin (occasionally.) Thence my skin care routine has one central intention: controlling oil,minimizing pores while supplying moisture and nutrients equally as well. I have had a difficult time finding a moisturizer that provided my skin with balance, moisture, and rebuilding properties. I tried the suggested “water based” moisturizers and my skin would get very irritated by the high concentrations of hylauronic acids. I tried the la Mer moisturizing gel cream and it worked beautifully, but it was not in my budget. Finally, I stumbled upon this product while in Sephora with my sister. I tried it and needless to say, I saw results instantly. My redness disappeared. I know longer felt dry and uncomfortably in my skin. Finally, my skin looked and felt like actual glass. I used it in conjunction with the Sunday Riley vitamin C oil and serum and the caudalie beauty elixir. I didn’t have to wear any foundation for the next couple of days because my skin loved that combination SO much. I use this moisturizer as directed and in very small doses (which I LOVE) and my skin has never felt more controlled, calm, and rebuilt. Furthermore, it is SO soft. I will always buy this moisturizer it is a TOTAL game changer. Combo people, do not be afraid to use this cream I have experienced no greasiness or irritation.",1.0
"This is my one and only face cleanser and I am obsessed. Have used it for years and it’s perfect for my sensitive, primarily dry combo skin. For years I thought my skin was acne prone because I was using harsh, drying cleansers when my skin was actually just sensitive. Once I started using this face wash my skin changed completely. I don’t know about “makeup removing”, I still use a makeup wipe or cleansing balm. But otherwise this face cleanser is perfect.",1.0
I bought the full size after receiving a sample size because I loved it so much. I had been using a scented soap to clean my face but always had a ton of tiny blemishes. Now my skin is so smooth and clear. My dr even exclaimed I had gorgeous skin and asked what I use.,1.0
"I usually hate wearing sunscreen because it feels so heavy and causes breakouts but this one is lightweight, goes on velvety smooth, and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy. My only wish is that it lasted a bit longer so I didn’t have to reapply throughout the day in the Texas heat! Would definitely recommend for those that want a daily lightweight sunscreen!",1.0
"I received a small #freeproduct sample of this serum.  I liked that there was very little scent and it felt nice on my skin.  Unfortunately the sample was so small I cant speak to any long lasting benefits, I may consider purchasing it in the future.",1.0
I received this as a sample so I haven’t been able to see the best results as someone who had for months. I loved the lightness and silky feeling it left. It wasn’t greasy and absorbed very well.,1.0
"I received a sample of this product complimentary from Influenster and Estēe Lauder in exchange for my honest review. My skin is on the drier side as I advance into my mid 40s, therefore I like my moisturizers to give off extra hydration or at least do a good job of locking in moisture. The Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme is a medium thick cream that just melts into the skin, and a little seems to go a long way so I’d go in with less and add more if you feel you need it. My face had a lovely moisturized sheen to it after application but it didn’t feel greasy/oily at all. Also, it is very light on the scent that it’s barely detectable. The subtle scent smells so elegant and rich, almost like a spa, therefore I used this product every evening before bed (even tough it said it could be used in the AM and PM) because it felt like such a zen routine. I loved the feeling of it, and it didn’t break me out at all which is usually the case when I try new creams on my sensitive skin. This cream would be perfect to get you through the coming winter season. I’d say get it if you feel like pampering yourself, it’s worth it. I’ll be adding this to my wishlist.",1.0
"I first tried this when I got a sample with purchase. I loved it then, and now I’m halfway through the jar I purchased and I love it still. It smells wonderful, it really does melt away stubborn makeup, especially waterproof mascara, and my skin feels soft and nourished. No breakouts, and any residue is removed with my second cleanse. It doesn’t take much to do the job, so the jar will last forever.",1.0
"I absolutely love this product! I have super sensitive skin and I have had a really hard time finding a moisturizer i like. This one smells so good, makes my skin so soft and is absolutely perfect. It is worth the money!",1.0
"So I just received this lotion compliments of Influenster. And while I live in Wisconsin and am not traveling due to the pandemic I haven’t had great opportunities to try it. I did open it up and put it on my skin to get a sense of the product. And wow. You wouldn’t even realize you’re wearing a sunscreen. It’s light and not oily. It has a fresh scent and spreads evenly. The best part of this is that it’s ocean friendly and Hawaii approved. When we went last year we learned that many sunscreens that day they are ocean safe, don’t cover all the toxic ingredients just the ones banned. So I love to see a company that is taking a closer look to their effects on the environment. I will definitely be using next summer and recommending this to family and friends!",1.0
"I love my new Charlotte tilbury, the texture is one of the best part of it , when applying to my skin it feels so fresh and soft. Also, the ingredients helped my skin a lot. Looks more healthy, bright and not oily. I don’t know how I could live without it.",1.0
"This is my first time using a makeup remover cleanser so I don’t know if this is normal but this product leaves an oily, filmsy feel after rinsing. My eyes are cloudy after a few minutes because it leaves residue after rinsing.",0.0
"I really look forward to using this cleanser every morning. It has really smoothed out my skin texture and feels very clarifying. The cleanser has the same wild rose scent that I love from Tatcha. I would’ve given it 5 stars, but the packaging is awful! The hard plastic makes it difficult to dispense a consistent amount. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve squeezed too much out and it was really difficult & time consuming to get back in the bottle (not to mention, that’s not very sanitary)! Overall, this is a wonderful product and I will be back to repurchase!",1.0
This moisturizer is good but definitely more of a winter product for me. I have combination skin and sometimes it can be a little to greasy for me. Overall it’s a great product that does work and I recommend it to people who have more of a dry skin type.,1.0
The best makeup remover I’ve ever used! Melts my water proof mascara. I love it and will definitely keep purchasing.,1.0
"I have VERY oily skin, and have found it hard to come across a decent moisturizer. This product is AMAZING, and I saw results in 3 days. I use it mostly as a night cream, but I’m sure it would be great as a morning moisturizer. It’s a little pricey, but DEFINITELY worth the money.",1.0
"AMAZING! I feel like this mask really exfoliates your face, and gives you the clean, smooth surface feel. I have used this about 10x and I still have a lot more product left, don’t be discouraged to buy because of the price, way worth it!",1.0
It is an excellent product for acne-prone skin; just a drop or two leaves my skin feeling nicely nourished for hours without feeling oily. It’s also fantastic with tretionin cream usp 0.025%,1.0
Nothing changes my skin as much as the daily use of these wipes! LOVE!,1.0
"This is an okay product. I got it as a beauty insider reward, because I was looking for a nice moisturizer. This is SO THICK and feels gross. The feeling goes away after about 20 minutes. I don’t recommend.",0.0
"Feels great on my skin, doesn’t leave any cast. Feels moisturizing but not greasy or like my skin feels oily. Very easy to apply makeup on top of, but actually looks nice without foundation on my skin as well. I have sensitive and acne prone skin that gets dry in the winter, and I’ve found this to be non-irritating and haven’t noticed any breakouts at all. I am a daily sunscreen wearer so this is absolutely wonderful for me. I received this complimentary but will definitely buy it again. I used a different Shiseido sunscreen daily in the past and I much prefer this formula.",1.0
"I received this Korres moisturizer for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Overall, it has a great texture and a little goes a long way when applying it. It has a subtle, sweet smell. I’ve been applying it 2x day for about two weeks per the instructions. I’ve noticed a subtle difference in the size of my pores. Perhaps it needs to be applied for a longer period of time to have a significant noticeable effect. My skin gets very dry in the winter and this really helped keep my skin bright, soft, and moisturized. I highly recommend!",1.0
I received a sample of Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel from Pinch Me.  The product made my skin feel great and I like that it’s gentle enough to use daily.  I would definitely recommend this peel to my friends and family.,1.0
"I am so glad I found the scrub that meets my expectations and makes my skin soft and exfoliating. I like the light scent of lemon, this scrub cleans my skin so well that I noticed how better it started to look than before. I like the feeling of clean and exfoliated skin. Definitely would like to try other products of this brand .",1.0
"I decided to only use the dots when I had a really bad pimple or two, but it required wearing the dots about three nights in a row to completely get rid of it. Therefore the dots ran out super fast, even when I tried to not use them much. I only recommend these to someone who has extremely clear skin who just gets a pimple on a rare occasion.",0.0
This stuff is great. Noticed an improvement in my skin after I started using it because I was getting all my makeup off. So much better than wipes.,1.0
"I loved this mask. I like the tingle since I feel like it’s somewhat working. I love the benefits, how easy it is to use, and I did see a slight difference in my skin tone. The morning after use my skin has a nice refreshing glow to it which I was pleased to see. I will purchase this again.",1.0
"I was a bit skeptical as I usually am with a “just add water” product but I was so wrong. I had no questions about the ingredients,  It smells like rice! So I was impressed and relived. Impressed because seldomly can one recognize Individual ingredients by smell and relieved because the scent is super mild. The size of the little grains was a great size to tackle From mild exfoliation to a bit harsher without feeling rough. I started noticing the difference in my skin in about 2 days. It looked brighter and refreshed for much of the day with out looking dry or over treated and tight.",1.0
This product immediately works at reducing puffiness and darkness but can cause dryness under the eye. It’s important to use eye cream to avoid overdrying the eye area which would be really bad.,1.0
"Definitely helped control shine and I am planning on repurchasing. When using the product, a little goes a long way.",1.0
Purchased this product maybe 3 months ago. It’s moldy and smells like literal dumpster juice. Went to go exchange it at TWO different stores. Their whole stock for both stores were moldy too. Don’t bother with this product. Wouldn’t let me exchange as it was outside the 60 days but THEIR stock was moldy in store so clearly this wasn’t a me problem. Terrible service . 1 star is well deserved,0.0
"Quite honestly, the best product I’ve ever used for my skin. I only use them 1x a week and notice a HUGE difference in fine lines, skin taute-ness and youthfulness/coloring. Dr. Dennis Gross really nailed this amazing product. Its like a facial in 2 wipes.",1.0
LOVE LOVE LOVE can’t say anything bad about this. And I normally hate sunscreen.,1.0
I absolutely love this sunscreen. It has a great consistency and goes on easily. It makes my skin feel so soft and never sticky. Works with or without makeup! I have sensitive skin and have not had any issues. This is part of my daily routine now! I definitely recommend trying it.,1.0
This is the best makeup remover I have ever tried! This gets my water proof mascara off the 1st time! With no trace of mascara left!,1.0
I’ve been wearing it since I got it every night I use it as a night cream The smell is very medicinal so I give it four stars because the smell is a little off-putting as for the product itself it is very very moisturizing and I can really feel it on my face without it being too heavy because of it also absorbs quickly All in all this is a cream that I would use in the future and recommend to others and as for the aging effects I don’t think I’ve used it long enough to notice much of a difference.,1.0
"It is super lightweight and smooth, it feels great and blends perfectly when putting it on. I have combo skin and it doesn’t make it any more oily feeling. I had a 7 day trial and it left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. I will give it 5 stars though I do not have long term results yet.",1.0
"I can’t say enough good things about YTTP. Their newest addition, the Adaptogen Deep Moisture cream is a miracle for the dry days of LA. Made from 100 percent vegan ingredients, this stuff leaves you feeling fresh and hydrated. A spa day for your face. Highly recommend.",1.0
"This is a dupe for 166 dollar SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic. This product does contain an effective form of vitamin C - L-Ascorbic Acid stabilized with vitamin E and ferulic acid. L-Ascorbic Acid has been shown to boost collagen production; however, not in this product specifically. It would be great if there were studies on this product similar to SkinCeuticals. L-Ascorbic Acid is highly unstable and needs to be stabilized in the product formulation before we can be certain it actually penetrates the skin and does what it’s supposed to do. Other than that, I think it’s a good product. It’s free of fragrance as I believe all DR products are and is very hydrating. Ferulic acid has skin brightening effect so this product does make skin appear less dull and more youthful. Please note that this is a new formulation of this product where you need to mix the contents of 2 bottles together. Personally, I am not a fan of this. How do we ensure the contents are mixed perfectly for L-Ascorbic Acid to be distributed evenly throughout the bottle? You can certainly do that during the product formulation process in a lab but I doubt we are likely to achieve the same result at home.",1.0
"Was on the hunt for a new cleansing balm that was free of fragrance & essential oils and did some research that lead me to this incredible gem !!!  I can see why everyone raves about it the way it glides on the skin so effortlessly is mind blowing it emulsifies so beautiful and gets all all the dirt,moisturizer and spf off that you worn throughout the day leaves my skin smooth,hydrated and my pores look a bit smaller !!! This is definitely a staple in my routine !!!",1.0
"I was sent this complimentary of Fresh Beauty. This serum has a light milky texture and an herbal tea scent that is absolutely refreshing! It absorbs quickly with no sticky feeling left behind. I don’t feel like 2 weeks is enough to see maximum results, but so far my skin definitely seems more radiant!",1.0
"So I had zero hopes of this working for me... ok maybe I had a little bit of hope but it wasn’t a lot. This actually exceeded my expectations, overnight. I had two pimples both along my jawline that were obviously visible, I put one dot on each pimple, went to bed, woke up the next morning to find that the pimples had drastically reduced in size (slept for about 6-7 hours give or take). Also, removing it from my face was no hassle at all, it came off quite easily. The packaging is great too, inside the box there are 2 bags, so each sheet/strip with the dots comes in their own re-sealable bag (kinda like a mini ziploc bag) which is super convenient when it comes to storing them. It’s a yes for me! Totally worth a try!",1.0
This moisturizer is a lovely texture that soaks into my skin nicely and smells heavenly. It is a wonderful summer/warmer weather cream and has a lovely rose scent that isn’t too heavy. The HA is great for hydration but isn’t transformative and not necessarily thick enough for dry skin.,1.0
"Does a really good job at taking off makeup- from tinted moisturizer to heavy foundation and eyeliner, mascara, and glitter.",1.0
"Love this product! I use it a couple times a week before bed, and I wake up with a fabulous glow. The first time I used it I didn’t notice anything, but after the first week using it a couple more times, I noticed a huge difference. It’s such a nice treat before bed knowing your skin is going to look flawless in the morning! Obsessed!",1.0
I was sleek red to try this product for #Free and write and give my honest opinion on it. So as soon as I recived the product I started using them. I like how easy it is to open them and get the stuff out I used it everyday till I ran out. I like how it helped my skin with hydration gave it nutrition and protection. I found it wasn’t greasy or oily at all I like that it was so nice Yao use on my skin.,1.0
Very light weight. A little goes a long way. Perfect for my combination skin,1.0
"I bought this after having a really bad reaction to a lip balm from Lush. My lips were extremely cracked and nothing I did helped to fix this (I scrubbed, used lip ointment, tried diy disinfectants, purchased expensive barrier repair lip balms etc.). After a month of having dead and dry patches of skin on my lips, I decided to try this sleeping mask. I don’t remember where I got the idea from, but I’m glad I did! it fixed my lips in two days. Now that I started using this sleeping lip mask, my lips are pink, hydrated all day. I only need to reapply lip balm once during the day. it’s amazing and I will be repurchasing this product for the rest of my life!",1.0
"I love it, makes my skin so soft and smells verrrry nice",1.0
"Love this primer. Goes on smooth - definitely a great, lightweight primer. The scent is very nice as well. I do wish this primer had more of a fresh, hydrating feel. But overall I really like and would recommend this primer!",1.0
"I love to use this sunscreen during the summer. It has a skin-like finish and is never shiny. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin and it doesn’t interfere with the way my makeup looks. I also wear it during winter sometimes, butI have dry skin so I like to opt for something with a little more moisture during that time. I highly recommend!",1.0
"I received a small sample size worth about a week of use complimentary from Influenster. As others stated it promised a noticeable change in your skin in a week and I’m going to be honest, I’ve not seen it. it goes on nicely  and absorbs well. I used it right before my moisturizer and needed much less obviously that usual. not sure how to describe the smell but Im not a fan of it. it’s good but not great, and for the price I probably wouldn’t purchase.",0.0
Truely this Squalane + VitaminC + Rose Oil is amazing! Instantly with 1 drop my skin feels soft with a nice glow. It’s  Not greasy or oily at all. It also has a very nice “Rose” smell that is not over powering. I’ve had on for over 24hrs and so far is hasn’t clogged my pores. I have sensitive skin and usual oils make me break out. I’m in love with this product and can’t wait to see more results over time.,1.0
"I bought the large size, after lusting after this product for a few years and having read good reviews. I use it at night after cleansing my face and also in the morning. I am underwhelmed after a month  of use. I cannot figure out what the hoopla is about. Certainly, I see no negative effects, but for the price and the fame, I expected far more or at least something.",0.0
I am absolutely in love with this moisturizer. It is so hydrating and keeps my skin looking so do you throughout the day. It is so light weight but also does the job and is moisturizing with a beautiful glow. Would recommend for anyone with combination skin or dry skin.,1.0
"I find as compared to my other serum/pre-moisturizer products, this does nothing. The packaging is also impossible to deal with and you waste a lot of product. Would not recommend.",0.0
"I love this cream. It makes my skin feel so hydrated and nice, yet not greasy. It also smells amazing and I love the little spoon that comes with it. After using the Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream for so long, my skin became so dry. After switching over to this, I immediately saw changes in my skin. If you are reading this, YOU MUST BUY THE DEWY SKIN CREAM!!!",1.0
"I received this product complimentary from influenster. This primer can be worn alone, or under makeup. I do really love the lightweight feel and loved that it wasn’t oily at all. I did notice a slight difference in my skin, it seemed more evenly colored and some pores seemed smaller. However, for $52, I would expect this to work better than it did. It worked fine with my liquid foundation, and seemed to help my makeup go on a little smoother than if I were to apply foundation without the primer. I do like this product, but will continue looking for a primer that fits my needs better.",1.0
"I love this product. It makes my skin feel instantly hydrated and clean. The smell is also amazing and not overpowering. I would definitely recommend this and I got this product free for testing, but I will be purchasing more when mine is gone ❤️",1.0
I love this cleanser. The smell and the feeling after cleaning my face with this soap is amazing. What I DONT LIKE  is that the pump keeps dispensing product by itself causing a lot of product to go to waste. I love the glass but the Pump sucks!,1.0
"As someone with dry to extremely dry skin, this cream is wonderful! Being in the cold winter months right now, this cream has been one of the few products that provides enough hydration without having to use multiple moisturizers. I love a cream that has a thick consistency but unfortunately they often have trouble sinking into my skin and leave me feeling greasy. This cream feels super lightweight and sinks into the skin nicely. It does leave a little slick feeling but that goes away after a minute or two of patting in. I’m pretty suprised with how much I liked this product as I tend to be picky with my moisturizers because of how hard it can be to get hyrdation for my skin type.",1.0
"This felt good to use on my skin.  It felt like my face soaked it right up every day when I used it.  I didn’t see a huge difference in my skin, but it did feel softer and healthier.  Visibly I felt my skin looked more nourished but didn’t notice any big change in the wrinkles I have forming.  7 days may not have been enough time!",1.0
This is amazing love how my skin feels more bouncy . Smooth skin instantly and my pores look more smaller . I don’t have lot’s of trouble with lines but I do feel my skin nicer and glowing .I really love the packaging too.,1.0
this is such a good product and is one of my staples. It glides on smoothly and the spa is perfect.,1.0
"Amazing!  Completely disappears, matte finish, not greasy, and doesn’t sting my eyes. The one thing to note is that the smell is a bit odd when you first apply but it goes away almost immediately.  Probably because it is not “perfumed” like other products. I have used other clean sunscreens and this is the only one that does not leave a white residue!",1.0
"First impression, super cute packaging. The box looks expensive and the weight of the container is significant, which gives it a fancy vibe. When I opened the container, the plastic meant to separate the gel and the lotion wasn’t doing it’s job. Some of the gel had gotten into the lotion and some gel had also escaped from the side of the jar. The product would benefit from an applicator that comes with it, but since it didn’t have one I used a silicone brush I own. The gel smells very faintly of rose, which is fine for me because I don’t *love* rose scents, so this was a happy medium. I do think the mask brightened my skin but the instructions say not to rinse it off, i find that difficult to believe because it doesn’t absorb into the skin very easily. I rinsed it off and then applied the overnight mask. I loved the feel of the mask, it absorbed beautifully and left my skin dewey and with a natural glow. I recently got some sun and this product definitely helped moisturize my face to retain my tan. Overall I would recommend this product for intense hydration for your face. I do think it needs some instruction and packaging tweaks. I was given this product by Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Hope this helps inform your purchase!",1.0
"I love putting these on before bed and waking up to see all the nastiness sucked out of my skin. They definitely make an observable difference in the size of my pores and loosen up any impacted dirt and oil, which makes extraction easier too.",1.0
Smells super good and keeps my lips hydrated for a very long time. Highly recommend.,1.0
If you have dry skin stay away from this! Smells great but completely strips my skin of all moisture. Other than that it doesn’t irritate my skin or anything so is probably better for oily or combo skin.,0.0
"Placed few mins before lip stick and it causes it to fade and run away.  Placed before bed time and my lips are still tight in the morning.  I have been doing this for a month hoping it has long term results, but no.  It is no better than a good lip balm and so expensive for that matter.  I would have really loved it if it did what it promised.  Will not buy again.",0.0

"gentle enough for sensitive skin, has the perfect little tingle",1.0
I love Plum Plump! I’ve tried other hyaluronic acid products but the’ve all either dried out my skin or made me break out. This is the first one that hasn’t irritated me AND smells good!,1.0
Very high quality. Nice package. It’s really makes the skin looks smooth and makes foundation last longer. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.,1.0
"This product is so refreshing and leaves my face feeling amazing. At first, it feels like any regular face mask. But once you take it off it has a minty tingle to it that leaves your skin feeling so cool and clean. I’ve also noticed my skin looks brighter and more glowing. The only thing keeping me from giving the fifth star is because it did not reduce to look of pores for me. However, it did help end breakouts after using it when I noticed a breakout coming on. I  received this product for complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.",1.0
"So I struggle with rosacea and for years I’ve looked for something to help. This helps a bit, but it does not cover up all my redness. I have fair-medium combo skin and I still see redness underneath. I cannot wear make up on top of it either because it looks caked on. Great product but if you struggle with bad rosacea it doesn’t eliminate it",1.0
This product is a great mild exfoliant. I like to use this before a hydrating mask or doing an extra-hydration skincare routine one or two nights a week. It is good for days when you don’t use another/stronger exfoliant but still want something to give your skin a boost the next day.,1.0
"I absolutely love this cleanser! It has a nice, soft smell and feels fabulous on my skin. It’s gentle enough to use two a day. Love!",1.0
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes! My product was damaged and step 1 had leaked all over, but step two was fine so I used that and loved it! Makes my skin super hydrated and fresh without the product feeling greasy and heavy! I love the scent of the product as well!",1.0
"Fun of face serums in general, this one was very nice and hydrating and great price too!",1.0
"I just tried this microfoliant for the first time and IM IN LOVE! I instantly saw my skin look brighter and smoother, and I think this definitely helped with some blackheads. You can kind of definitely tell this is rice-based by the smell but it is nothing strong. I was actually impressed! 10/10 would recommend! This was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.",1.0
"If you struggle with large pores, and skin texture this will be your best friend. Let me start by saying that I have very sensitive skin and I was a bit worried that it would irritate me, but nope no irritation at all. It clean your pores, while minimizing them. I love it, you will notice a difference with consistent use within a week. Love it.",1.0
Light weight serum. Smell is super light. Doesn’t leave skin feeling oily. Love this stuff.,1.0
"The best beauty product I own. I put it on before bed and wake up with great lips. I put it on after washing my face and my lips are perfect for liquid lips. But the best is when I am traveling or when I am sick, my lips crack and bleed....but no more.  It will last forever.",1.0
"This SPF is absolutely amazing! Not only does it blend right in, but it’s a part of their Watermelon Glow line, which I’m obsessed over. It smells great and leaves my skin with a glowy finish. Glow Recipe can do no wrong!",1.0
"Have acne prone, combination skin and this is the best moisturizer I’ve came by!",1.0
Bobbi Brown gifted meI didn’t know I needed this and now I’m surprised I wasn’t using this already 😂 It has a very soothing fragrance and can be used as a moisturizer by itself (I have combination skin). It grips the markup pretty well so full points on the primer function as well.,1.0

I used it religiously once a day for a little over a month. It didn’t do anything for my acne prone/oily skin.,0.0
"AMAZING! if you have redness in your cheeks this really helps bring it down. It is hydrating but not as hydrating as the Ceramidin cream FYI. If you have redness tho I highly recommend this. Also great for springtime when you don’t need a super thick cream but also don’t need a light cream, it’s right in the middle.",1.0
Love this I recurved this compliments of pinch me and it made my skin look and feel amazing. Skin so clean,1.0
I got these pads in my boxycharm and have repurchased them since because they’re amazing! I use them after my normal exfoliating toner but they make my skin feel soft and fresh! I love them!,1.0
"Let me just start out saying I NEVER write reviews, but this one deserves it! I had my baby 9 months ago and my skin has been a mess since! I decided to listen to all the hype about the product and give it a chance  I’m SO happy I did. I’ve never been this confident in my skin. I can’t even remember the last time I wore foundation and it’s all because of this! Please please give this a try. Photos are about 2 weeks apart",1.0
"I got a sample of this to try. It was fairly small so I didn’t get to use it long enough to see any dramatic changes. However, it did not pill for it to be a gel cream with a slight silicone feel. It did layer well with other products. I have combo dry skin and I did notice that the hydration did not last me all day. Maybe half of the day. I never have that issue with my current moisturizers. I thought the smell was fairly light and not offensive. I just wish it was more hydrating and longer lasting.",0.0
Absorbs easily into my skin and I really love that it has no scent since my skin is usually really sensitive. I haven’t had any reactions to it either!,1.0
It did okay. To be 100% honest I didn’t really notice a big difference. I received this as a free sample from topbox. I don’t think I would purchase the full sized version.,0.0
"Complimentary from Farmacy , I received this moisturizer for review purposes and I couldn’t have been more excited. The name ‘oil free’ itself drew me to the product first. Having a sensitive and acne prone skin does come with it’s concerns of not being able to use most skincare products, but when Farmacy came out with this light weight and hydrating moisturizer, I was excited. The refreshing ingredients like papaya, Willow herb and moringa water ensure that the pores are clear of the excess sebum and dirt . Hyaluronic and polyglutamic acids ensure hydration of the skin. Would recommend this gel cream for combination and oily skin.",1.0
"This product makes my skin feel super hydrated. The packaging is beautiful and easy to use. After application, the product absorbs quickly and the skin feels much softer. I enjoy the idea that this product can work with any skin care product and not just products made by Tatcha. Overall a great product to add to your daily skin care routine.",1.0
GREAT PRODUCT! After applying make sure you add water to emulsify.,1.0
"As other reviewers stated this smells like pickles—specifically, bread and butter pickles (hint: they added cucumber extract to both phases). My face tingled almost uncomfortably upon application of the gel phase, and the cream phase didn’t calm it down until it mostly set, approximately 10 minutes later, and then a cooling effect set in. After setting my face feels sticky and heavy, but moisturized. If you have tough, sturdy, withstand-all skin, go for it. Not sure if sensitive skin types should use this...",0.0

"I love it. I’m on Accutane rn and my skin is crazy dry. I do agree with others that when I wake up, it’s still on my face. Idk if that’s necessarily a bad thing? But it seems to really moisturize my skin, and I like feeling like I can layer a bunch of things and then top off with this and it’ll keep everything in overnight :)",1.0
"Influenster sent me this product for an honest review: I loved this eye cream. I’ve been using it nightly for about 2 weeks. It’s a creamy gel but it sinks into the skin so nicely. When I wake up, my undereye area feels hydrated and comfortable!",1.0
"absolutely love this product ! The beauty advisor in Sephora recommended me this product as I was looking for a cleanser around the store, and im ever so thankful she did show me this! it is not harsh on the skin whatsoever, it’s hydrating, and effortlessly takes my makeup off. although, it does have the strong soy smell, which I don’t very much like but I can work with! definitely going to repurchase :-)",1.0
"Yes, obviously the price point is high. I’ll admit I don’t care of my skin. So I’ve decided it’s time I do. For Christmas my husband bought me a little starter kit by Sunday Riley. I have seen a huge change in my skin. Dark spots have gotten lighter, tester and tone have improved also. Sunday Riley did say starting the end of this month they are going to lower the price of Good Genes. With that and if my skin keeps improving I will be a loyal customer of theirs.",1.0
"I received the product free for testing purposes from Influenster and Tatcha back in mid December. I’ve been using it religiously ever since, 1 pump in the morning, 2 pumps at night for EXTRA dewiness. I will say, because of the salicylic acid in it, I did break out really bad for a solid week or two. I freaked out but as soon as my skin cleared up it was better than it has ever been. I clearly have seen a difference in my skin. I will for sure be buying again!",1.0
This product smells delightful. It makes my skin look brighter and more youthful; it also feels softer yet firmer at the same time.,1.0
"Love!!! Bought this after watching a YouTube review from MUA Manny, and he raved over it so I decided to give it a try. This stuff cleanses your face of mascara, foundation, eye make up everything! I apply it all over my face/ eyes and scrub when I’m in the shower and I was amazed with how well it worked considering it’s a balm! I tried to go without it when I ran out and nothing worked quite the same so I just repurchased. I’d say it’s a good value considering it lasted me several months and I used it quite often.",1.0
Melts all my makeup right off! This product is good for people who double cleanse. I also have very acne prone skin and this has caused me no issues,1.0

Great for hydration yet still getting that clean feeling,1.0
"I have more combo skin and this is the best daytime moisturizer I’ve ever tried, especially with struggling fighting maskne I love how lightweight this is without clogging pores. I went through one jar and decided to try something else but the maskne returned after a couple weeks so I had to go back and now I recommend this to everyone. It’s made more of a difference for me getting rid of stubborn acne than actual acne treatments.",1.0
I really enjoyed this product. The lotion was smooth and not heavy. It also moisturized my skin very well.,1.0
"Thanks to #TopBox, I received this product to try for free. While grateful, I do still get mixed feelings when I receive small packets of facial stuff to try because normally, you need to use such products over a period of time in order to see results. Hence, my review will solely be based on approximately 3 days of usage. The Clinique brand overall is affordable, looks pretty and in the past, has worked well for me. I used these products at night only. I do have a Clinique cleanser which I used first, and then I applied the serum, the wrinkle correcting cream and eye cream – in that order. So, for the 3 days at least, whilst I did not notice much difference, my skin did feel fresh and rejuvenated. I wasn’t overtly thrilled that the smart clinical repair (wrinkle correcting cream) had a LOT of ingredients – so I’ll probably refrain from buying either of these products. Besides, I also just learnt that Clinique is not cruelty free and so, I’ll probably refrain from using its products in future ☹ Such a shame, as I did use to like this brand.",0.0
"I’ve had hereditary dark circles all my life and have given up trying to find products to brighten my dark circles but came across this and it works! I’ve only been using it for a week and have noticed lightening of my dark circles! It stings the first couple nights you try it but it goes away. I have DRY, southeast asian skin and this has really lightened my dark circles. I don’t really have puffiness so I can’t speak to that and it’s too soon to say about wrinkles. If this is results after one week, I can’t wait to see the results after the bottle finishes!",1.0
"I received a sample of this product complimentary for review from Influenster. As much as I loved the scent and idea of this product, it really didn’t work for me. It chapped pretty bad and took my lips over a week to recover. I looked up the price and even if it had of worked, it was way too pricey for me to continue",0.0
"If I could only use one product on my skin, this would be it. I’ve been using this serum for several years, and it’s the first time in my adult life that I feel comfortable wearing little to no makeup in public. It doesn’t break out my acne prone skin, and has done wonders for fading my dark spots and old acne scars. I will say, if you are looking for something with overnight results, this is NOT the product for you. Slow and steady wins the race with this one. You will definitely see results, but it may not be as quick as some harsher treatments may claim to work.",1.0
So far so good! Helping with my dryness on my forehead,1.0
"One thing I love is skincare and oils are my FAV. I was very excited that this product was sent to me. After using this product this week, I really like the scent. I have noticed a difference in my skin tone and texture. It instantly absorbs into my skin without feeling way down. I feel like my skin was instantly radiant the moment I started to use it. I have mixed a couple drops into foundation and love the way it sits on my skin and makes my make-up look great. I would recommend and definitely keep using the product in the future.  I did receive Guerlain Abeille Royale Youth Watery Oil complementary and for an honest review.",1.0

I struggled with acne scars and this mask really helped, however I wouldn’t recommend unless you have this specific issue. if you’re just looking for a regular chemical exfoliant or have sensitive skin, try a bha/pha toner like glow recipe’s or krave beauty’s. while it is a good product, i don’t plan on repurchasing since my skin tone is doing so much better.",1.0

The texture of this is really good, it goes on nicely and hasn’t caused any irritation so far!",1.0
"This is truly helpful with dryness and fine lines around the eyes.  When I come home and remove makeup after work, I reapply this for the comfort and help with dryness/tightness.  Have been using for about two weeks, and already notice a difference in skin, and smoothness under makeup.",1.0
While others say it is too thick for me it was just right.  I love using it and it felt great on my skin.  I even used it after shaving my legs and it worked magic.  Wouldn’t recommend that for every day but my skin was dry.,1.0
"I’ve been using TO’s niacinamide + zinc for almost three years now and was so excited to try this. Sadly, this one didn’t have any effect with consistent use. It leaves an odd non-hydrating, greasy feeling. It’s not worth the price considering it didn’t do much/anything for my skin concerns. It does smell nice though. I’ll use it until it runs out, but I won’t be repurchasing.",0.0
wowowowow last night i did the ordinary bha mask and this right after to combat the drying glycolic acid gives me and i woke up with my skin GLOWING! so soft and hydrated. i had a couple dry patches on my skin and some pimples coming up and this combo made my skin CLEAR OVERNIGHT! definitely get this product for the TLC your skin needs. pair it with the ordinary BHA AHA mask if bhas and ahas work for you! this is my first time using youth to the people and now i really would love to try their other products !,1.0

"Absolutely adore this cream!! I will always keep a backup now, I use it morning and night. Makes my skin so happy and hydrated!",1.0
"This product is a life saver. I have oily skin, and this toner clears my acne and got rid of all of my oil! I was also using the matching cleanser and moisturizer but I felt like the moisturizer didn’t help with the oiliness, so I only use it on my face except in my t zone. I’ve had zero problems since! The cleanser from this line is great too. All of this is perfect for extremely sensitive skin, and I highly recommend this line for someone looking to transform oily acne prone skin!",1.0

"I recently started using tretinoin in my routine, and my combination skin became super dry as a result of it. Nothing would touch the flaky patches around my nose and temples until now! Yes, this product is expensive, and yes, it is thick - but if used as directed (ie warm it up between your fingertips first, and then pat it in), it is a lifesaver for dry skin. Additionally, fragrance usually irritates my sensitive skin, but this one doesn’t. Honestly, don’t knock it till you try it. I’m a La Mer believer now!",1.0
I love this product .it smells really great .It makes my skin look so good and hydrated and softens my skin  .Definitely recommend it,1.0
One of my all time favorite serums. It’s really light weight and feels beautiful on my skin. I use it in the mornings after cleansing. I pat into my skin and it does not feel sticky. I notice my skin is brighter and more radiant.,1.0
"Ive been using this product for a while now and I will never turn back. It is amazing for acne prone skin and hyperpigmentation. My scars are clearing, my face feels better, its not too harsh. Even my dermatologist notices a difference! Vitamins are good for you!! Get this product !",1.0
"I used to HATE moisturizer because it felt so heavy on my skin so until a couple years ago I’d never use it. But my skin has changed to be more on the dry side after tretinoin and I’ve really been dabbling with thicker stuff like sleeping masks and what not. And there’s a lot of products out there that work great...except they’re scented and usually break me out in a couple days because they’re so rich. But my skin has been drinking this cream up especially because the weather has been so cold and I still haven’t broken out even after using this for a week straight. I love the dispenser on this, I never feel like it’s pumping out too much product and the next day my skin feels so plump and soft so I’m excited to keep using this product!",1.0
This product is amazing for oily/acne prone skin. amazing smell that helps you stay matte all day. AHA’s in it also helps smooth skin instantly and over time. Relatively low price point too and comes on its own or in a value set,1.0
"I really like this cleanser, it is a gel consistency and a little goes a long way. My skin feels super clean and smooth after using and I have not had any breakouts. It did not feel harsh or make my skin feel sensitive when using.",1.0
Love it!  This really gets off my makeup.  I do wear a lot of eye makeup and this gets it all off and doesn’t sting my eyes and does not dry out my skin.  I think this will take me forever to get through since a little goes a long way.  I definitely will repurchase in the future.,1.0
Pros: The facial cleanser feels luxurious on your face as you wash your face with it. It smells good as well.Cons: This cleanser dried out my skin! It literally zapped the oil and moisture out of my skin leaving it parched and very dry!,0.0
Great product. It feels great in the skin. The texture is nice. The jar is really pretty as well Charlotte Tilbury products are everything! But there’s magic cream moisturizer has become my holy Grail. my skin never felt so soft and hydrated. Plus the smoothness and plumpness of my skin is the best part! It goes into the skin very easily and there is no sticky residue,1.0
This product is really amazing girls!! Maybe one of the best serum! I use kind of serum also from Ordinary but this one really most effective! I really recommend this acid. It makes my skin really bright and help my skin for reduced my pores!!,1.0
I’m not sure I see much of an affect in terms of glowieness from this mask but I will it’s by far the most hydrating mask I have ever used. I even applied this to a dry patch of skin on my arm once and it was competitive gone the next day!!,1.0
This cleanse is great in summer time! Isn’t too drying but feels like it takes away the day! Great for sensitive dry acne prone skin,1.0
Love the product and the price! All facial sunscreens I’ve used before have a greasy texture and weird smell. This one has a pleasant scent and feels like a regular facial lotion. Highly recommend!,1.0
"The title describes the product tremendously cause it truly is The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb, and not many titles honestly describe their product so I love it for that. But honestly this cream is my go to and for it’s quality it’s worth it’s price, I 100% y’all should go try it out!",1.0
The best hydration every! It works beautiful under makeup and keeps everything look moisturized.,1.0
"This is good and useful to mix with their plain un-tinted sunscreen but nothing life changing. Also I had heard this initially promoted it as skincare product with bronzing effects and along the line it was getting mentioned as “bronzer with skincare benefits“ so I am not sure. Not sure if I would re-purchase this after I finish. Not a must have item for me. I would rather buy the tinted sunscreen for 34 than buying this  plain sunscreen for double the price. Also, after using retinol, if I was using this product, there skin was more sensitive",0.0
"This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter, but this along with my hylauronic acid from the ordinary, kielhs creamy eye treatment, and the aha/bha peel solution from the ordinary has changed my skin! My skin has never looked so plump, hydrated, and clear. My makeup goes on so smooth now and looks dewy.",1.0
I swear I put this on & then 5 seconds later my lips are dry and chapped! Not worth the $$,0.0
Love this moisturizer. My nose was dry and this helped fix it. I really like how it feels on my skin. It has a very light smell.,1.0
"I am so happy that Influenster has put me onto this brightening gel crepe, my skin has been so dry and flaky from this bipolar weather we been having and I’ve been putting this on before I apply my makeup. And my make up literally looks photoshop!! When I take off my make up my skin still looks refreshed and so baby skin smooth. I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own but I am definitely will be purchasing this gel again once I run out!!!",1.0
"I’m a huge glow recipe fan and have every single one of their products! The watermelon line is my favorite, so I was super excited they came out with a sunscreen in their line. The sunscreen has a slight ’sunscreen’ smell to me but it’s must more comfortable to wear than other sunscreens I’ve tried. It’s quite hydrating, without being greasy,  and doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. I know you’re supposed to wear sunscreen everyday on your face, but so many feel greasy and uncomfortable and hard to blend on the skin, so I think this is a great option to try for those who also not fans of how most sunscreens feel.",1.0
"I was very excited for this given all the reviews. Wanted something to help with some dark spots and clogged pores. Didn’t think this did much other than make me super photosensitive and my skin a bit irritated (my skin isn’t very sensitive usually). Also, I find application a bit hard because it’s quite liquidy so it’s hard to just pour it in your hands - I think using cotton would work better. The scent is nice however that’s not really why I bought it.",0.0
Gave it a chance for past 3 months but I see no benefits on my skin. Unfortunately just another waste of money for me.,0.0
"I just got this product and it feels so good on my face! So soft, I love the way it makes my face feel hydrated. I will definitely be buying more of this stuff. Thank you!",1.0
"I would like to begin by saying the cream is a nice consistency. I have oily skin and visible larger pores. With that being said,  it was more like a gel.  It left my skin feeling refreshed and not oily it was a nice base for makeup. I did not see any significant changes in my skin, but I have been using it only for 3 weeks.  I would not buy it on my own as this was a sample given to review. The long story short it is a decent moisturizer for a person with oily skin.  A lightweight gel moisturizer that blurs pores, controls shine and hydrates skin all day using a powerful blend of Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Willowherb Extract, and the antioxidant-rich, Santorini Grape.Korres Poreless Skin Cream Badge#ThatGreekGlow  I received theseproducts for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review.",1.0
It is horrible. I just sprayed it on three different days and ended up breaking out on all three of those days. My skin had pink blotches after applying it.,0.0
Worked as described. Cleaned very well. No issues experienced.,1.0
I not the person to use toners all the time as I am very lazy but I was very impressed with this toner as it leaves my skin feeling moisturize and fresh after and I top it off with the Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Gel Moisturizer. I really like how these two products have rose infused in it. I received this product complimentary by Influesnter for testing purposes. I would high recommend it if you have dry and sensitive skin like mine.,1.0
"Feels great on my skin and soaks in quickly. While I have only been using it a short time, I do feel like it might be improving my skin.",1.0
This product it was very made my face didn’t have pimples anymore i love it so much,1.0
This toner made my skin feel really soft after I used it. It was easy to apply and not sticky at all. The only thing I didnt love was the way it smelled.,1.0
I was recommended by a professional at dermatologist office to give this a try as it’s very light. I’ve been using a PH balancing moisturizer that is a bit greasy. But after one use of this I knew I will be able to keep using it during all seasons. I have extremely oily skin that is sensitive to environmental aggressors during summer. I feel like my skin is being saved the trouble of extra oiliness by origins matte moisturizer. It feels hydrating enough to just use by itself. But I pair it with a tinted gel hydrator containing spf.,1.0
I Love this product!!!!!!. I love this product I never had a serum so good like that and its work very good on my skin and I also love the texture it’s very light and it easily absorb into the skin.,1.0
I struggle with what to give this for a review. I have bad rosacea on my nose and when it’s awful this seems to make it better but I can only use it for 1 day. Very drying for my combo skin. Great coverage because my nose is like Rudolph but I wish it was more moisturizing and no spf. I don’t find it healing either.,1.0
"Not worth the buck. I enjoyed the consistency of the day product on my face - as it felt light. It did make my face feel firmer and softer, however many other products can without the steep price. In addition, o also broke out after a few days of usage.",0.0
By far this is the best exfoliant I’ve used. I was initially skeptical if it really works but I was wrong. After the use I just love how my skin feels and noticeably smoother within a week of use. It has been gentle enough that I have been using it every other night as part of my nighttime routine. Love it!!,1.0
I tried this a couple of times. It’s cute and smells good but it didn’t work on me whatsoever. Didn’t notice anything besides some redness so I decided to stop using it. Not really worth the price in my opinion.,0.0
Improving the eye area is very important to me. I really enjoy the quality of this formula because I’ve noticed a difference in the discoloration under my eyes. They’ve become brighter in the areas that were on the darker side. It’s very hydrating and melts nicely into the skin and absorbs pretty quick. It gives me a refreshing look which I really like it.,1.0
"Didn’t leave me with a glow or anything, but it got rid of some of my dry rough patches which is good enough for me.",1.0
It helps with acne. It’s annoying to remove it but overall it does give you a clean appearance afterwards.,1.0
I received this as a sample from Sephora and really wanted to like it but the smell is completely overpowering. It is so strong that I thought I had somehow received a solid perfume of some sort. We immediately had to wash my face and start over.,0.0

I waited quite awhile after receiving this for free from influenster to review. I kept waiting to see my dark spots lighten. They didn’t. But i still give it 5 stars because it’s the best toner I’ve used. My skin felt so soft after just the first day. And it smells so good.,1.0
"Love this stuff!  Feels so light on my skin. I keep it out of the family sunscreen drawer, since I don’t want to share it!",1.0
"Love this mask!! It really cleans pores, without drying out your skin! I also love it for a spot treatment! I dab this on a blemish at night, and it’s just about gone by morning!!

"I received this product complimentary from innisfree. This is a nice daily sunscreen. It doesn’t have the most SPF, but its generally sufficient for my daily life. The price is good and the bottle is big.",1.0
This was a repurchase. This product is great for days I’m especially flakey or textured but just want a simple cleanse and not my whole routine with tatcha’s rice powder. Love it and will always have it.,1.0
"Okay so to start off the moisturizer does smell very clean and earthy. It Has a calm smell of that makes sense. Secondly, you do not need a lot of it to cover the whole face which is a good thing. A little does go a long way. Now, if you’re only using this during the day, no makeup then it does do well. You do not need to re apply throughout the day. However, if you’re using this and plan on wearing makeup, use primer. I’ve tried both ways with and without. I would be very oily at the end of the day without primer. In my experience, velvety like foundations do well with this moisturizer. If the texture is more watery than it will run with this moisturizer so make sure you set the makeup. As a night cream, you could use it but I feel it’s not “strong” enough for one. I received this product Free for testing purposes",0.0

Not my favorite. It felt like a dream putting it on but I broke out after putting it on and I have never had any issues with Acne before. I’ve seen some great reviews and I’ll be gifting to someone else to try since I did receive it free from Influenster!,0.0
Leaves my face feeling sticky,0.0
Very good at color correcting! But I use retin-a and it’s way too drying for my skin. My friends and sister love it!,0.0
This is so great and after a couple days you can tell the difference. It helps with the light acne and milia I have on my face plus helps me control breakouts. If I don’t use it for two days all of the bumps come back so it really does make a difference to my skin.,1.0
This product works so incredibly well! I had  a zit on my face and I applied the toner on it and by the night when I went to wash my face it had disappeared almost completely! Definitely will continue to use it. One of my favorites and I think you should give it a go.,1.0

"I love this rose oil. I’ve never tried a face oil before because I have combination skin and I’ve been worried it would be greasy and make me break out. This product is light, absorbs quickly, non greasy, and my skin is amazing. I get compliments on my glow and it’s all because of this product!",1.0
"This is, by far, one of the most hydrating bases available. I love that this doesn’t feel like a traditional primer (over silicone-y and congestive). It feels like a lice cream that glides like better and melts into the skin. Does it make makeup last? I don’t find that it does or doesn’t. I do, however, feel application looks 10x better",1.0
"I adore this lip balm.  My poor 52 year old lips needed a change from other “chaptsticks“ I have been using for years.  This improved the skin of my lips noticeably!  My lip color had gotten so pale and this brought back a lot of my natural lip color!  I love it, but I hate it is so expensive!  It won’t stop me from buying more when I need it, thought.",1.0
Love love love this cleanser. It definitely leaves your face feeling  “clean“ and kind of tight...similarly to regular soap...but it absolutely balances my combo skin. I love the smell..like a cup of tea. If that is your thing you’ll love the smell! I received the product as a sample and just bought the full size!,1.0

"Love using this as a first step in my cleansing routine, definitely meant to be used in a double cleanse routine. When I use this first it helps remove all of my makeup including tough eyeliner, lash glue & mascara. I follow up with a regular cleanser afterwards to remove any residue from this balm. I definitely think you get a TON of product for the $ and definitely recommend!",1.0
Love this product. Smells so good just like gummy bears and grape. Super moisturizing and fun to apply.,1.0
"I was shocked with how quickly this product made my skin look/feel great. I’ve tried scrubs, serums and masks without much success prior to trying this product. The lather has a little grit but doesn’t feel harsh and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. I’ve noticed an overall better tone to my skin and reduction in breakouts since using.. My only “complaint“ would be application, just getting used to getting the right amount of powder prior to getting your hands wet to avoid a mess. Overall I’m loving this product and would highly recommend!!",1.0
"A MUST-HAVE SKIN CLEANSER! This is my favorite cleanser of all time and I’ve tried many different kinds. It’s gentle on the skin, eye safe and it smells so fresh. However, if you have acne prone skin, this cleanser may not help with it fully so you may want to buy an acne treatment to go along with it. Other than that, it is amazing and I highly recommend trying it out.",1.0
INCREDIBLE!! Seriously buy it right now. It will leave your lips feeling plump and hydrated. I use this lip mask in my morning and night routine. Can also be used throughout the day. It really makes your lips look beautiful :) I absolutely adore this lip mask and would recommend it to anyone!!,1.0
not the best product. The consistency and smell are very weird!,0.0
I received this product as a free sample through BzzzAgent to try and review. This product is different from other products because it is not greasy but keeps my face moisturized.

I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends,1.0

"I finally understand this “holy grail” status some people give products. And to be honest, I never expected it to be a herbivore product. I am really wary of using essential oils on my skin because most seem to irritate my skin and flare up my rosacea. Also Herbivore doesn’t use preservatives, which has caused moulding issues and recalls of several products. Despite what some want you to believe, preservatives aren’t the devil (including parabens if you actually read the studies done). Anyways, I got a sample of this in Sephora’s clean skincare sample bag and wasn’t expecting much - I have many AHA/BHA products so this was probably not going to do much. I have a skincare routine down that I follow meticulously and while my skin looks pretty good, my rosacea has always never really settled down completely.This mask has gotten rid of any remaining rosacea redness. Including the major flushing I still seemed to get. In just a couple uses :/ I don’t know how, but it sold me on the product and I bought it immediately from Sephora. I’ve had a few weeks to use it now and still having consistent results so I will absolutely repurchase. Bonus is that it’s a fairly gentle aha/bha product and so it keeps my skin exfoliated (although I still use my stronger products on some alternate days). Although if you’re solely looking for exfoliation, I don’t know if I’d start here since the price tag is so steep. (The Ordinary has a great, and cheap glycolic acid toner) I highly recommend!",1.0

"These Peace Out Acne Dots actually work. I suffer from hormonal acne. I was in the middle of a flair-up with a few types of pimples on my face and shoulders. Some were small and I had one huge pimple that was under the skin and red. It didn’t have a head or anything on it. I cleaned my skin, toned it, then applied the dots to my pimples. When I got up the next morning, I noticed a big difference in my pimples. The patches had “gunk” on them and many of the pimples were either completely gone or almost. The pimple that was under my skin had raised, but hadn’t popped. I put 2 patches on the next night. When I woke up the next day, those patches had gunk on them. The pimple had popped and was so much less painful. I applied another patch to area again because it was still pretty red. The next morning it was completely gone. I am really impressed with these and will continue to use these when new acne erupts. I was gifted by Peace Out in exchange for my honest review.",1.0
"If you are looking for a cleansing balm to help remove makeup then do not use this one. For me, one thing I need cleansing balms to help with is removing mascara remaining from the makeup remover I used. I use waterproof mascara and this cleanser struggles a lot with being able to remove any of it. If you want a cleansing balm for sensitive skin and a good price point without it needing to remove makeup then I would recommend this, especially for sensitive skin. Something to note is after I use it, my eyes do cloud and I do feel a slight film after washing with a second cleanser still.",0.0
"This has helped transform my skin to be smoother, brighter, and less prone to breakouts! My boyfriend also uses this to get rid of hyperpigmentation and have a more even skin tone. I use it 2-3 times a week while pairing it with The Ordinary’s Niacinamide and they work so well together.",1.0

I have been using  The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum underneath my everyday lotion. I have enjoyed using serums as an addition to my already great lotion. It’s hard to discern the difference but I think it does give a little more plump and hydration to my skin.

"The only thing I love more than caramel is coconut, so the second this rolled out I knew I had to have it! It is a thinner formula than the caramel version, but it feels just as nourishing and I do not find that I need to reapply more often. I tried carrying this around with me during the day for a while, but with the summer heat making everything all melty it is really easy to apply too much which results in a white cast on my lips. Due to that, I leave this one at home and use it in the morning and night, and I carry the caramel one with me during the day since I don’t have to worry about white cast with that one. Love the formula, love the amazing tropical coconut smell, and already bought a back up! I hope they make it permanent!",1.0

"This stuff is amazing! My skin had been looking dull and lackluster with some dark spots appearing along my jawline and some chin acne, especially near the corners of my mouth. Within days of staring this, I noticed a HUGE improvement. My skin looked brighter and more hydrated and my skin tone evened out. Now, about 4 months later, my dark spots have significantly receded, and my chin acne is completely gone. When I initially received the product, I added a few drops to both my morning moisturizer and my night cream, which was very effective. After about a month, my skin was so hydrated I only use it in my night cream at this point, adding 3 drops every night and mixing them together before I apply. I couldn’t recommend this product highly enough and I was shocked by how dramatically my skin improved.",1.0
"This product goes a long way, and even after using it every night before I sleep for months it’s not close to running out. The smell and color presentation are also very much enjoyed! However, while extremely moisturizing in the moment, I don’t feel as if the moisture is long lasting, and I have to re-up with lip balm when I wake up and throughout the day. Lips don’t have oil glands, so while it’s true that moisturizing products can only do so much, I wish the stay factor in this product was higher (especially for the price). So, 4/5 stars.",1.0
"This enzyme scrub is amazing! It smooths your skin so good, and smells amazing. I love how big the bottle is too. Enough for a while.",1.0
I recieved this product complementary from #influenster to try and review and omg let me tell you that I’m in love!  I noticed a difference in my skin and a glow after just two uses! I highly recommend trying this product and letting it speak for itself and steal your heart all on its own.,1.0
"Very moisturizing while still light on the skin. Nice, simple and effective product!",1.0
I use the night serum wait 5 min and then the Good Genes.  I tend to use med grade skin care but I am obsessed with Sunday Riley.  Worth the investment I will purchase both of these full size when I’m done.,1.0
I’m indifferent about this product. I’ve been using it for a while and haven’t seen that much of a difference. I feel like this would be a great “starter” cream for 20 somethings that just want to get a head start on their cream routines. I can’t say I would buy this again. However the price is unbeatable and a little goes a long way.,1.0
"It smells good but I gotta say, I haven’t really seen a huge difference in my skin.",0.0
"Love the glow screen! It gave my face a subtle glossy look, while being hydrating but never greasy or very oily. It also did not leave a white cast. Highly recommend and will be purchasing again once I run our!",1.0
"I switched to this cleanser about 2 years ago and I’ve never gone back!  It works great for combination skin, leaving my face feeling clean but NOT tight.I can’t really say that it’s had too much of an impact on my acne, but it definitely leaves my skin feeling super clean.",1.0
"I realllyyy wanna like this product because I am in love with tatcha, but it almost feels like it is making my pores larger. However, I have only been using it for a little less than a month, so hopefully in time it’ll get better. On another note, it’s kind of hard to justify spending over a hundred bucks for something that feels like water... but it does make your skin really smooth!",1.0
"Before I start this review, please know that I was the biggest skeptic of toner. I’ve always thought it did nothing and was just a gimmick for skincare companies to profit on. Boy, was I wrong. I’ve been using this toner for about a week, and I’ve already noticed a  difference in my skin. I have quite a bit of dark spots from breakouts, and they have lightened without a doubt. The texture of my skin has also improved, and so far, I have had no breakouts from using this product.",1.0
"I don’t really understand what there is to like about this product...I do use this as a first cleanse, so the tremendously greasy residue wouldn’t bother me if it did actually remove all my makeup. But it just doesn’t do the job. I’m always left with mascara residue after I use this. Don’t even think of relying on this for waterproof mascara. I also think the packaging is just a poor choice for this consistency. In theory, I love the idea of a flip-top tube for cleansing balm. But this formula is so thick it is more impractical than helpful. I honestly don’t have anything good to say. I’ve really been wanting to find an affordable cleansing balm, but after much trial and (mostly) error, I will be returning to Farmacy’s Green Clean. 10 dollars is not really a steal if you can’t use the product for its designed purpose.",0.0
Alright y’all. Just so you know.. I’ve never written a review on ANYTHING EVER. But this mask gives me life. I have incredibly dry skin and whatever is in this is magic. I use it as an overnight mask and I wake up feeling refreshed. My skin has cleared and changed by using this! My skin has never been so plump because this mask gives it that extra bounce. I also saw Marianna use it on a red eye flight so I thought I’d try to be cool like her and do the same... but SERIOUSLY WOW. My skin didn’t hate me and feel gross and dehydrated after flying! YOU NEED THIS.,1.0
"I received this complimentary to try. I really like it after just a few uses my skin is softer. It smells so good, sometimes serums have an overpowering floral smell but not this one. I can’t wait to see how my skin looks in a few weeks. The packaging is adorable too.",1.0
"So I got this a few weeks ago in the mail from Influenster. It was completely free to try out and let me just tell ya, it works SO good. I really see a difference in my skin. I use it every day, twice a day. I can tell my makeup goes on smoother now, my skin looks healthier and overall better. This really works!",1.0
"This product is not worth the hype. It has a STRONG and overpowering smell that I could not get past. Also, the smallest size is hard to dispense the product from, you have to put it upside and tap it into your open palm, and then spread it to your face. A lot of product is lost this way.",0.0
I’m still on the fence about this. While it definitely does exfoliate I find that it is actually making my skin tone more uneven. It is really brightening the parts of my face that doesn’t have any hyperpigmentation so much so that my hyperpigmentation stands outs even more in contrast. I haven’t been using it for that long so I will try to give it till the bottle is done before I give up.. or until none of makeup works anymore..,0.0
Heaven the best one ever. Works great and makes your skin smooth and soft! Great peel,1.0
Amazing product. Does exactly what it says.,1.0
This right here has become a holy grail item in my skincare routine! It has lightened my dark spots and acne scars a lot and gotten rid of texture from my skin. The price point is very affordable too so I will definitely  be restocking soon.,1.0
I didn’t want to love this product because of its price but wow I’m so impressed. Usually I don’t expect to see a difference in my skin in less than a month because it’s simply not realistic but after only a week I could see my acne scars fading. How?! I love everything about it. The smell is subtle but refreshing and the texture is perfect and doesn’t make my other products peel. I’ve tried every vitamin C serums at Sephora besides the one by Josie Maran (it’s next on my list) and Tacha is my absolute favorite. If it’s in your budget do yourself a favour and buy it now! The pictures are 2 weeks apart.,1.0
I get the same results with Wishful Yo Glow which costs less. I get the same results with the Bee Stunning Diamond Buff exfoliator tool. The markup on this is ridiculous. Could never justify purchasing a full size.,0.0
Good winter moisturizer. I would probably not repurchase in future. No scent. That’s good. No major improvement in skin.,0.0
"I was gifted this sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling, and I adore it. This exfoliant is incredibly mild on my skin, which is sensitive and prone to acne. I like that the product lathers up effectively and has no fragrance or parabens. After only one application, my face feels cleaner and smoother. I may now truly need to buy the full size!",1.0
love it! my skin felt so soft! this was a complimentary item I recieved to try.,1.0
This product works wonders under makeup! It lasted all day for me. The product itself has a slight scent and is super smooth when applied.,1.0
"I’ve tried a wide variety of anti-aging creams over the years. This cream- WOW! I love it! It is super rich and creamy with no greasy or tacky feeling. It absorbs quickly and works well under makeup. I’ve used it morning and night for 2 weeks. It immediately softens and smooths my skin. It works especially well in my neck and décolleté, which appear firmer with a more even overall tone. I’m excited to see the results with continued use, and plan to keep it in my usual skin care routine.",1.0
It’s not a bad product but it doesn’t moisturize my lips it’s nice when it’s on my lips but when it’s gone my lips aren’t moisturized,0.0
I have sensitive skin and this gave me no issues. Removes any makeup instantly. Like magic.,1.0
"I’m using this product for over 2 weeks, and so far, it has been a great experience. The product is so luxurious, I loved the packing and the little spatula that comes with it. The scent is good, not strong. The consistency of cream is light, but it tends to leave skin a little oily. Usually, this is a no-no for me,  but  It didn’t bother me at all. It  ads  that you can see improvements in just one week. In my case, after one week, I didn’t see any difference in wrinkles and lines.  However, I felt my skin around my eyes more hydrated and radiant. After two weeks, I started to notice a slight improvement in fine lines and crow’s feet.  Overall, it’s a good product and I’m happy with the results so far. I can’t wait to see the effects after couple months.",1.0
"I wanted to love this cleanser. It seems the overwhelming majority give it 5 stars. It is a cream, but still lathers up which was great and it made me feel like it was getting all makeup and dirt off my face. I recently bought this cleanser, a eye cream, a night cream and day moisturizer from this same brand. I had been using the cannabis oat dry oil for months and loved it so much that I wanted to give it a go and get everything from this brand. After about 2 weeks using strictly first aid beauty, I started getting pimples. The cleanser was the cheapest I got the small bottle, so I eliminated that and went back to my La Roche Posay cleanser. Used all the other FAB products. My pimples cleared right up, and therefore I think this product made me break out. Such a shame, because I loved it otherwise. If you’re thinking of getting any, get the $11 2 oz bottle to make sure you love it. Luckily none of the other FAB products have made me break out. I’m still using all the moisturizers and oil!",1.0
"It smells nice and it feels good on the skin but that’s kinda it. This mask is pricy like all Fresh products, but I never see any major difference in the hydration of my skin. If you have actual dry skin that flakes and peels, I don’t think this will do anything for it. If your skin is pretty balanced, it is a nice addition to have in your routine. I gave it 3 stars because I don’t feel everyone needs this mask nor was I impressed enough to buy it again.",0.0
"Wow. That’s all I can say. I’ve considered trying these for years but shied away due to price. I can’t believe how my skin looks and FEELS afterwards! It’s the smoothest I have ever had and my makeup glides on and stays smooth all day! I’ve only used for a week and it significantly improves texture!! It does sting a bit on step 1 but otherwise I have no adverse reaction (and my skin is pretty sensitive, but I’m glad I went with the extra strength for impact of results). I’m in trouble, because I’m hooked.",1.0
My face loved this face butter! It absorbed quickly and didn’t leave any residue. If anyone is sensitive to smells this unscented product is a great option for hydration!,1.0
"I use these overnight and love that they stay on. I would say they are most helpful for the pimples that added just starting out, or the ones that are red and a sore to the touch (no whitehead yet). Does not leave the skin dry or anything which is good",1.0
Doesn’t work for me..I see a white patch layer on my skin after i apply the product not worth the hype!!!!,0.0
"Bought for face use, but turned out to be too heavy for my skin and just sat on top like grease. I don’t love the smell or colour either, it but it’s not too bad altogether. I tried it next on my hands and I really see the benefits here! I’ll be using it on my hands overnight. I recommend getting the mini size first and seeing if you like it and it works for you.",0.0
I received the free sample of this product on my birthday. And I love it. It goes on smoothly and smells amazing. I layer it under moisturizer at night and my skin is soft and smooth in the morning. I really love how it smells and makes me feel like I’m making a healthy choice for my skin. I’m reviewing this product as a part of a contest.,1.0
Did not like the texture of this serum. This serum was a little irritating to my face. I would rather spend more money on a better product.,0.0
Octoly gifted me GoopGlow 15% Glycolic Acid overnight Glow Peel and I absolutely love it. I removed my makeup and washed my face and scrubbed my face with the exfoliating pad. The smell is a bit off putting but goes away once the product dries. I let it dry on my face and did follow by putting on a moisturizer. I woke up this morning not seeing a difference but when I washed my face in the shower I could feel the difference. There were no bumps or blemishes to be felt. Absolutely wonderful. My face is so smooth. Can’t wait to try it next week as this is a once a week product.,1.0
"AMAZING, I received a trial size that lasted a week or so and I had to buy it. Hydrated without feeling greasy and truly brightens. Love this product",1.0
I recieved this serum from influenster. I love the way this makes my face feel and look. It has improved my overall daily glow. It is not heavy or greasy feeling. I love this serum.,1.0
An amazing moisturizer for oily skin! Super hydrating and does not make my skin feel sticky. Also great that glow recipe has a refillable pack since they know people will want so much more of this moisturizer,1.0
"This stuff is amazing! I noticed a huge difference after the very first try. I received this complimentary from Influenster. I love the fact that it’s vegan and it feels very light and refreshing. It is very creamy and it makes you feel relaxed for bedtime. I have trouble with dry spots and large pores. After the first try my dry spots were nearly gone and my face felt extremely soft. I have sensitive skin, so the fact that it is completely safe for sensitive skin is an added plus! I can’t wait to see the results after 10 days of use. I definitely recommended this product. If you are looking for a night time cream that is also anti-aging, this is the way to go!",1.0
"Overall this moisturizer is average in terms of hydration. I like the gel formula which absorbs quickly and the hydration is nice. It’s refreshing to use after a shower and helps my skin feel supple. Personally, I feel hydration is the most basic necessity in a moisturizer and I prefer it to have brightening properties or other benefits as well. This moisturizer is great if you only need hydration and I think it would work well with combo and oily skin year round and dry skin in the summer months.",1.0
This is so amazing! I love anything with honey in it because it has so many benefits to the skin. This is ultra hydrating and calming to my skin but it doesn’t clog my pores or break me out. It is definitely going to be a staple for me as a fall/winter moisturizer. If you are using products like retinol or chemical exfoliants this is the perfect moisturizer to use because those products can be very drying. I received this complimentary from Farmacy but my opinion is my own.,1.0
I honestly haven’t seen much difference in my skin. This product tightens my skin once it dries and does not irritate it.,1.0
"Love it!!! i have been trying this product for about 3 weeks now and i can tell that my skin feels smoother, plumpier. it more radiant and hydrated!! i am very very satisfied!!!",1.0
"These worked really well. It got tons of stuff out of my pores, it worked really well, but I wouldn’t stop using my mask that I use to also get stuff out of my pores also.  It helped a lot but don’t sub this in instead of your mask, I would use it alongside a good mask.  I also found this treatment a lot less irritating to my face than those peel off strips that stick to and then pull out sebaceous filaments usually are.",1.0
Love this CC crème for its texture and sun protection . Always buy it,1.0
"I really love this cleanser! i love how it isn’t a soap, it’s a cream that foams up as you rub and it left my face feeling amazing!!!",1.0
As a product junkie I don’t often wind up repurchasing items as I love trying new things but when I find something I wind up repurchasing over and over it is definitely worthy of 5 stars. I’ve tried so many eye creams for my dry eye area including La Mer but it has been sitting in my drawer unused after I discovered the Benefiance eye cream. I use this before bed and it is so hydrating that I wake up and my under eye area does not feel dry at all when I wake up. Would highly recommend this product.,1.0
not even sure what this product does for my skin but I know that whenever I stop using it my skin has a meltdown and starts breaking out.,1.0
I was excited to try this product because I have a lot of acne scares on my chin and cheeks. Since the three weeks I have started using this I have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my skin. I will be purchasing this product again,1.0
"I am so happy that I was chosen to receive the Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Creme complimentary for reviewing purposes. I am going to be honest, I do not normally use this sort of thing, but it has been amazing. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and I love the smell!!! It smells just like orange creamsicle!!! Yum!! This product has surpassed all expectations! I love my glowing skin!! #influenster #sephora #olehenricksen #complimentary",1.0
"I haven’t noticed any major reductions in dark spots yet, but overall I like this serum a lot. My skin seems softer and just brighter and more even in general. I love the price point and that a little goes quite a long way!",1.0
Love this in my acne skin! It feels so smooth like a moisturizer but at the same time I need not use a primer. Only one thing is that I need to wait a while before applying foundation else my skin feels hard to tackle.,1.0
"I was looking for something to seal in moisture, before stepping out into low temperature and cold winds. My face stays perfectly moisturized all day! I pair it with a the Milk kush lip glaze for a natural, glowy look.",1.0
"I was so excited about this product. Honestly, I am quite disappointed. It removes makeup ok, but not without effort. It took a while to rub off my mascara, and it is not even waterproof. Afterwards, I was still left with residue under my eyes. Once I tried the balm for a few days I went online to see if other people were having the same issue and I was shocked to stumble upon reviews saying that as part of the ingredients there is polyethylene. I guess I was misled by the “green clean“ marketing.",0.0
WOW! This is my first time trying and it had improved my face texture and pores. With having oily skin it makes me self conscious but this has helped control it as well. I love how it’s gentle for everyday use! I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.,1.0
"I love this ultra-hydrating gentle Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner. A good toner is a critical part of any skin-care routine. This is a balanced, hydrating formula plus it tightens and minimizes pores thanks to PHA and BHA.I love the unique springy texture and fragrance. I really like how my skin looks since I started using toner a week ago. My pores look much tighter. My skin feels softer, looks more radiant and has a bit of a glow. I find this toner to be much more effective than other toners I have used since I see such rapid results..I use this after cleansing in the evening and just pat a bit into my skin with a clean cotton square. I avoid the eye area as directed. I let it dry then I use my serum and moisturizer. You can also also use it in the am prior to using day cream or SPF. This toner is a good one to try.",1.0
"Oh my gosh. This is amazing. I got the full size bottle for free, and I have always wanted to try it but i’m a broke college student, so when I was sent the product to test it i was freaking out. first of all a little goes a LONG way which i love. also after one night, acne scars that i had for years went away. it literally looks like i’m wearing foundation. i stopped wearing makeup to work (partially out of laziness but this seriously helped me feel more comfortable doing so). i LOVE this and recommend it to anybody with scars or breakouts who can afford it",1.0
I don’t think this works better than other cleansing balms I’ve used. It smells awful and you have to shake the bottle so it doesn’t come out liquid. For the price I’m not mad but I won’t be rebuying,0.0
I’ve heard about this product plenty of times but never bought it because it’s expensive. So when I got to try it I was so excited! Unfortunately I think this is one of those products that has results after continuous use for years. After a few weeks of daily use (sometimes 2x a day) my skin looked slightly calmer and I saw less redness than usual but overall it just feels like something I won’t see the results of for years.,0.0
"I received this product free from KORRES and Influenster . The product goes on very light weight which is nice, however I didn’t notice a difference in the size of my pores. Would not buy.",0.0
"The very best for dry skin. I use year round (early 40’s). Probably to heavy for someone younger with occasional dryness or acne. This is my go to for years, as with most of their products. Very dry winter climate in Minnesota. I can tell immediately when I haven’t used for a day. If dry, it won’t disappoint IMO",1.0
#myserumstick #contest #complimentary @tatcha @Influenster  received complimentary for testing purposes.  DM me if you want in on VoxBox.  No strings attached.  Just review.  Definitely hydrated my skin. Can leave shine so I use sparingly and sometimes use foundation to tone down the shine.  Good stuff overall and happy to have it!,1.0
I like it so far! Been using for about a week. I get eczema around my eyes and this did not trigger it so that is a huge plus for me. I think it makes my eyes look a little more refreshed but I also know that for eye creams it takes commitment and time to really see the results.,1.0
"I have been trying this serum for the last two weeks now.  It is a fairly thick serum, so a little goes a long way.  I noticed it has a very light floral-like fragrance to it.  I noticed right away that it made my skin look healthy and glowy.  It wasn’t greasy or oily.  In fact, it was the exact opposite.  It had a matte finish, but didn’t make my skin look or feel dry.  It made my skin feel hydrated.  I don’t have any wrinkles, so I can’t say if it has any affect on that like it says it does, but I do like the way that it makes my skin look and feel.",1.0
This product is amazing! I love that it goes on clear and smells wonderful. It’s not streaky or greasy. Would definitely recommend!,1.0
"As an already medium/tan/dark-in-the-summertime person, does this really do much for me? I don’t think so. I definitely drank the kool aid when I picked this up.... because all of the other reviews are SO positive. I would leave this one for the fair/light skin tone people. Not for this brown girl.",0.0
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes and I love it so far. The scent is pleasant and not to overwhelming. It gives me. Will have to continue using this for a few weeks to see if it helps lighten dark spots or if it reduces pores, but so far I do get a nice healthy glow from it!",1.0
I really enjoyed this cream not to thick or heavy great for combination skin,1.0
"The smell of this cleaner is lovely. But I have been using it for 2 weeks and I haven’t really seen a change in my skin. My hydration has not changed, my skin is not brighter. I recommend as a face cleanser with very general exfoliating qualities, but not to brighten.",1.0
This serum is really good and made my skin feel nice and soft. Thank you Influenster for sending me this product to test out. #complementary #influenster #tatcha,1.0
I carry this around literally everywhere I use it at all times of the day. It’s so soothing and plumps up my under eyes in literally 20 minutes which I love. It’s super moisturizing without being suffocating or greasy and makes a great primer.  It’s the only mask I use when i’m using my Retin-A.,1.0

Writing reviews is not really my thing but omg this is THE best moisturizer EVER. This came as a sample for birthday and no joke the first application made it immediately obvious that this was a game changer. I’m in love love love love loveeeeee. It is 10000% worth the money.,1.0
Luxurious amazing butter! Use it always now and not a thick gross afterfeel. I have received this as a free gift from Influenster to test and so happy that I did!,1.0
"I really like the packaging of this product. Beyond that, it has a nice tan consistency and does not make my face greasy throughout the day, but also does not dry it out. Percent of it is not overpowering which is important because I get migraines for certain smells. The only reservation I have is the price, but if that’s not bother you I would recommend!",1.0
I am over 50  with combination skin which tends toward dryness especially during season changes. I slather this product on at bedtime and wake up with glowing soft skin. Highly recommend giving it a try.,1.0
"The only face moisturizer I’ve used that doesn’t feel sticky, but still leaves me with a natural glow. Doesn’t clog my pores or break me out! Also makes my foundation look flawless.",1.0
I actually really like it it does it says granted it’s a little irritating to get out like the dropper or pump sometimes but your skin is gonna look good and so I think it’s worth the hassle,1.0
"I’m a skincare junkie, have been one since I was in my teens. As I reached my 40s my skin that was once oily has started to go dry. I have tried so many products to keep my skin hydrated and this has improved the condition of my skin along with other products from The Ordinary. I’m absolutely hooked!",1.0
I tested this out with a sample I received from a Sephora employee during a recent visit. I was concerned that it would make me break out because I have an oily T zone. I was surprised by how soft and supple it left me skin and no break outs!! I decided to buy the full size version. Its great at melting eye mascara off. I’ve always struggled to get that stuff off since I use a primer with my mascara. I used to be left with raccoon eyes even after using make up wipes.  This is a definite must have for make up users with all skin types!,1.0
"I’m not sure what’s going on with this. I use this to remove my eye makeup, and every single time I use it, I get pimples underneath my eyes. Not styes, but clusters of pimples. And I use a normal cleanser afterwards too. Maybe this just doesn’t work for my skin, but I’m really tired of having people ask me “what happened to your eyes?” and being unable to wear mascara for days after using this. Back to micellar water it is.",0.0
Absolutely love how buttery the texture is! It’s definitely a new fave!,1.0
"This is very balmy but gets all of my makeup off easily (even heavy makeup). You do need a cleanser to follow up with. I’ve been looking for a fragrance and plastic free cleansing balm and this is the jackpot. The price is amazing, but I will admit the packaging isn’t the best, it is a little difficult to squeeze out of the product at first but gets easier over time. Highly recommend !!",1.0
This contains PHA and BHA which helps gently exfoliate skin and pores. The toner had a lightweight texture that can be easily layered. After using this my skin looks glowing and feels soft. I like using this at night,1.0
My only complaint is the price tag...it hurts my wallet but at the same time worth every penny. It’s a love hate relationship. I was one of those super oily skin types but actually had dry skin so my face was doing overtime with the oil..plus acne prone so it sucked. This was the first moisturizer my skin loved! It really feels like water when applying and is just the perfect amount of moisture to balance out my skin. I love this moisturizer so much it’s insane how much it has changed my skin’s oiliness/dryness.,1.0
"As a mother of 3 I often find myself feeling tired. I love using face masks, specially at night after a long day. This jet lag mask can be used as an overnight mask and even as a hydrating primer before makeup for those with super dry skin! How cool is that?! Some things I loved about this mask were that it has a thin consistency even though it is also hydrating. It does not leave your face feeling heavy and as someone with combination skin I appreciate that. I can feel a slightly cold sensation after applying which gives that instant wake me up feel, specially when you’re really tired. I also love that it doesn’t have a strong scent to it and it can be left overnight or you can blot with a warm cloth without the need to rinse. So if I accidentally fall asleep with it on there is no problem. If you do have some oils on your skin I suggest rinsing it off once you wake up or before your makeup routine because it won’t go well with your foundation. The only thing I dont like is the packaging because it loses its shape. Other than that I really enjoy this mask!",1.0
"I love this dreamy cream to oil texture. It has so many uses for the face, body, lips, and eyes. It can transform your makeup products and heal your skin too. It feels amazing and moisturizing on the skin.",1.0
"I realized much later from a derm that vitamin C is an ingredient that should be in a light-tight bottle, preferably with a air-tight pump release and for that reason, this product is a 10. Overall I have noticed a slightly brighter complexion but no huge changes other than that. This product is light enough to layer under other products if you so wish. I’ve also had no averse reactions in the few months I’ve been using it even with my very sensitive skin. It is the first C serum I’ve tried and I’m sure I’ll keep experimenting but I’ve been overall really satisfied with the container design and formula as this product as an introduction to vitamin C serums.",1.0
"I LOVE this oil!  I wish they sell it by the gallon.  it makes my skin soft and even lighten my hyper pigmentation.  Love, love, love!  the price is high but the way my skin looks and feels, I got to have it always.",1.0
"I received this Complimentary from goopbeauty. This was so easy to use as you take it from the package and apply the presoaked pad on your face, neck, shoulders. You do not even need to rinse it off and want to leave it on overnight. In morning rinse it off and my face felt so much better after using this. You only need to use this once a week. I didn’t have any tingling upon use of this. However some may experience it.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.",1.0
this product was gifted to me in exchange for my honest review. i absolutely love this product! it makes my skin feel super soft and i only use it 2 times a week! it’s very much worth the price and i recommend this to everyone!,1.0
"I absolutely love this cleanser!  It’s gently yet effective and fantastic at removing light makeup.  My face never feels dry or right after washing morning and night.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars is due to the packaging.  The plastic pump leaks and I always find product down the side of glass bottle and on counter.  In addition, I don’t like that the container is glass.  I do appreciate being able to recycle it, but it is not safe with children and elderly people on household.  More than one bottle been dropped or knocked over and broken in the shower or on sink.  Would love it if cleanser came in flip top recyclable plastic bottle.  Safer and easier to dispense without leaking.  I’ve gone back the DE Bestie cleanser because of better packaging, but like YTTP better.",1.0
My ride or die mask. Been using it for years. Bought it when I traveled weekly for work—continue using it 2 years working from home,1.0
literally melts makeup off like creamy butter and even rinses off like nothing. i’m acne prone and this product only helped my skin while feeling amazing!,1.0

"I want to hate this, and yet, I can’t. I received a decent-sized sample as my bday reward, and I was genuinely hoping it would suck so I could move on with my life and not be tempted to buy this $70 moisturizer. But of course, it was just as amazing as everyone says. I just can’t swallow the price, and for that reason, I’ll keep searching for my HG moisturizer.",1.0
heave in a jar!!!!! I live for this product! Doesn’t leave your face greasy and is super hydrating! Great for combo skin!!,1.0
"I really liked this. Viscosity was awesome, not watery at all. My skin looked glowy and plump using this.",1.0
"I loooooove this cleanser! I’ve been on the hut for a cleanser that helps my combo/acne prone skin and this really awesome. It doesn’t dry out my skin, yet it helps clean my oily areas. it’s also calmed down my acne -- I think I was stripping my skin before.",1.0
"It’s okay...not great though, just okay. Hydrating but not the penetrating type of hydration.",0.0
Yes! Yes! Yes! Absolute fave right now!! Do not sleep on this!! 10/10,1.0
"Although I was not pleased with this cleanser, I’m sure not all Inkey List products are bad. The consistency looked like a gel, it was definitely a balm but, did not do much for my skin or did not feel so much clean.",0.0
I love it - it’s refreshing and gives me an incredible glow!! I feel like my skin almost looks better without makeup.,1.0
This is one of the best eye creme I ever used. My skin absorbs it fast. And what I loved about it you can use it under your make up. I use it daily day and night. I highly recommend this moisturizing eye bomb!,1.0
"I’ve been struggling with dry peeling lips for years & this lip mask is a game changer. I wear it at night & even during the day & my lips have never been more hydrated and soft, not to mention the vanilla smells great. 10/10 would recommend.",1.0
"As a self proclaimed heavy handed person, I cannot empathize enough how LITTLE you need to use of this product. If you use what you would normal do you will because a greaseball. This stuff smells, great, makes my skin look smooth and will last a long time for how small of an amount is needed daily. I’m really happy I bought it, I love Farmacy products.",1.0
I found this product moisturizing without feeling too heavy on the skin. I have sensitive skin and I didn’t have any reaction at all. A very nice product.,1.0
"this lip balm is AWESOME! it is not super sticky and glossy, and most importantly, it doesn’t leave that white crease that most lip gloss does. it smells really nice and not overpowering. i normally don’t splurge on lip products but after seeing some great reviews, I decided to give it a try. definitely one of my favorites!",1.0
I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review. I received a sample size. I’m really surprised by how good this moisturizer is. I assumed it would be greasy like many others I’ve tried and this one was not greasy at all! It melted into my skin like butter but non greasy. My skin absorbed this quickly as well. My little jar lasted me a whole month asI really only needed a tiny amount for my whole face. I have oily skin and most creams make it worse but this one was nice. This has a nice light powder scent that’s not over powering at all. It’s smooth and rich but melts into the skin well. My skin feels much for hydrated after using. I’m looking forward to picking up a full size. If you have similar skin as me I highly recommend trying.,1.0
"I absolutely love this product. It was gifted to me byDermalogica Sampling! After using it, it made myskin feel so smooth and soft! I was amazed afterusing it and i’ve only tested it out a couple of timesnow. I am definitely going to buy the full product sothat I can use this micro exfoliant every day! I lovehow this product is also not stripping my skin andrather it is very soft and gentle on my skin. I wouldrecommend this product to anyone!",1.0
"I received a trial size of this and tried it out maybe five days ago. I’ve already ordered the full size item (two in fact). This lip mask is AMAZING. My previously dry, chapped and peeling lips are now perfectly soft and no longer dry, chapped or peeling. AND I wore it while I was out shoveling in -27 degree wind chill weather this weekend and my lips did not suffer one bit. I LOVE it!",1.0
"Loving it so far! With vitamin C serums you do need to give them time to work their magic but so far, after only a few applications, some of my old acne dark spots have lightened and my skin feels soft all day after using in the morning. I can’t wait to see the results after several months of use.",1.0
"After a few weeks I can say this is quite a nice serum. I stilll want to give it some more time to really see if I love love it, but so far I am really enjoying it. Not a super strong scent, absorbs nicely into the skin. Definitely worth a try",1.0
"skin really smooth after use, I did have a little purge breakout after the first time but otherwise smooth sailing.",1.0
"This serum is amazing. I’ve been breaking out recently. Changed my diet. Change my beauty routine. Spent tons of money on other high end products. Nothing worked. Decided to try TLC and honestly in 5 days my skin has changed. No breakouts, post acne marks are starting to fade. I am switching my entire beauty regimen to DE. Already bought the littles to try a little of everything! Give this a chance, it will work.",1.0
"I highly recommend this line. I use the entire Drunken Elephant line. I’m 48 and have dry sensitive skin. It is the only line I can use that doesn’t break me out! Also, other brands will create little milia (miliums) and thankfully, I haven’t had any with this line.",1.0
Very good cleanser helps remove makeup really fast and easy! It leaves your face super soft and actually helps with acne..,1.0
"I really like this moisturizer because it seriously moisturizes your face! I usually use at night because it is a heavy formula. If I put it on in the morning or before I get ready to leave the house, it makes my face sweat so much more because it’s like a layer over your skin. It’s definitely not a “barely there“ skin cream. I have dry skin so I love it at night!",1.0
"I received this complimentary from Tatcha & Influenster. This is such a lightweight, colorless and fragrances but hydrating essence water. Use daily after cleansing, my skin is sensitive  and this calms it. It’s moisturizing and just wonderful. Packaging is amazing.",1.0
"Amazing toner. It really helped control my oily skin, reduce my breakouts, and give me a more glowy complexion. Not only that, but it feels/smells amazing! Do yourself a favour and get it!",1.0
"Nice nice gel texture moisturizer! It works wonders paired with the essence too! It moistures your skin for like & a little tip, put your gel creams in the fridge after a long day in the sun/heat, it wheel amazing!!",1.0
Cute packaging and the stick is easy to apply and use. The formula is very creamy and goes on my skin easily. Haven’t used the product for very long yet so we’ll have to see after some time if there are Lon lasting effects.,1.0
"I love this moisturizer in the winter and when my skin is extra dry or at night. When I use it during the day it feels a bit too greasy to me and I don’t like the way it sits under foundation. During the summer I found it way too heavy for me, even with dry skin. Still recommend the product but for more specific use cases and not as an everyday moisturizer.",1.0
The Lancome night regenerating serum is a very light serum. It goes on smooth and your skin drinks it up. It doesn’t have a sticky feel to it and it doesn’t cause your skin to break out. I have noticed while using it the fine lines around my mouth and eyes are diminishing. It has incredibly helped with the puffiness under my eyes and it has tamed down my forhead wrinkles,1.0
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Olehenriksen for my honest opinion/review, and I can’t recommend this product enough beauties!! One of the nicest chemical exfoliants I’ve ever used and I can’t recommend enough, definitely get some beauties!",1.0
I bought this product in a box that had other tatcha products. This one in particular was my favorite. I began to use it a month before my senior pictures to help my face clear up. My friends and family soon became to notice that my face was actually clearing up. It’s a little pricey but I honestly don’t use a lot and it does last a long time for me. After using your face won’t feel dry it’s more of a refreshing clean sensation. 10/10 would buy again for sure.,1.0
"Love it, even more so than the original formula because of the matte finish. Easy to blend, even if I’m on the go in a hurry and HAD to use my fingers.",1.0
Love this product I had a mini berry one at it lasted so long so I decided to get the full size grapefruit one and it’s very moisturizing and smells amazing!,1.0
"I received a sample of this product, i used it for a couple of times then i immediately bought it. Its so light, doesnt clog or anything and gives amazing results! My face looks alot more clear and glowy",1.0
"This is not a setting spray, it really is a toner and face perfector in one! I use this on non make up days also, it helps keep everything from melting and definitely keeps me acne in check",1.0
I love this brand! The feel and the scent are the best by far!,1.0
I love this toner. It smells wonderful and is very hydrating. I’ll definitely be purchasing it in the future.,1.0
"I am obsessed with the results of this product, my skin feels like it can breathe & my skin also feels that it is behind hydrated after using this product ! I have had enough time to use the product to get to know it better on how my skin would react to it because I tend to have sensitive skin & my skin was not irritated at all! This product was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.",1.0
"I received this product for testing and review purposes, but I am genuinely impressed by the quality of the product. It’s undeniably high quality and is truly such a luxurious product to use. Even though it’s thick, it still works wonderfully for oily and acne prone skin types like myself. I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who needs a fragrance-free, reliable moisturizer for the colder, dryer winter months.",1.0
"I think I found my new all favorite moisturizer!  From the first time I tried this moisturizer, I love how it made my skin feel.  The gel/cream feel of the product feels amazing on the skin.  I use it every morning and night and love how baby smooth my skin feels from it.  It didn’t cause me to break out at all.  I can definitely feel the difference in my skin.  So happy Ireceived this product for free for testing purposes.  Will repurchase this product when I run out!",1.0
"I love this product, it smells great and feels great on my skin. I mix with the kora turmeric moisturizer in the morning, and I mix with the skin fix moisturizer at night. I feel like it has stepped up my glow. 4 stars for the high price point, as I’m going through it pretty fast.",1.0
My skin cannot go without the Superfood Cleanser. My skin feels so clean and refreshed every time I use it. It clears all of the impurities on my face without leaving me dried out. Worth every penny!,1.0
"I’ve never really known what the benefits of a serum were as opposed to just a facial cream. I used it for about a week and a half just once a day before bed, then took a trip and didn’t take it with me. My skin definitely noticed, and was much drier especially beside my nose and eyebrows. I was happy to get my serum back once I returned home! Would definitely recommend, even just for once a day use. Only thing I didn’t love was the cap because it poured out a little too much.",1.0
I love this moisturizer! I had never tried it and was so surprised how easily applied and how smooth it made my skin feel. The smell is very soft. This is perfect for my everyday routine. I’m so glad I was sent this complimentary for testing purposes because I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out.,1.0
"Love this product! It reduced my acne flair ups and boils, and makes my skin with fresh before applying moisturizer. It worked miracles for me. Great for people who workout a lot. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not make my skin react.",1.0
Takes all my makeup off without living an overly greasy film.,1.0
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder  in exchange for my honest review. The sample product was small, so I don’t feel I can speak on the effectiveness of what this product claims to do over an extended period of time of usage. The consistency is really nice. However, I am not a fan of the scent.",0.0
"Truly love this face wash. I already purchased several times. It needs very little product for a good face wash, so it lasts for a few months even when using it twice a day. It does not dry the skin, but cleanse face very well. I purchased two last time, one for myself and one for mom. And even though mom wasn’t too keen to try it out, she is in love with it as well. However, have to agree with few other people, packaging could be stronger. The lid breaks off easily.",1.0
I was so excited to try it because of all great reviews but I did not find any difference after using for long time. I don’t think I would purchase it again inshallah.,0.0
"Love love love this cream! I was super skeptical and took forever to buy it bc of the price point. However, I immediately saw a change in my skin and have already bought a refill. It is so hydrating and leaves my skin plump and moisturized.",1.0
LOVE this product.  It literally saved my face when it was acting out. I got a weird rash on one side during the winter that literally nothing was working. I received a sample for my birthday 2 years ago. This thing literally made majority of the rash go away overnight. Apart from that situation it leaves my skin moisturized and gives me a nice glow. Isn’t greasy. Now i’m on my second bottle. It’s become a staple.,1.0
"This product really intrigued me so I had to try it out. The dots stick on and don’t come off which is awesome and they do not smell like chemicals. I put one on overnight, with a whitehead pimple, and it definitely shrunk in size. It didn’t completely go away but this product really helped if you’re looking for a quick way to reduce inflammation. I will be continuing to use these!! I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review.",1.0
"I received a sample size of this product complementary for testing  purposes and I can HONESTLY say that I was very pleased! I have always been a fan of Laneige’s skin care line, and don’t know 100% what to expect when trying a lip mask. After wearing this consistently for 3-4 night I actually noticed the LINES in my lines become fainter! My lips were well hydrated and not dry, which is a huge problem for me in the winter time and during transition seasons. I found that this lip mask actually went into my skin, instead of just sitting on top of it. I also use it during the day as a lip gloss, and absolutely love it!! It adds a nice shine to my lips while keeping them hydrated! And the taste is really great.",1.0
"An impressive resurfacing serum and might just top my list of favorite products from Farmacy! If you’re an enthusiast of Lactic acid exfoliators, definitely give it a try!",1.0
"I use it 2-3 times a week and I can say it makes such a difference in my face. I wake up to a soft, smooth looking face as if I’m wearing a primer.",1.0
"This product was nice to use, following the eye cream they have. I haven’t noticed whether or not it actually brightened my skin so to speak, but it is moisturizing and gives me an awake feeling. I love citrus face care products as they are a good pick me up for my skincare. Nice scent and the product is light so there’s no heavy feeling or residue after using.",1.0
"When I first saw this product, I was skeptical.  I thought, there was no WAY it was worth the price tag.  Then I got it in the Sephora All Stars special edition Play! box.  The sample bottle looked so tiny.  Surely I’d get only a few uses out of it...right?I was so wrong, on both counts.  It really doesn’t take much.  I’ve been using my little tiny 10 ml sample bottle for over three weeks now, every morning and every evening.  After washing my face, before moisturizing, I pour a very small amount into my hand, just the tiniest splash (a puddle slightly larger than a dime), rub my hands together, and pat it all over my face and neck.  I have combination skin with hormonal breakouts once a month.  My skincare routine for decades (until now) has been rotating, changing by the week, depending on what my skin is needing at the moment.  This has been an effective way to manage my skin, but it’s tiresome having to constantly assess my skin’s needs.  Plus I have to purchase quite a few different products for both oily and dry skin, making my skincare routine much more expensive than I’d like it to be.From the very first day I used this essence, my skin improved.  Smoother texture was the first thing I noticed.  As I continued to use it, my fine lines became significantly less pronounced and my breakouts stopped entirely.  Not even exaggerating.  This week is the week that I normally break out like crazy.  And yet, all week, I haven’t had a single issue.  My skin has been perfect for three weeks.  Perfect.  This never happens to me. I’m sold.  I’m going to be buying more this week, once this little bottle is empty.  This essence is as amazing as they say.  It’s not just hype.  It really does balance the skin.  It’s amazing.  And yes, you should try it, especially if you have combination skin.  This might just be your holy grail, because it’s definitely mine!  Ask for a sample the next time you’re in Sephora.",1.0
Not bad but it tastes like a cheap berry medicine.,1.0
I have been using this moisturizer for 10 years now. It’s really wonderful if you have oily and sensitive skin.,1.0
"Kiehls is an amazing brand all together. What I found super pleasant about the “Ultra Facial” cream, was how hydrating it made the skin feel instantly. It glides on super smooth and feels refreshing as soon as it touches the skin. It can be a little heavy for under makeup use, if you have an oily T-zone as I do. My only solid complaint would be that it is in a jar, where as the face wash is in a bottle... I keep my hands very clean anytime I apply product to my face so it’s not a super worry I just don’t like the thought of any grime getting into the product. So far so good though. Overall I would definitely reccomend to a friend, and will be buying this product again for a long time to come. :)",1.0
I bought this moisturizer for my 20 year old daughter and she said it’s the best moisturizer she’s tried yet. She has extremely oily skin on her T Zone and dry skin on her cheeks and this moisturizer has made her skin feel amazing. The gel consistency is great for the oiliness and moisturizes the dry spots. She’s tried many skin care products  and this one is definitely her favourite. This moisturizer also makes her skin look nice and glowing. Please Farmacy make more products dedicated to oily skin.,1.0
"I feel like I’m pretty picky with under eye care. And honestly have found very few I actually enjoy. This is my new FAVORITE. My under eye dark circles are practically gone in the morning, and so is my puffiness. I will definitely be grabbing some more of this, despite the price tag!",1.0
Works great and it’s fun to use. The mini size lasts about 1-3 depending on how much and often you use it.,1.0
"This has been my new go-to daily cream for a while now, and I’m on at least my 4th jar.  Previously I used Caudalie’s Vinosource Intense Moisture Rescue Cream for years.  Really, I love them both.  I have insanely sensitive skin that easily reacts to products with break outs, redness and/or excessive dryness (flaky, itchy).  Using clean products is important to me and I’ve been doing so for over 10 years.  I’ve experimented a lot and these are two of my go-to brands (also love specific things from FAB).  Both this and Caudalie keep my skin calm, moisturized, happy and acne free.  I apply to face, neck, decolletage and back which are all very sensitive areas for me.  Both are also nearly the same price per ounce.  This is now my go-to because it is a larger size so I can order less frequently.",1.0
"This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that leaves my skin looking refreshed and hydrated. The texture of the cream is supple and rich but doesn’t apply heavily. I think it’s a great addition to a your summer care skincare routine. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.",1.0
"This is an amazing product! The balm smells lovely, doesn’t leave face greasy. Comes with a spatula. Took off all of my makeup, including mascara. Didn’t hurt/sting my eyes. After rinsing, I used a white washcloth, there was no makeup on the cloth. Had no mascara eye boogers. Had no irritations, skin was soft after. The only thing is dry spots are more visible after, so I moisturized after.",1.0
"I found that this product doesn’t work well on dry skin and will emphasize dry spots. I was really happy to use this, but I found that with the heavy moisturizers I use, it will pill and stick to the heavy cream. If you use, allow time for moisturizer to fully absorb, and use a thinner one. Overall it does the job of correcting my red spots but requires a lot of maintenance during the day.",0.0
Highly moisturizing. A little goes a long way. It absorbs well into the skin.,1.0
"amazing rice water wash! Leaves my skin so smooth and plump, smells delicious as well and the packaging is so cute.",1.0
"I wanted to love this product so much, but unfortunately it broke me out. I’ve heard amazing things from so many people that swear by this and it felt amazing when applying and smelled incredible. However, it just didn’t work for my skin. I would suggest trying a sample before purchasing the full product. My Mom and multiple friends have noticed a huge difference in their skin while using this essence.",1.0
"With the original CC and the illuminating CC, my face would be a big greaseball within an hour or two. But using the new CC matte, my oil stays away for a good 6 hours. And around that time, I only have to blot my NOSE and T zone area! I used to have to blot my entire face. That’s a win in my book! It is very thick as others have said, but I think that’s due to the formula including 3 different clays. Clay is thick people! Just put a little extra time giving it a good blend and it’s perfect. I don’t find it to be full coverage, but I don’t have skin issues so light to medium coverage is just fine for my face.",1.0
"After seeing and reading all the hype surrounding this product I decided to take the plunge and purchase it. For how high the price is I was not impressed. I felt like my $29 origins lotion gave me better results than this. It is very lightweight which I did enjoy because I hate the greasy feeling some moisturizes can leave. I decided to keep the product and give it a shot until I ran out. I’m now experiencing a terrible breakout and I’m starting to think it could be from this product. I have very sensitive/ acne prone / combo skin and this was unfortunately not a winner for me. I feel like it could benefit someone during the summer months, just maybe not winter.",1.0
"Gel type moisturizers aren’t typically my go-to. But this one impressed me!! For a gel cream texture it’s extremely hydrating/moisturizing. Love how quickly it sinks in and leaves no greasy/sticky residue behind. Leaves my skin plump, glowy, and soft. This will absolutely be a repurchase! Bonus points for the refillable pods!!",1.0
Good moisture when used but the smell is terrible. It smells like dirty feet :( Wish they would improve the smell of this cream because I otherwise love Biossance products.,0.0
I got this 1 week sample from influenster to try and give an honest review. I only got to use it for a week but to be a 100% honest I didn’t see much difference in my skin. Maybe it just needs more time to have the full effect. I didnt break out from the formula & it did give me some moisture but nothing drastic or life-changing....especially for the price.,0.0
I really enjoy this serum. It has a silky texture that doesn’t dry down sticky.  It has not irritated my skin at all and is nice to use both in the morning and at night.  I honestly cannot tell a difference with the texture of my face yet since I have only used to product for 2 weeks and the studies were done in 8 weeks.,1.0
"I love the idea of having a stick applicator because it is easy to use portable and I can adjust the amount that I want to use each time. I love the fact that does sunscreen is ocean friendly and Hawaii compliant. their new Wetforce and Heatforce technology is very interesting. I’ve used this under makeup during the entire time I was traveling in Italy during the winter. The texture of the sunscreen is moisturizing, but I did feel that it could be a bit sticky if you apply to much. I have extremely oily skin and I tend to steer clear of anything that makes my skin sticky. any ways, I works totally recommend this!",1.0
"This needs to be said. There are about 10-12 ingredients in skincare and makeup that cause cystic acne, and this product has roughly 7 of those ingredients. Please look it up. I didn’t prior to my purchase. Don’t buy this Moisturizer if you’re concerned with the possibility of breaking out. Period.",0.0
I absolutely believe in this product! I’ve tried so many things for my acne,1.0
Absolutely love it. Works very well it’s amazing for the price. Got rid of my acne which i never was able to get rid of. Saw results within a week. Definitely will buy more!!!,1.0
"I usually use youth to the people night masks, but since I got this product as a sample I decided to use it. I am not one to complain of a little stinging, so when I note the stinging that honeymoon glow gave me, please know it wasn’t subtle. I left it on for an hour until I finally gave in and washed it off and my face still stings. definitely sticking to youth to the people from now on!",0.0
"I typically think of an “acne treatment” as more of a cream. This is more of a pimple-fighting-mattifier. It is the consistency of water, a light pink-brown, contains some sort of powder, possibly sulfur, because - as another reviewer said, that is definitely the smell. Think of Clearisil in the 80s-90s. If you have medium to light skin, this might be a nice treatment to put in your t-zone or on a blemish before or after make-up. It would mattify your skin, even out redness, and be easy to blend into your skin. If you have darker skin, you wouldn’t be able to use it that way, so I only gave the product 3 stars. Another reason I gave it 3 stars is that, for me, it doesn’t work very quickly. It required being on overnight and I still have a bit of a pimple, but it did reduce it. I think this product would best serve older women who only have a little acne. In my opinion, people with more oily skin or lots of acne would need a stronger product. I ordered the standard size, so I’ll be trying it more before the product is finished. Maybe I’ll figure out how to use it more effectively and will be able to include more information.",0.0
This glowy lip balm gives off the effect of lip gloss without feeling goopy are sticky and moisturizes like a chapstick without feeling greasy! It left my lips soft and lasted for hours and the one I have smells like Pomegranate so that is pretty awesome. My only comment is it says that it is tinted but I don’t notice a color change on my lips when using it. Other than that this product does exactly as it says it does and I will be adding it into my daily rotation of products! ( I received this product for free for testing purposes),1.0
"Not sure exactly what this is supposed to do, could just be water. But I’ll continue to use this bottle because why not. Probably will not buy again unless something actually noticeable happens.",0.0
"This may not be for medium and darker skin tones. This has pearlescent component which contributes to the “brightening” effect. Albeit temporary, it was just what i was looking for, along with the “energizing” claim. However this shimmer, imo, borders on a highlighter. Esp on my medium skin tone. Also does not blend well upon application and it has a HINT of orange tint, which is noticeable. So, since my skin didn’t absorb it properly, it just made me look like I rubbed a dull highlighter around the eye area. Not for me.",0.0
"I got a sample of this peeling gel from Sephora play Pkg. Did not pay attention to it at first until 2-3 weeks later. I tried on my face to see how it works. When l saw some brown stuff molding on my face, l got scared, so wiped it off. I rubbed it on my face again and was amazed seeing rolls of dirt falling off my face. I fell in love with it instantly. No irritation whatsoever. Since then, l have bought 2 tubes of 3.4 oz size. It actually does what it says. Give it a shot and see what happens. Lovely. U can’t go wrong.",1.0
"I have never used Ole Henriksen before this product and as an introduction to the brand this is a great one. I’m hooked and in love! I was sent this by Influenster for free and couldn’t be happier! It actually does exactly as it claims, smoothing the skin instantly and cleaning out pores. There is grit to it as a physical exfoliator, however I can definitely tell a difference between this and say the Ives Apricot scrub, it doesn’t feel as harsh on the skin and I don’t feel like I’m using sand paper. It’s gritty because of the fine sugar and lemon peel extract, but the texture is like a jelly or slush which feels so nice on the skin. You definitely can feel the AHA’s working on your skin and at the same time it also soothes and refreshes the skin. I love massaging it into my skin and feel it going to work on smoothing and polishing. The first thing I noticed about this scrub is the smell and I mean that in the best way possible. With one whiff I feel like I’m outside on a warm summer day with a glass of fresh squeezed lemonade or at a wedding enjoy a delicious slice of lemon cake. The best part is that it really does smell natural. After two weeks of using this product (five uses) I’ve seen a dramatic change in my skin that I was not expecting. My skin is smoother than ever before, I do feel like it’s prevented breakouts and also shortened the length of the ones I have. The tone of my skin has evened out a lot, making dark spots and acne scars visibly reduced. I also noticed that my skin looks plumper and brighter, like it’s full of life and youth. I have tried a lot of scrubs, washes and cleansers over the years, from drugstore to high end but I have never tried a product that is as effective as this one.",1.0
"I received this product a few days ago and I’m already seeing results and they are amazing! This is my new favorite moisturizer! It makes my skin so soft, my blemishes are slowly starting to disappear. I can’t wait to see what my skin will look like in two weeks. I was sent this product by #Influenster in my #Voxbox to test and review for free.",1.0
"I got a sample jar of this in the Sephora Smarts K-Skincare box. I’ve tried several of Belif’s products before and am really becoming quite the fan of this brand! This is a super hydrating eye cream similar in texture to the Moisturizing Bomb face cream, but a little richer. I recently sampled Belif’s other eye cream- the Peat Miracle Revital eye cream. This is $10 cheaper, and just as effective in respect to the level of moisturizing, in my opinion. I do prefer the more balm-like texture of the Peat eye cream, and I also find it is a better base if I’m using a concealer. This is a wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a new eye cream, although I would also recommend trying the Peat eye cream if you can get a sample.",1.0
"I’m obsessed with this product. I just love the way it feels on my skin and is totally invisible.  It’s now my daily go to, to protect my face from the sun!",1.0
I cannot express in words how much I love this moisturizer! It just melts into your skin and hydrates it. It’s a nice lightweight moisturizer and feels like a serum and moisturizer in one. It has a nice clean scent as well. I love that it’s clean at sephora since I’ve been more conscious about what I put on my skin.,1.0
"I love these healing dots! After wearing them a couple nights, your acne flattens out and allows makeup to go on smoother in the morning.",1.0
"Overall there is nothing to dislike, it’s lightweight. My face is constantly oily but this product did not cause more or less oil. I did notice a bit of firmer skin. My fine lines have not gone away but maybe I need to be more consistent with the serum. Age: 23",1.0
I wish I could write something great about this product but unfortunately I can’t . So I brought this from Sephora favorites bedtime products . Irritated my whole face I turned red itchy  . I completely removed it with just water and try ice to calm down and nothing .,0.0
"I enjoyed this product. Personally I enjoy scrubs, this one is very grainy but does not feel too harsh. My skin is very sensitive so if I leave it on too long I get quite red so I’ll only wash for about 30 seconds. I can’t leave it on for longer otherwise I will get a reaction. I will continue to use as a scrub once a week for sure!",1.0
This has been a wonderful addition to my getting ready routine! I have combo skin and this works well for me. It hydrates nicely and doesn’t make my oily spots worse. It creates a nice base for under my makeup. It works great under both my liquid/cream foundation and powder.,1.0
I received a free sample of Alpha Beta Pore Perfecting by Dr Dennis Gross. It works pretty good I noticed a slight difference in my pores about 4 days after using it. Just not a product I will buy but did do its job.,1.0
"Love this! While this is a bit pricey (disclaimer I got this for free) I have to say the product is WORTH it. I loved everything about it so much. After the peel my skin felt so soft and glow! Highly recommend, It’s a perfect summer peel.",1.0
Amazing cleanser! I have oily skin and this left my skin feeling perfect! Really good at bringing all my makeup off and it doesn’t burn or irritate your eyes or skin! I really liked this product!!,1.0
This has really helped improve my hormonal acne. I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts poorly to masks and have been struggling but this is a product that helped me see a huge improvement in my skin.,1.0
It leaks thru pump. I use it maybe two or three times a week mostly in the mornings just tiny bit of it. And now bottle is almost half full cuz of leaking. Its just so annoying keep leaking. They need to improve packaging. As for as performance it didn’t do miracle on my skin.,0.0
"I’ve been using this night mask for 6ish months now. When I’m feeling lazy at night, this is the one product I put on. You can truly see results the next morning. I still struggle with acne as a 24 YO and alternating this night mask with retinol every other night will clear up a breakout for me in 3-4 days. As in, no evidence of breakout at all. It really feels like I wake up with a new face the morning after I use this mask.",1.0
"I am on my second tub of this and really like using it. My only concern is that it is likely causing some milia to develop, but it might be because i had been using too much initially. After reading some reviews i learned to cut back so we will see if any more milia occur. Overall i really love this product, it isn’t too heavy or sticky and my makeup sits well over it. It also does not pill up under other products which is a huge issue for me with other eye creams.",1.0
"This is my 3rd bottle and I love it. I’ve used high end HA’s that cost $60-$80 and this one does the job very well, especially for that price. I use this in the morning and evening, it’s the first thing I use on my face after I’ve cleansed. All you need is a drop.",1.0
I have thoroughly enjoyed this product.  I use in the evenings. My face always breaks out with new products but not with this.  I love the feel of this moisturizer and recommend it highly!,1.0
I’ ve been using this serum consistently for over 3 weeks now and wow! My face has been loving it. It has the perfect balance of every ingredient and leaves your skin so soft and moisturized. This is now added to my HOLY GRAIL list. My face is combo skin so it can easily get clogged with heavy creams and also dry out from powerful chemicals etc - this does not do any of that - which is amazing.,1.0
"I have a really dry skin. It does it’s job, without messing with the skin.",1.0
"I put a generous amount of this on before bed and slept with it on. There was some residue left over in the morning but it was easy enough to wash off. My skin seemed more hydrated than usual and not irritated at all, I have sensitive skin.",1.0
"The BEST! My skin gets more oily in my T-zone in the summertime, so I’d be curious to try this in the winter. However, I am loving it now and noticing obvious results. Less oil production and my skin is looking more clear and glowy! I definitely recommend this. Also, the trial size is only $10, so I picked up in the store and thought it came with a decent amount of product for the price and quality :)",1.0
This person was really paying attention of what I needed and I loved his professional customer service.,1.0
"I have acne-prone skin which typically stays well-controlled. I received the mini size of this and decided to try it for some patchy winter dryness. While this has a lovely scent, nice texture, and is definitely moisturizing, it unfortunately triggered a breakout.",0.0
"I really like this mask, I think it’s much different than any other I’ve used before and doesn’t feel like it’s getting all over my pillows/bed while I’m sleeping. It just stays put and my skin feels super firm/moisturized the next day. The size is a bit small, but takes me a while to get through as I only use 1-2 times a week.",1.0
"Such a GREAT product!  I have been loyal to the Murad Vitamin C for many years but got a sample of this at my Sephora...I could not believe the difference I saw with just one use.  The savings from Murad to this Sephora Collection is amazing!  This product alone got me to try more of the Sephora skin care collection.  THANK YOU, Sephora for making such an affordable, effective and beautiful skin care line!!!",1.0
"So this product feels amazing on my skin, YES, but it doesn’t last. I have really dry skin and when I put this on, it feels incredible. Its like my skin is drinking water. However, the hydration doesn’t last. I like to let my moisturizer sink into my skin before makeup, but after like 10 minutes, my skin is dehydrated again. So i have to go in with a second moisturizer. I wouldn’t mind if this was drugstore price, BUT ITS NOT lol",0.0
"i love this!! it’s great for reapplication. goes on clear and dries clear so it’s great for all skin tones!! very easy to use on the go or just if you don’t want your hands all greasy. wouldn’t recommend for initial application tho, because it may miss some hard to reach spots. i received this complimentary from influenster",1.0
My skin loves this sunscreen. It has such a nice blurring effect and glowy finish without feeling heavy and leaving my pores clogged. Super gentle and non-irritating and I’ve been using this daily with just some concealer in place of my normal foundation/primer.,1.0
"I love the feel, but this has started pilling up under my foundation or powder, everytime i use it.  I tried the mini, and thought it would work well, but then the constant pilling started.  Very disappointed, and now looking at another spf to try.",0.0
"Very shimmery tint, stings the eyes,  not water resistant,  matte instead of glowy and it leaves a metallic finish.  Too expensive as well.",0.0
I’ve been using this product for about 1.5 years for a reason...it has been the only thing that keeps my oily skin at bay for any length of time!  It has been a godsend and great for my still-getting-acne-at-30 face.,1.0
My favorite cleanser! I always come back even though I like to switch it up from time to time. Nourishes my skin but I also feel clean afterward!,1.0
"I love this one and the gel moisturizer. The only issue is, the smell. My skin can’t handle fragrances, natural or not. I break out like crazy. It’s the best moisturizer I’ve ever used just not for sensitive skin. Your face is constantly not dry, You don’t need much at all and it last for a while. I just wish they had this in an unscented/ fragrance free one.",1.0
makes your skin feel clean without being overly stripped,1.0
highly recommend this product- it is easy on my aging sensitive skin.  absorbs into the skin and leaves it hydrated-non greasy and no breakouts or reactions.,1.0
"This is a must! I use this solution twice a week on my face, neck, and hands. I saw huge improvement in my hands and wish that I had started using it sooner. Plus it is much less expensive than the comparable.",1.0
I enjoy this face wash very much. Can really see a difference,1.0
"I like DE in general and am a huge fan of cleansing balms so I ordered this right away and assumed I would love it. The packaging is great (the magnetic scoop stays with the tub rather than floating around my bathroom loose like those tools usually do), the price per ounce isn’t outrageous, and the ingredients are fabulous. This doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes, removes most makeup and leaves my skin soft like a baby’s butt.  Unfortunately, after the first few uses, the entire tub separates into a gloopy mess, making it almost impossible to scoop out in any sort of controlled or even manner - some bits are waxy chunks, others are pools of oil. It simply refuses to stay uniform or mixed. I’ve gone through two tubs and both did the same thing. Sadly, I won’t repurchase since it just becomes too difficult and messy to use after the first few days.",0.0
I really like this serum. Feels great on the skin and doesn’t break me out. It’s also is a great primer under makeup. It’s a makeup gripper. The makeup grips to the serum and stays put all day.,1.0
"I really liked this product. It smelled good, but was not overpowering. It moisturized my skin well, but I noticed that my face became dry feeling later in the day.",1.0
Love Supergoop..!! it has a glow that match perfect with my skin...non greasy at all..!,1.0
"Okay hear me out. A moisturizer, instead of a mask. Literally THE BEST MOISTURIZER YOU’ll EVER USE. I swear to you, this is amazing. Didn’t break me out at all, and it didn’t bother my sensitive skin AT ALL. I keep this on deck at all times. I use it morning and night as a moisturizer and I swear I wake up looking 5 years younger. Keeps me moisturized throughout the ENTIRE DAY! You need this, I promise.",1.0
I love la mer so this was definitely a treat. it feels so luxurious and the jars are so cute. This is definitely a special occasion product for me but one I look forward to using everytime. It also looks great under make up.,1.0
"This is the first time I have ever tried a precleanse, and I have to say, I’m really loving it! I used it as directed in the instructions and it just melts away makeup, sweat, and daily grime. When I used my cleanser after my face felt fresher but not dried out or anything. It also has a really nice smell, like maybe lemongrass or something. I received this as a complementary sample for testing purposes, but I would totally purchase this on the future!",1.0
"By far one of the best cleansers I’ve ever used. I finally broke down and bought it. Although this is the most I’ve ever paid for cleanser, it’s well worth it. I initially tried this as a free sample size from the Insider Rewards Bazar. I was so crushed when I used up the sample.",1.0
This works so well to remove a full face of makeup in literally seconds. My skin feels wonderful after using it!,1.0
It smells so clean sometimes I just open it to smell it. The texture everything is amazing get it,1.0
"Possibly the best lip mask out there. Really keeps your lips from drying all night long, and stays on till morning. The only downfall may be that it’s not as moisturizing as it could be. But yet again a little goes a long way and it really provides.",1.0
"I received this compliments of Influenster for my honest review and sadly I was not overly impressed. It was a nice thick moisturizer but as far as helping improve texture, Tone and fine lines...I saw no difference of course I only had a mini size so maybe over a very long period of time rather than 3 weeks that I’ve tried it, there may have been a difference but I wouldn’t have high hopes. It also had a strong floral smell that I did not find appealing.",0.0
"So fantastic and satisfying - rub it on while your skin is dry and watch as the dry skin crumbles off. Does not leave you feel stripped or irritated, which is a big plus. Try it, I doubt anyone would regret it. I would only say that it’s a little pricey, but a bit goes a long way. I have had the small one for a few months now and I still have lots of product. Recommend!!!!",1.0
"I was so excited to receive this in my Trendmood Box and. I must say it lives up to the hype! You will notice an immediate plumping effect and fine lines just fade away! This serum has a nice, lighter consistency that I love since I have oily skin. I will definitely be implementing this serum into my regular skincare routine!",1.0
amazing. wish there was more in a pack but oh well there great!,1.0
This works so well! Noticable improvement within the first week.  I felt a slight stinging during my first few uses but it’s went away eith usage.,1.0
I couldn’t live without this product. it’s so gentle and it makes a huge difference in my skin. it gently exfoliates and brightens,1.0
I have not tried Tatcha before so I was really excited to give this a test! I have heard great things about Tatcha but the price tag always intimidated me. I like the sleek packaging of this serum stick. It makes traveling with it a breeze. Application was nice but would sometimes pull when gliding it over your skin. It’s better if you take some of the product using your fingers and then tapping it around desired area. I haven’t noticed a difference from the few uses but it’s a great alternative to a moisturizer. I don’t think the price tag reflects the product.,0.0
"Super fantastic cleanser that’s gentle and does a great job of keeping my skin clear, bouncy and refreshed! I’ve been using this for a few years and it’s apart of my permanent skincare routine. It’s very concentrated so one bottle lasts me a long time! Love love ty yttp!",1.0
Extremely hydrating yet lightweight! Leaves an amazing natural glow and works amazing under makeup!,1.0
I received a sample and it is by far the best lip mask I’ve tried. I bought cheaper full sized products but ended up wishing I’d spent the money on this instead!,1.0
"It is a light soap that does not dry out your face but you really feel like it leaves it clean and soft, it is ideal even if you do not have acne",1.0
"I have used this consistently and it is very gentle, unique, and great quality product. The formula is non stripping, non irritating as well as affective. It has a jelly like texture without it being sticky and doesn’t foam up a lot and feels amazing during and afterwards. My skin is soft, smooth, and clean.",1.0
"This product was light and did not have too strong of a scent. It made my skin feel smooth after putting it on. In a week I noticed a slight difference in the appearance of my skin overall, especially with dry/red areas that have been a struggle for me. The product does absorb very very quickly, so I had to use more than expected for full coverage.",1.0
My favourite cleanser at Sephora!! Light weight and removes my makeup easily in the shower!,1.0
"I have very large pores in my T-Zone and started using this product last week (only in the morning) and have already noticed a difference. A little goes a long way, which makes it great with the steep pricing. I have tried so many other treatments and nothing has come close to what this product has done in only 5 days. Would definitely recommend for anyone with oily and/or large pores.",1.0
#tryitfree#topboxThis product works very well to target wrinkles under eyes especially when combined with the wrinkle correcting cream.  A little goes a long way.  Made a difference after one use! Miracle product!,1.0
I’ve been loving this lip balm! The texture is so buttery and it’s really moisturizing and smoothing for the lips.  I’ve been loving that the color is very subtle and buildable!  It’s nice to have a lip balm that gives your lips a little life and color.  I took pictures before and after- my shade is a soft mauve-sugar peony.,1.0
My makeup comes off super easy with this and its waterproof.  The best part is that it doesn’t sting my eyes nor am I allergic to it like most facial cleaners.,1.0
"For an expensive moisturizer, I really expected it to do something for my skin but I think a $7 moisturizer from the drug store could do the same for my skin if not more. The moisturizer is really sticky and doesn’t absorb quickly, smells pretty cheap, and doesn’t hydrate my skin properly. Despite daily application, my skin still has slightly flakey, drier patches sometimes. Would not buy again.",0.0
"I received this product free from Influenster to try and review. I like it and it feels good on my skin, but I didn’t notice a huge difference in my complexion. You might need to use it more regularly before seeing a result, but I still had fun with it!",1.0
"I received this complimentary to try from Bzzagent!  I’ve been using this makeup remover for a week now; was a little scared it would break my acne prone sensitive skin out but it did NOT!  The scent is not pleasant but not offensive..it smells herbally like the Michael Todd charcoal cleansing gel... The pump packaging is just okay; you don’t really have much control over the pump even if you try to do a slow half pump, it squirts out everywhere so you have to be careful when pumping it out..The feel of it was slippery but didn’t feel like it saturated/penetrated my skin enough to remove makeup. I much prefer the texture of my Tony Moly peach cleansing balm..  It did remove my makeup though it didn’t glide like I would’ve liked it to.  It didn’t leave my combo skin feeling too tight but I’d imagine if you had drier skin than oily, it might dry you out.PROS: does what it says it will do, didn’t break me outCONS: packaging, price is high",1.0
"I’ve been using vaseline on my lips at night for over a decade. I saw the amazing reviews of this product and was excited to replace my vaseline with something a little more luxurious. I like the scent. The texture is great. But, I have woken up every morning with dry lips. I’ve switched back to vaseline. If you’ve never used anything on your lips at night, this may be great for you. But, if you’ve been using something that already worked- I think you’re going to be disappointed and out a whopping $20.",0.0
Not for me I have oily skin and this made around my mouth feel dry and I had a red appearance all day long. I think it may be the perfume in this because it has a very strong orange scent,0.0
Amazing! I love the gel texture as i feel it moisturizes well with my normal to oily skin. Has a soft pleasant scent. Moisturizes great and doesn’t break me out. Definitely recommend and i love that its clean!,1.0
I was really hoping to like this product. I never wrote a review but I was very disappointed. I LOVE the ordinary products but this one I guess was too strong. I was trying to clear up slight acne scars and anywhere I put the acid got bumps. I am now going into a third week of these bumps on my skin. I cleared my acne but now I have texture from this product and nothing is working.,0.0
Non sticky and light. No smells really and quite easy to apply but not as smooth on the skin as I thought it would be but good.,1.0
Love this! My skin feels so hydrated and felt never better!,1.0
"Such an amazing moisturizer! I have repurchased this multiple times because it gives my skin such a hydrated and plump effect! I use this before my makeup, and my makeup sits beautifully on top of it.",1.0
I received this as a trial product with an order and ended up purchasing it immediately. It beats creamier sunscreens that muck up your skincare and clog pores. This is super light and feels great.,1.0
Best makeup remover I’ve bought! Feels smooth and gentle on my skin while taking off ALL my waterproof mascara/eyeliner! BETTER than the caudalie makeup removing cleansing oil! IT’S A MUST BUY!,1.0
"Very very very impressed with this sunscreen! Extremely subtle spf smell and glides right on your face. ZERO white cast! It has the same consistency of the ELF primer I use. Not greasy at all and zero shine! The only downsize is the price. I will say you don’t have to use much to get a good layer on your face. If you want a really great sunscreen and have oily/acne prone skin like me, then this is PERFECT!",1.0
"This moisturizer is amazing. I love how lightweight it is on my skin but still manages to hydrate my dry skin. I have really dry skin, especially in the summer, and this has been my saving grace! It moisturizers me without my skin feeling heavy or oily and you only need the smallest amount of this moisturizer to get the full effect. This will probably last me such a long time since a little goes a long way! I definitely recommend this product for someone with sensitive, dry skin like myself. I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Lancome for testing purposes!",1.0
I received a free sample from the Influenster vox box. This worked well to lighten my dark circles. My eyes look better with lighter dark circles. It dries quickly and makes my eyes look brighter. It does give a youthful appearance. I look less tired after using this product. I liked this product.,1.0
I received thi product for free from influenster for a honest review.  I have extremely dry skin and I have to admit that it did a very good job hydrating my skin. The smell is just regular. I will definitely keep using it,1.0
This product has high quality and works very well. The smell and quality of the product are noticeable as well and feel top of the line. We have noticed a small improvement in just a short time of using it and as such with ur evaluation so far it is highly reccommended.,1.0
"I received this #freeproduct Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream from #trywithtopbox program.  Unfortunately it was just a small sample size pouch enough for 2 uses.    I used the product for 2 nights and I can honestly say that the product is light feeling, nice texture with no perfumey smell that similar high-end products have.  Looking forward to trying the regular size.",1.0
I got this as a sample so I could compare to my favorite farmacy green clean. I felt like the de left too much of a greasy film and did not remove all my makeup. it doesnt always melt as easily either. I personally like to double cleanse then wipe my face with a white micro fiber cloth and I noticed a ton of makeup left over with the slaai (even after double cleansing). I wanted to like this because the magnetic scoop looks much easier than the farmacy but I’ll stick to the green clean.,0.0
"This is the real deal. I was suffering from intense dry skin bc of medicine and couldn’t find ANYTHING. I tried oils, serums anything and everything. I got this as a sample and was so pleased with the results! It’s super moisturizing but doesn’t make skin look oily. I used this at night and next morning my skin was already better. I had cracked skin under eyes and this fixed it on two days.",1.0
Nice nothing special. Hydrating non fragranced. I was sent this product for testing purposes but I wouldn’t purchase myself,0.0
I loved this product! I have very dry and sensitive skin (especially in the winter) and only after one use my face was hydrated and I no longer had any dry patches. I highly recommend this!,1.0
Amazing. I tried so many products and this one actually worked. I struggled with hormonal acne for years. I only applied once a day instead of 2 times. It’s not irritating for my skin.,1.0
"I received a sample size to try from Influenster.  I liked the texture of the repair cream, it was silky when applied under the eye.  I noticed a bit of improvement in hydration under my eyes.  With the sample size, I wasn’t able to really see much improvement in under eye wrinkles in the short time I was able to use the repair cream.",1.0
My favourite toner!! I love how it helps with my combination skin and acne. Evens out the skin very nicely. I even used it on my chest and the acne went away. My holy grail!,1.0
This is a great face wash. It does a wonderful job and I enjoy it. It removes all my makeup with ease. Smells great too. I received this product via influenster as part of a campaign.,1.0
I love this toner top 1 of my favorites it help with my redness chicks and hydrates my skin so nicely I have combination skin and it works perfect for me totally recommended!,1.0
"Ok so I didn’t want to love it. I saw the price point and the claims Dior Skin Perfector was making and I thought too good too be true but it’s NOT! It works guys. It really works. My fine lines are less noticeable, my skin has a more even texture and my makeup lasts even through wearing a mask. I used it exclusively for 7 days to test it and now I can’t imagine going without it ever. It even went into my bag when I was evacuated due to fires.",1.0
"I suffer from deep hyperpigmentation, pit and ice pick scars and this product has helped TREMENDOUSLY! I started off by only using the product once a week and built up for using it every other day. Of course my scarring didn’t completely disappear but it has improved by minimizing pores, smoothing out texture and lighting discolouration. I have no complaints about this product and will recommend it to anyone with similar skin concerns. ALSO, when using the retinol, I paired it with either the Hydra-B serum from Drunk Elephant or Sephora Collections All Day Hydrator!",1.0
This is the first cleansing wipe that actually removes my eye makeup without having to also wash my face before and after using. LOVE.,1.0
"Did absolutely nothing to moisturize my skin. I have combination skin, and after applying I found that my skin felt very dried out and I had to go in with another moisturizer",0.0
"My friends had been recommending this for a while now and i finally caved and bought it. LET ME TELL YOU THIS STUFF IS A LIFE SAVER! I put it on before bed and wake up with supple hydrated lips, personality i like to also use a small amount as a lip balm during the day super glossy look and the flavour is sooo good!!!!",1.0
"I absolutely LOVE this oil, I cannot rant and rave about it enough.  The smell is very reminiscent of J’adore Dior which is one of my favourite perfumes.  The formula itself is not too thick or heavy, closer to a watery consistency like the names suggests and absorbs like a dream, leaves my skin feeling absolutely glorious",1.0
I’ve trued millions and millions of creams. Okay maybe I’m being dramatic but seriously I love this one! Not too thick and soaks in and I feel so hydrated. I use it morning and night.,1.0
"I really wanted to love this product as I was hoping to make Caudalie my new go-to line for its clean ingredients, cruelty-free stance",0.0
Great cleansing balm for double cleanse. I couldn’t believe the amount of makeup and gunk that it removed from my face. Truly the first pre cleanse product I’ve used that I feel like really gets absolutely everything off my face after having worn makeup all day/night. Love the little scoop they include to get the perfect amount each time. 10/10!,1.0
"This used to be a 5-star product for me but, like other reviewers, I absolutely hate the new formula. The old formula had a pleasant natural rose smell which was the main reason I actually used the product. It made my skin soft but I don’t think it made any difference in tone or brightning. When I repurchased a few months ago I was so disappointed. The new formula has an overwhelmingly fake rose perfume smell that is just obnoxious and it feels more oily on my skin. Sadly this will be my last jar of Wild Rose.",0.0
"I bought the Charcoal Exfoliating wipes and my god they are the best face wipes I have EVER used. The exfoliating side is actually scrubby and your face feels like you’ve just had a high quality face scrub after using it. I don’t know if the other side is necessarily meant to be used but its sooooo nice just to rub it over your face afterwards, or to do your eyes with, its just very soothing. I love these bad boys",1.0
"Bought the full size of this stuff about 4 months ago and have been using it (almost) everyday since then. This is a great, gentle exfoliant. I personally like that I can feel the exfoliating happening under my fingers without it being harsh at all. My skin’s surface is smoother than it ever was before, and this change is consistent. Even on days I’m too tired to add this extra step, my skin can survive and stay smooth for the next day. I do have mild acne and this product has helped minimize new blemishes appear. Overall, love this product and highly recommend it!",1.0
"I only used this once (received a sample via Influenster) but can see this really helping my skin if I used it consistently. It’s a presoaked pad that you can use anywhere you have sun damage. I didn’t have any reaction . It did leave my skin feeling a little tacky but since it’s supposed to be used at night , I didn’t mind too much.  I applied moisturizer 15 minutes after applying the pad. When I woke up my skin looked good and supple (felt bouncy to the touch) . My skin did still feel tacky but went away after rinsing .  My skin throughout the day did feel a little itchy .. not all day but more than normal.",1.0
This cream came at such a great time. I was looking for a vitamin c facial product to help even out my tone and this was such a treat. I felt noticeable skin color correcting in a short period of time. It is super moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and it did not bother my skin or cause me to break out. Highly recommend! I received this from influenster for free in exchange for my honest review.,1.0
"Love this control serum, it helps with all my skin mixed textures and dryness. I always use it after my shower and when I wake up in the morning, I pair it with Bioderma cream.",1.0
"I absolutely loved receiving this moisturizer. It smelled so clean and fresh and felt amazing on my face each morning! I used the double serum before the moisturizer and after about a week of consistent use I noticed a significant improvement in my skins tone and a subtle glow. I’ve already purchased a full size of the serum and will purchase the moisturizer as soon as I run out. Great Clarins product, highly recommend!",1.0
This product is amazing! I have been using it for two years (almost) every night and I wake up to nice soft lips! I will use it during the day as well especially is my lips are really chapped (New England winter problems). I bought my two best friends this and they swear by it now.,1.0

I got the small one of these in the little birthday package they give you and I will definitely be buying the full size one. I use it at night after lightly exfoliating my lips and I wake up and they are super soft. I also use it in the morning and my lips are nice and soft all day. Totally a great product!!!,1.0
Thought this was a little to thick. Probably wouldn’t get this again.,0.0
I have combo skin and this has been a miracle for my complexion! It gives my dry skin a nice glow and doesn’t wreck my tzone in the process. The smell is amazing and I loved the texture. Your face feels clean without feeling stripped. I received this complimentary product to test and I definitely plan on getting it again.,1.0
"I wanted to love this because of this awesome brand but it’s just not my favorite. Made some parts of my skin burn, especially my under eyes. I would switch to other moisturizers and wouldn’t have the same problem. It left some of my dryer areas still dry. My normal areas were well moisturized though. Love the idea of this company but this just didn’t work for me.",0.0
Me and my mom have been using this for about two weeks now and are loving it. My mom is 73 years old and has seen a difference in her wrinkles. We both have also felt our skin very moisturized since using this.,1.0
Excellent product it’s amazing I’ve tried another brands good but not as good as this one,1.0
"I got this as part of my January bday gift from Sephora and I will forever use this product the rest of my life! As someone with pretty dry lips I have not needed chapstick during the day in weeks and I recently noticed less lines in my lips which I can only attribute to this because I’ve done nothing else differently! This stuff feels amazing and makes your lips looks super glossy and plump, I would actually wear this out if it wasn’t pandemic season and I had somewhere to go! I highly recommend this! I’m not at all a girly girl with a skin care routine, I don’t think I’ve ever even used a lotion... but I will never go without this product now that I have found it!",1.0
I received this product complimentary from Influenster. This product smells great. My pores look smaller and it toned my skin. My skin absorbed everything super quickly. It made my face look amazing! I really enjoy it and will get more when I run out. It’s the best toner out there for all skin types.,1.0
Please make the 6oz into a tube form too. The jar container means product gets exposed to air more and goes bad/ineffective faster :(,1.0
This is a creation from God. Theirs no weird feeling when applied. This will make you look like you got a lip job. Simply the best out!!!,1.0
"I don’t care for this mask, doesn’t really feel like it does anything? Just feels super soft after but tone looks the same. Maybe I’m using it wrong lol",0.0
Wonderful moisturizer for my sensitive skin. Helps my redness and dryness especially during the colder months. Really a great overall moisturizer for both face and hands if you buy the on the go size!,1.0
"It’s not a bad product, but I wouldn’t buy it again. It has a very strong self-tanner smell and the color doesn’t last long.. maybe a day until I shower again. I am quite pale and I got the light. I would definitely recommend the medium even if you are pale like me.",0.0
"The cloying honey scent slaps you square in the nose and doesn’t give up. I had to wash my face to remove the moisturizer and use something with a less overpowering scent. Never had a problem with scented face lotions before but this one was so sweet, it just knocks you over.",0.0
"Urban Environment squeeze tube first impressionHas a medium weight texture with a glycerin moisturizing slip. Glides across the skin effortlessly and sinks in within 30 sec to 1 min and left my face feeling dewy and hydrated, appearing glowy but not greasy. Has what feels like a burst of cooling water effect on the skin. Skin feels plump and bouncy to the touch. Upon application there’s a strong scent of spf mixed with a light floral. 3 mins later can still smell it a little but it’s fading. 10 mins later can still smell it but my skin feels amazing so hydrated and plump. After using for a few weeks: I don’t notice the smell lingering as much anymore but it’s still there. It’s really nice it’s so hydrating but not greasy that I can wear it alone or with a lightweight moisturizer underneath (my skin is normal to dry). This gives my skin a dewy beautiful glow! It’s a natural sheen that isn’t glittery or shimmery and it’s sooo nice. If you have dehydrated skin that doesn’t react to fragrance give it a try! The denatured Alcohol didn’t make me breakout or feel dry. The formula is elegant and better than drugstore spfs I’ve tried. The fact that it’s spf 42 instead of 30 is great and I typically do 2 layers.",1.0
I got this #freeproduct from #topbox.   The sample size was a one time use so can’t say much about the product besides it went on nice.   I used it before bed.,1.0
"For starters I am obsessed with the packaging. The bottle is adorable and glass, I really love it. The texture was like a runny lotion, with a soft fruity scent. It absorbed into my skin very easily and altho I don’t have much redness it was soothing. It does remind me of other sort of milky serums from amore pacific brands, but to me this one is a bit creamier and I will absolutely keep this in my routine. I did receive this complimentary from the brand, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.",1.0
The Laniege sleeping mask is still the best. I see nothing different on my lips after using this.,0.0
I was excited to try this and super pumped by the amount of product you get but I felt like this did nothing for my skin. I received this free from Influenster.,0.0
"I really like this serum because it’s a stick not liquid and you can easily carry this product in your handbag. I used this serum as a moisturizer on my entire face and I am happy that my skin instantly looks glowy and hydrated. I am really into ingredients and happy to see Japanese lemon balm, that support collagen production, hyalauronic acid, and 80% purified Squalane in the ingredients for instant moisture and hydration. It’s true that it glides on smoothly and gives an instant glow. Also, I have seen a huge difference in how this product evens out my skin tone.  It’s the best anti aging serum and can also be used as a face moisturizer. Over all, this multi purpose TATCHA serum visibly reduces dryness, improves skin texture, and gives an instant glow and reduces appearance of fine lines.",1.0
"I have oily skin and this product dried out my skin after one use. My skin was flaky and low key peeling. While it does even out skin tone, it’s not easy to apply and doesn’t do well under makeup.",0.0
"I received a sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting cream in exchange for a review. I used the product at night as part of my skin care routine.I really enjoyed the texture, it applies smoothly onto my skin.I liked the absence of fragrance and the application of the cream is pleasant. It seems to be a good moisturizer, but I wish I had tested it longer. I consider purchasing the product to see the long term effects .#freeproduct #trywithtopbox",1.0
"It’s a nice dewy mist with good ingredients for the face! It’s not that long lasting and transfer proof, but that’s to be expected with dewy mists. The worst part though is that I wear glasses, this mist makes my eyelashes more oily, and my oilier lashes will blur my lenses -_-",1.0
"I LOVE THIS MASK! It is so cooling, refreshing, and toning. It’s very calming on the skin. I tend to double mask this with the Umbrian Clay mask. I use the clay mask to purify and then I go in with this mask to hydrate and tone! Definitely worth the money. Keeps my skin glowing and healthy!",1.0
My holy grail.  This has done wonders for my skin.  I have tried cheaper lactic acid treatments but they just did not do what this does.  I highly recommend if you have stubborn acne or texture.,1.0
"Been using this, for now, two weeks and I am obsessed. The Sephora employee told me to use this every other day and I’ve been doing this and it works amazingly",1.0
Pretty good! Smells nice and looks citrusy lol. It is not tacky and goes on smooth. I was a bit worried about wearing this during the day but I wore a powder sunscreen over it and didn’t get burned. Overall it’s good. I’ve used it a couple of times and like it. Very moisturizing. I’m not a fan of products in pots without applicators so that gets one less star from me. I like the formula and would consider purchasing in the future.,1.0
I thought this was a great and brightening eye cream.  I’ve been loving how it brightens my undereye.  Love this and also it’s also very gentle and doesn’t sting my eyes.  I would also say it’s pretty hydrating as well!  Gifted by Sunday Riley,1.0
"The BEST! I used Boscia then switched over to Fresh since it wasn’t doing the job. Loved Fresh but continued having small bumps on forehead and chin. Also suffering from terrible adult acne that would not stop flaring up. Started getting worse so I frantically ran to Sephora. An employee suggested I stop Fresh and use this since my skin is on the sensitive side (yay thanks hormones). I was super hesitant but needed something different and boy was I glad I made the switch. This effectively cleans and makes my face feel super clean and smooth after. Ever since I made the switch, I haven’t had one zit! I suffered from acne all through teenage years and for the past two years. If this works for my picky skin, it will work with yours.",1.0
it removes makeup just as well as the normal version so it’s a very good balm.  But this has a super intense maraschino cherry scent.  if you don’t like fragrance pass on this one...,1.0
"I think the dimethicone in it is creating the dewy effect and also leaves the skin very greasy/sticky. Not a fan of that at all. Im glad I had a sample to try it first, I will not buy.",0.0
"This is my holy grail- it’s perfect to use in the summer or if you plan on working out. I normally use it in the AM after a quick rinse and I’m going to work out, or in the evening after a bioderma face wipe, because it doesn’t clog pores and doesn’t have emollients in it that will do that when you’re sweating. It’s obviously not good for a night cream, etc. because it’s very light (but simultaneously very moisturizing!)",1.0
This product was gifted to me from Influenser and I am so glad I got to try it ! It is such a great product. It definitely gives me a beautiful glow ! A little amount also goes a long way !,1.0
Added to my nightly routine and I couldn’t be happier,1.0
"This is a very good serum. It’s worth for the price. The only thing is that I don’t know if its a morning serum or a night serum because it doesn’t say. It’s super, works great on your skin! Also it adds a very nice natural shine and keeps your face hydrated! Already my 4th bottle! I REALLY RECOMMEND IT, PLEASE BUY IT :)",1.0
"amazing product!!!! i love it, it really has been controlling my oils and does well to my normal/slightly dry parts on my face. 100% recommend to any skin type, my only issue is the packing!!!!! it sucks, i wish it were in a tube or pump",1.0
"I thought I was set on nightcreams and masks, but I’m SO GLAD I tried out the Hydro Biotic Recovery Sleeping Mask! I love it- I wake up with skin that glows all day long!!!! Feels great on my skin, and a little goes a long way. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.",1.0
"I received this free product in exchange for an honest review. I got 7 days worth of samples and used them regularly. It does not have a very strong smell which is a plus for me. It brightens my skin and keeps it soft long after application. I have combination skin that is slightly sensitive to harsh products. Clarins double serum did not have any adverse reaction on my skin. While everything sounds great, I think the price point of the product is way too high for the quantity.",1.0
"This formula is easy to apply, but the end result doesn’t leave a silky smooth finish like I expected. The results were good, but for the price point I would have expected more. Overall, it is a good product.",0.0
"Absolutely love this serum! Right after using it, my fave always feels hydrated but never slimey or sticky like some serums feel. The scent it light and botanical but not overwhelming. Since using this, my skin just looks healthy- even toned and glowing and I’ve been complimented on how young it looks. A friend even asked me if I had work done on my forehead because my fine lines were less noticeable! This is definitely a buy again product.",1.0
"i can seriously notice a difference in my skin now! i have olive toned skin and have battled hormonal cystic acne for almost 10 years. I had only recently stopped breaking out (yay) but my skin has been THROUGH IT ALL. my skin would often be red due to how sensitive it has become after acne treatments (particularly after accutane). at first, i thought that this serum didn’t work for me at, but now after 2 weeks of continuous use, i see my redness go down significantly. my skin looks so much brighter and my complexion is significantly more radiant!!! i use it right after toning and before moisturizer and i find that my skincare is incomplete without this now!",1.0
"Best. Eye cream. Ever. I have tried every eye cream under the sun—from la met, to drunk elephant, to fresh—you name it, Ive tried it. This is the first eye cream that I’ve fallen in love with, instantly. Overnight, my eyes looked brighter. It depuffs really fast too. This will forever be a staple for me. Really surprised and impressed by something this cheap. Love it!!",1.0
Love the packaging BUT this dried out my skin like crazy! I’m super oily but now have a bunch of dryness around my rose and chin since using this.,0.0
LOVE this cleanser! I use it every night before bed as part of my skin care routine. It leaves my face feeling so clean and refreshed. I feel good purchasing YTTP products because they are committed to no animal testing. I love their products. I like that it comes in a glass bottle. My cleanser initially came as part of a set. I definitely recommend trying their sets. It’s a great way to try out the products. Now this cleanser has become my go to cleanser every day.,1.0
After you try this product you wont be buying anything else. I am always buying different scrubs because my skin is very dry and i have mini blackheads and texture. i use this with my fresh products because my skin is very sensitive. Even though this is a chemical exfoliate it is much more gentle than those other scrubs that leave your face all red. You can actually see all the dead skin come off and fall in the sink as you slowly scrub. Ive got all of my family and friends buying it now!,1.0
I have been using this for over a year and it is the BEST moisturizer I’ve ever used. I won’t ever not use this again.,1.0
It felt nice going on and is a fun smell but 6 hours later my face was super greasy.  Blonde hair blue eyes pale skin - it’s not for me,0.0
Decently moisturizing but wouldn’t stay it’s much different from anything comparable. It does goes on very smoothly and doesn’t have a strong smell. I’m going to continue to use it - no breakouts or anything unusual happening. I did receive this complimentary for my honest opinion.,1.0
"I have been using this product for two weeks now. I use it once a week after cleansing my face. The good thing about this product is that it glides on smoothly and does not leave my face feeling dry and stiff like other clay masks. I haven’t really seen any improvements in terms of the size of my pores and when I have this mask on I don’t really see any sebum/oil that is being sucked out of my pores. Overall, not a bad product. #freeproduct",1.0
"(I paid for this product) I am not usually skin sensitive but Luna made me rethink that.. I followed the directions and applied Luna to my face, neck and décolletage. I had a little tingling on all 3 places BUT, I started swelling around my eyes. I took a cool face cloth and took off the product but it did not help. It stayed that way for 2 days.. I thought maybe it was something else sooo after the swelling went down. I applied it again, and the same thing happened so now I only use it on my neck and chest. I really like the product but be careful around the eyes.",1.0
"I usually don’t like to review a product, but this one surprised me. It is adsorbed by skin very well, applied before bed, the next morning my face was so soft and smooth. Smell good too.",1.0
"It’s not horrible but did not particularly love either.  My friend loved and raaaaved about this saying I needed this in my life so I got it. I gave it a try 2 times (a week apart) and both times, I ended up with tiny blemishes.  Nothing crazy but something was clogging my pores.",0.0

"I’d probably pay double for this product. it works amazingly well, rinses off easily, takes off all my make-up... Zero complaints. this will be my cleansing balm for as long as they make it.",1.0
I received this product as a feee sample. It leaves my face looking radiant.,1.0
"I needed this product for my skincare routine! I’m always skeptical when I see products with salicylic acid, but this product is great! It did break me out initially but that was just the product getting all the trapped stuff in my skin out to the surface. It does have a bit of a tacky consistency, but it does work well under my moisturizer. It did make my skin peel a little but only for the first week. It’s gotten rid of my textured acne and my skin is so smooth. Definitely recommend!",1.0
"This mask is amazing!  I use the whole Original Skin line from Origins, and this mask definitely isn’t something to skip out on!  I have large pores, so I don’t have a great skin texture.  Using this mask makes my skin feel so nice without being too harsh like some pore-reducing masks can be!  With this, you don’t have to worry about your face being red from irritation after use.  Also, the small beads in this mask makes washing it off feel like a dream!",1.0
love love love this serum... it’s by far the best chemical exfoliant serum I have ever used... highly recommend it... side note: if you are new to chemical exfoliants please start with lower concentration.,1.0
"Estee Lauder is timeless! I have used Estee Lauder for years be it cosmetics or their perfumes.I was so excited to be selected to receive thos product from influensters in exchange for my honest opinion and review I love the ease of application.  The cream glides on, is not heavy, oily, or greasy. The scent is not overpowering. I suffer from seasonal allergies and though this was not a miracle against the dark circles that come with allergies, it did help in making them less noticeable. My eye puffiness was reduced. I will be purchasing this in the future. My guess is that once allergy season has subsided that the results will be more visible but given it is helping tremendously now, I will continue to keep using it.",1.0
"I liked the way my skin felt after applying. It was not greasy or oily. It was hydrated feeling. I think the whipped gel-cream texture made this go on effortlessly. A little goes a long way. The Greek yoghurt ingredient makes it feel creamy, but it does not weigh your skin down.",1.0
"This is my third purchase of this moisturizer.  The packaging has definitely changed.  The quality of the plastic components feels cheaper and the lid doesn’t stay on as well.  The product itself also feels different.  I don’t know if it’s been reformulated, but it feels a lot thicker than before.  For such an expensive product, I’m disappointed that the quality of the packaging feels so cheap.  I may be moving on to try a different brand.",1.0
I loved this night eye cream. The texture leaves ur under eye feeling refreshed. Love the smell i would totally buy this product now that i have tried it,1.0
I love this! Gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. I got a sample from Tatcha’s main supply page and it’s lasted me over a year! A tiny amount goes a long way. Will purchase the full product once I run out.,1.0
Great presentation but zero results. The cream is velvety soft but I saw no difference in my facial skin.,0.0
"I’ve been using this product weekly for about 6 months now, and I am still on the fence about it.  If I eleminated it from my weekly skin care routine, would I miss it?  Probably not.  It is a bit harsh for my skin (I have rosacea and broken capillaries) and I don’t notice any significant improvement.  If you have sensitive skin like me, I would just stick to the D.E. TLC Framboos night serum (used once or twice per week), which is excellent.",1.0
"i live in a really dry state, and i usually use the really thick cera ve or vanicream to moisturize in the winter. i got a sample of this from sephora and used it to prep my really dry skin for makeup and it didn’t do anything weird under sunscreen, concealer and all the other stuff i put on my face. i didn’t feel tight or dry until way later in the day than normal for me so i know it helped to retain moisture throughout the day. i also have some slight lines and bad darkness under my eyes and i notice this perked them up a little bit so i always appreciate that. would recommend as a day and night moisturizer for someone who’s skin is as dry as mine (or who also lives in colorado)",1.0
"A solid serum. I thoroughly enjoy it for its hydration, the other claims not so much.",1.0
"a holy grail product in my skincare routine. be careful about how much you apply though, you’ll dry your skin out until it burns when you touch it lol",1.0
"All around great oil cleanser, I’ve used it a few times now and it’s able to remove all my makeup in one wash which I’m pretty impressed by. Sometimes it comes out as oil and sometimes balm (solid). Only downside is after working it in around my eyes, my eyesight is blurry for a  few minutes after.",1.0
"I really enjoy this face cleanser. It has a very mild smell, and doesn’t burn my skin or eyes. It’s very thick, so you don’t have to use much product to get a good creamy lather.",1.0
"I love all of Fresh Black Tea products so much! They work so well for my dry skin! I love the new Black Tea Age Renewal Cream that has star ingredients like Fresh’s BT Matrix with Black Tea and Rambutan, Ceramides, Pink Porcelain Lily, and Squalane. It is extremely nourishing and love that it doesn’t feel heavy or sticky on the skin!",1.0
Ｉ have already used the fresh cream for two weeks and it gave me a big surprise！Ｉ tend to be in the final step in the skin care with it in the morning and evening，after two weeks my skin is brighter than before！ To be honest，Ｉ really love the rose smell，it makes me feel comfort and relax.  You only need gently put in on your face then it will be quickly absorbed.,1.0
"I’m shook! I have tried the most expensive top of the line exfoliating products, invasive and noninvasive and this one blew me away! I’m a mature lady in my late 40’s and have some problems combating dull surface cells and clogged pores and within one use I could tell a difference. I never want to be without this product, so I used my Sephora card rewards and purchased the full sized set that comes with a refill. If you’re on the fence, just do it! This stuff is so gentle and effective, it does what a lot of expensive peels and toners do in a single use. My skin is glowing more each day with a natural luminosity that it hasn’t seen in years. It’s totally worth every penny as you don’t need very much.",1.0
If I could give this product 10 stars I would. I’m such a huda beauty fan. I love everything she makes. But this scrub is nothing short of what it’s described to do. It’s not harsh on your skin at all. I had some acne spots and this product helped to lighten it dramatically. It has a slight fragrance but it is not overpowering at all. I use this product 2-3 times weekly and it gives my skin such a glow. She needs to come out with more products.,1.0
I wanted to try this cream so I bought one of the small gift sets and I did really like it but I find it very similar to Belief’s aqua bomb. The texture is the same and they both keep your face moisturized until the morning. For the price I will probably be sticking with the aqua bomb.,1.0
"LOVE this product, I would re-buy again and again. I stopped using primer under my face products and just use this instead. The cooling aspect really helps calm and depuff and there is great hydration. Beautiful worn alone as well!!!",1.0
Very refreshing spray.,1.0
I received this as a complementary sample from influenster and I really like this moisturizer. The only thing I’m not a fan of is the smell. It is light and you dont have to use a lot just like a pea size amount did it for my whole face. It left my skin hydrated which I needed. I would probably buy it again. Although I would be looking for a different fragrance.,1.0
It just doesn’t work for me. I’ve used it at night and during the day and it just feels like overpriced colored vaseline that probably doesn’t stay on as long as vaseline would.,0.0
I really enjoyed this cream! It was super light and a little definitely goes a long way! I have never really used a moisturizer before and am now obsessed! I would definitely recommend all if you’re going to use a moisturizer try this one! Super light feeling with a fresh smell! I got it feee from influenster and will definitely purchase in the future!,1.0
"I am a dry skin type. For those that like a light cream, know that this is a thick cream moisturizer so it’s best for those that need and love hydration! The ultra facial cream is fragrance free and paraben free. I subtracted one star because it’s not as great as Tatcha Dewy (my favorite). The price is average and it’s great for men and women. I also received this product for free for testing purposes.",1.0

"Ok all I know is before I started my Lamer journey about 5 years ago, my skin was veryyyy sensitive, red, easily irritated so most medical grade moisturizers I couldn’t handle. So I bit the bullet and splurged. I did add the SK-II essence as well. That has been my routine now for years. NEVER HAD IRRITATION, ITCHINESS, REDNESS EVER AGAIN. It’s builds up your natural barrier if that makes sense. I’m early 40s now and I still get carded at the liquor store (total stretch but I giggle every time and I’ll take it! The last clerk told me “girlll whatever skin care routine you’re doing , keep it up”) ..sooo I’ll leave it at that. Does it seem like Nivea, sure but water the heck from the sea is in it, it does HEAL and PROTECT. I’m a believer:)",1.0
I’ve been on accutane recently which makes my skin super dry. This is a good product but definitely needs a thicker moisturizer over it,1.0
I have had horrible dry lips my whole life and have tried many chipsticks/balms and none compare to this one. It’s amazing. My only complaint it that with using it 2-3 times daily the product runs out fast for the price.,1.0
"This will renew your skin! I usually never follow through with treatments, but with this one you will see results by the first week. Buy the night serum to enhance and maintain the results.",1.0
"This was a birthday gift and I had been wanting to try it someday anyways. It makes my face feel SUPER soft after I use it and it really does help to brighten and clarify. I don’t use it everyday though. I use it about every two-three days. I think if it is used every day on skin that doesn’t have a lot of issues at first (if you’re not having a breakout, if you don’t have oily skin) or if you have dry and sensitive skin, I think it could really hurt. Everyday exfoliation seems silly from what I have been told about skincare and the skin cycle. Always listen to your body.",1.0
This toner is everything and it even smells soooo amazing. My skin feels clean and refreshed when I first put this on and it absorbs nicely into the skin. This toner is slightly thicker than other ones I have tried so I recommend patting it into your skin with your fingers instead of using a cotton pad.  Not to mention that the design and shape of the bottle is absolutely stunning - it feels like a nice heavy glass and the bottle is so cute and aesthetic. Everything about this product seems very well thought out! Anyways totally obsessed with sweet smelling toner - it’s so unique!,1.0
I love this. Have already bought this twice and have been using this for 2 years. My skin feels great 🥰smooth and shiny. I usually use it once a week or once in 2 weeks.,1.0

"If you have rosacea or redness in your skin you NEED this product in your life. This has replaced my daily moisturizer and primer since it has SPF already and evens out my skin tone. If you don’t feel like wearing foundation, this topped with a loose setting powder (I like the translucent one from Laura mercier) will make your skin look amazing and natural-it actually looks like your skin still but covers all the redness. If I have a serious breakout I can just spit conceal with a regular concealer and it all blends together just fine, again in a natural way. This is seriously my holy grail product!!",1.0
This face cleanser saved my skin!! I had very very dry skin and I would breakout because my skin was so dry and flakey from harsh face washes. When I started using this the difference was instant! My skin was so soft and not dry and tight feeling. Now my breakouts are way less and my makeup looks so much better!,1.0

I have combination skin. Halfway thru the day I get so oily.... I decided to try this under my makeup. What a game changer. It absorbs quickly and can take the place of a primer if you want to skip that step. I only use in the am under makeup. At night I use CT magic cream. I absolutely love this product.,1.0
"I’m not a huge essence/toner person as I don’t think they do much other than add a layer of hydration. HOWEVER, I really enjoy this toner’s texture, when they say it’s bouncy, it’s actually bouncy, there’s something to the application that adds a little bonus to my routine. I recommend if you have combination skin and are trying to combat the dryness of acne products. I received a sample version of this product through Influenster.",1.0
"It is one of my favorite creams before makeup, it leaves your skin like a soft canvas and ready to receive your makeup, it leaves your skin as silky as porcelain, it helps you with hydration to keep your makeup in place throughout the day As you can see I always buy mine in a mini size but I’m very happy to have received this size because I love it",1.0
Great product. Not too heavy but makes my skin feel healthy and glowy.,1.0
It’s supposed to change from green to beige but it doesn’t change at all on my skin. It stays greasy and rubs off. I look like an alien after an hour still and have to wash off. I don’t understand how more people don’t have this issue.,0.0
"I got a sample tube of this in my Allure Subscription Box this month. I’ve really come to favor Caudalie products, so I was excited to try another serum from them. I happened to have a couple of small blemishes on my chin when this arrived, so it was perfect timing! This worked really well as a spot treatment and quickly calmed and cleared my skin. Although I have dry skin and don’t deal with acne issues regularly, I think this makes a fabulous spot treatment without being as drying as other, harsher products. It has a really light natural scent, like many of Caudalie’s products. I’m not sure I will use this often enough to buy the full size, but I’m sure many with oily or combination skin would do well to invest in it. Also, if you have dry skin like me- I highly recommend trying Caudalie’s Radiance Serum. I got it in my Sephora Play bag this month and it is absolutely my new favorite serum for both hydrating and brightening!",1.0
An absolute staple. Helps me look alive in the dead of winter and amplifies any sun-kissed glow in the summer!,1.0
LOVE. I got bought this after a friend recommended it to me and was skeptical to say the least. I have incredibly acne prone/oily skin and was concerned this product would leave me even more shiny but it does not! It absorbs beautifully and makes makeup application seamless. The best part - people have been saying my skin looks good and that I seem rested!! That’s a win in my book!,1.0
Feels super smooth upon contact to the skin. It’s not a greasy product at all.  I love how it’s all natural and feels refreshing.    The first time using the product my skin felt fresh and smooth.,1.0
"This is actually a really nice product. I use it every third night, only at night. And use retinol, salicylic acid and other BHA and AHA products on different nights. I cleanse, apply this and moisturize and I’ve notice some lightening of my skin tone and some hyperpigmentation going away. I do not have very sensitive skin, I have oily, acne prone skin.",1.0
I really love the texture and it really leaves my skin clean and soft!,1.0
"So, this supposed to be the holy grail, right?  Well, not exactly.  It’s more like the holy grail for your mother or grandmother.  Does it moisturizer?  Yes.  Does it work better than many?  Absolutely.  But it’s main ingredients are mineral oil and petroleum, which are terrible for your skin.  That’s that only reason it keeps your skin so soft (and why you need so little).  Skincare has come so far over the years and this just doesn’t cut it.",0.0
This helped my dry skin tremendously!! Will be repurchasing!,1.0
Love how this makes my skin feels. It’s very fine powder that creates a pretty nice paste. It exfoliates my skin without feeling too harsh like some other brand I have tried. It’s easy to use and I notice the difference. I received this complimentary from Dermalogica,1.0
One of my favorite cleansers! So refreshing and energizing!,1.0
This is basically magic water. My skin is so moisturized after starting to use this and brighter. Obsessed but wish I could afford this always. The packaging is sleek. I would definitely recommend this to friends  I received this product as a free sample for testing purposes,1.0
"I know this is supposed to be used at night, but I use it CONSTANTLY throughout the day. It keeps my lips so soft and hydrated, and since a tiny bit goes a long way one of these little pots lasts you forever!",1.0
"I have extremely sensitive, dry skin that often times becomes flaky during the winter time. This scrub is so gentle, and my skin did not react poorly to it at all. After just one use, I noticed a difference in my skin! It’s visibly brighter and no longer dry and flaky. LOVE LOVE LOVE! My new go-to scrub!",1.0
"Skin fix gifted me the barrier + triple lipid peptide cream in exchange for my honest opinion. It comes in light blue packaging with the pump out dispenser up top that ensures do you use up the product it to the last drop. This face cream is designed for normal to dry and sensitive skin and claims to use its 3% triple lipid clump complex to help support your skin‘s barrier from within and also helps support your skins natural elasticity.I love when companies and products that I regularly use have eco-friendly packaging. Skinfix’s box is made from 100% recycled or reclaimed  fiber and the products are clean, cruelty free and vegan or beegan. The cream has a rich consistency and is highly moisturizing. It has no fragrance and does not take too long to absorb into my skin. My skin looks visibly more radiant when I wake up the next day. It’s the perfect hydration for my fall and winter skin care routine and is sure to be staple.",1.0
"i have only had this for a week and i already see a difference in my spots and it gives you such a dewy, healthy look. it made my skin extremely soft as well",1.0
"For the price, I’m uncertain if this is worth it. There was a slight difference in the complexion of my skin. More vibrant, however, not enough for me to incorporate it into my night time routine. I like to invest in skin care, but this is little too much for the amount you get. I received this in a voxbox as a complimentary sample.",0.0
"I use this once a week, the results are almost instant. It’s so refreshing and light, it doesn’t leave any residue or discoloration. Definitely a must!",1.0
LOVE IT!I really loved the deep cleaning of this face cleanser. I felt that it really worked well and every time I used it I felt as if I was getting a really good clean. I got complimented on my skin my a male friend and I know it was due to how nicely this cleanser left my skin afterwards. I loved the way it changed from a lotion into foam. I would definitely recommend this foaming cream cleanser. I received this product this product complimentary for testing.,1.0
I have been using this moisturizer for the last couple weeks and I absolutely love it! It is perfect for my dry skin. It is great as a primer before applying makeup. This moisturizer is overall good for your skin and is now a staple in my everyday routine.,1.0
This is amazing! I have tried so many different products from my extremely chapped lips. I’ve tried products that swear up-and-down they will relieve my chapped lips and they did nothing. This product I mostly use that as a normal lip balm. I wanted at night a few times I don’t notice that much of a difference but as a lip balm? It’s the best.,1.0
"I was skeptical of this product, because it is pretty pricey, but have been very impressed! This is a wonderful, gentle exfoliant. It goes on like a lotion. It’s has a mild citrusy smell that I really like, but it goes away quickly after applying. I’ve been applying at night several times a week, on the nights I don’t apply retinol, and I noticed a difference even after the first application the following morning. My skin was clearer looking, and it even helped some acne that was trying to start. It helps minimize my pores and even out my skin’s appearance. I do wish this wasn’t so expensive so I’ve docked a star due to the price. It does come in some swank packaging.",1.0
this magic cream leaves your face so glowy and moisturized it feels like a baby skin!  this is my go to moisturizer now and I will never change it!,1.0
"This is my new holy grail. Super thick and crazy hydrating without leaving you greasy. I also have very sensitive skin and this has not given me any problems whatsoever - it’s like a hug for my sensitive skin, honestly. My skin has never looked better.",1.0
HOLY GRAIL - WILL FOREVER PURCHASE. Amazing for my sensitive skin. I love it so much.,1.0
I love how weightless this feels on my skin and how much it really does give my face hydration!,1.0
I have sensitive skin and for me this sunscreen was very good I liked how it got on my skin. The consistency is good and the smell is good too. I liked,1.0
"Receieved a small package from #topboxcircle #trywithtopbox . I’m always into Hyaluronic acid, because it just perfect for my skin type. But I can’t really tell of this works well or not. Not enough amount to try for at least a whole month.",1.0
"Not sure how the full size packaging is like, but the sample size tube had a bit of a learning curve to it since the product is as thin as water. After experimenting how much to squeeze to get the amount I want, the product gave the glow that it promised. This also has the best scent from a Vitamin C serum of all the ones I’ve tried so far (either chemically, scent free, or funky). It doesn’t smell like artificial oranges, but has a soapy light clean fragrance. It applies like the most watery serum and under moisturizer and some CC cream I can tell there is a subtle hydrated glow.",0.0
"I absolutely love the smell of this serum. I received a 7 day sample complimentary from Influenster and Clayton’s in exchange for my honest review. This serum left my skin feeling smooth, soft and radiant. The smell just makes me feel energized! Love putting this on in the morning. Definitely worth a try!",1.0
So moisturizing! One of my favorite toners! Looking forward to trying the rest of the watermelon line.,1.0
"This has been a part of my daily skincare routine for almost two years now, so figured it was time to write a review. This is a holy grail product for me. I have very dry, acne prone, sensitive skin. I use this every day in place of foundation (and SPF on normal days, though I add an additional SPF 50 when I plan to be outside for more than an hour). Leaves my skin fully hydrated, glowing, and even all day. Layers well under makeup if you need more coverage.",1.0
Really was impressed with this. Feels nice and isn’t a thick moisturizer. I don’t like the shape of sample container lid but it’s easy to control amount you want.,1.0
"Horrible packaging.  I don’t know why DE makes such convoluted cheap plastic packaging.  It has a narrow opening and a tube that attached through to the dispenser and the tube came off and I can’t get it out due to the small size of the bottle neck.  So this was actually four times as expensive, given how much is left in the bottle.  The smoothing effect on my skin wasn’t worth the cost and waste.",0.0
LOVEEEE this moisturizer!!!! It’s sooo soothing and creamy and feels like a dream on the skin. It helped repair my skins moisture barrier once winter rolled around. My makeup sits so much better with this on.,1.0
I am very excited that i received this product to review for free and a HUDA BEAUTY skin product at that. This face enzyme scrub was an essential addition to my skin care routine because instead of a harsh exfoliant this brang gentle yet effective results and i noticed a difference on the 1st use and i love the smell and the as the circular motions u start getting the dead skin cells balling up and its so satisfying to me to see my face ridding of all the dull dead skin and being left with nice clean bright skin. .....,1.0
I love this face wash. I received it complimentary for testing and review purposes and I loved it. It felt good on my skin and didn’t leave it feeling dry or with a film on my face,1.0
"Bought this because my skin has been so dry this winter. Been using it for less than two weeks and haven’t had a dry patch since, so it’s doing exactly what I need! However, I read reviews before buying about the smell and decided to buy anyways. It literally smells so horrible upon application. I can’t even describe it but it is bad. Luckily it goes away after a few seconds, but truly stinks so bad when rubbing it in.",1.0
"While this cream did moisturize and didn’t make me feel oily, I did not like the scent and it made me break out.",0.0
"Ok... So wow! Amazing. The smoothest plumpest skin I’ve ever had. Like ever. And I’m 48. I’ve used TCA. glycolic. Lactic. Mandelic.  ALL of it and Tho I’ve  gotten great results, this was magical. Swoon! I was hesitant at the price tag on this one but I figured between me and my teenage daughter we’ll appreciate it. Can’t wait for her to try it!! She gets concentrated breakouts in the T-zone but I’m sure it will clear up her skin!",1.0
"I loved this product! Immediately after using this, my skin has felt extremely soft and resurfaced. Like a new glowy layer was developed. After 3 days, I noticed my skin care I put on after this was working a lot faster than it normally does. I did receive this product free from influenster for testing purposes but all of my opinions are my own.",1.0
I received this #freeproduct from #Topbox to try and give my honest review.Used it only a couple of days at night. The eye cream went on smoothly and absorbed quickly into my skin. It did not have a noticeable scent. I like Clinque products in general.,1.0
"Really wanted to like this ! as i love all their other products. BUT this made me even more oily , and caused me to break out !!!!! it does make your skin soft , but not worth the price tag",0.0
I love how clean my skin looks and feels after using this Ren toner. It helps with the size of my pores and is now part of my skincare routine. A small amount goes a long way and I love that it is a vegan product.,1.0
"I’m loving this product! My skin is baby smooth after using it. In addition, my skin was noticeably clearer immediately. It does not burn, but there is a light tingle. For me the tingle was a 2/10.",1.0
"Best makeup remover out there! I’ve always hated using anything but makeup wipes because it would always seap into my eyes and burn them but this doesn’t and it takes everything (including waterproof mascara) off almost in an instant, it’s incredible and if you haven’t tried it YOU NEED TO!",1.0
"Disclaimer: Bzz Agent review of free product to try first.That being said, this exfoliant is AWESOME! I was a little thrown, at first, because it’s a powder that comes out of a regular looking (liquid facial care product) bottle, but maybe that was the only way to keep moisture out of the powder between uses? I was also unsure about how difficult (& wasteful, effective, etc...) a powder exfoliant, that I mix with water, in my hand, in the shower would be. As it turned out, being able to “adjust“ the exfoliant to water ratio makes this ideal for daily use, plus it’s easy to do, with very little waste (none that I could even see)! My face has felt soft after every shower, and, starting with the first day I used it, I’ve noticed small areas where impurities are coming to the surface. Not a major breakout, or blackheads, just subtle, tiny, painless, no-one-else-would-notice spots. Dermalogica does an amazing job of balancing innovation with simplicity! This is a unique product that will make anyone happy they gave it a try, and I really hope you do!",1.0
Really gorgeous base for makeup! It glides in so smoothly and just feels as luxurious as it looks. Very hydrating and keeps the skin plump so amazing for this cold winter weather! I would use sparingly if you have combo oily skin like I do!,1.0
"Ça prend juste une toute petite quantité, et en frottant ça crée une belle mousse. Tout frais, exactement le feeling qu’on veut quand on se lave le visage.",1.0
I received this as a #freeproduct. I only received enough to use for about a week so I can’t comment on its effectiveness. I used this serum only during the day. I liked the consistency of it and doesn’t have a smell. It didn’t leave my face feeling sticky like other serums. It paired really well with the Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream.,1.0
"I love this essence. It is perfect for my combination sensitive skin. It absorbs well and it is not greasy at all, it’s actually a very light refreshing feeling. This fits perfectly into my daily routine and I just wish it wasn’t so expensive :(",1.0
So happy they came out with this oil! It gives hydration and all provides a glow which is exactly what I look for from my products. #skincaregoals.I received this product to review from Influenster but my opinions are my own.,1.0
Absolutely as good as everybody says . Hydrating and perfect package. Doesn’t smell to mush and leave the skin fresh,1.0
"I have friends that adore this moisturizer, but it dried me out! It didn’t irritate my skin, or cause any break outs, just left my skin feeling tight and dry. I have combo skin that gets the occasional cystic acne around my jaw during my time of the month. Was hoping to find a good moisturizer for the winter but this seems to do the opposite.",0.0
"For reference, I’m 15 with combo (leaning towards oily) skin. These clogged my pores so badly. I used these for about a week, and now I have blackheads all over my forehead, and my skin is just overall oilier. On top of breaking me out, they also had no noticeable effect.",0.0
This sunscreen is so beautiful! Make up sits perfectly on top of it or it’s beautiful on its own. I’ve worn this outside in 100+ degree heat and not only did I not burn but it stayed all day without melting off or breaking up.,1.0
"This very much reminds me of a chapstick for the face. There is little to no smell to this product which is good for those with sensitivities. It creates a moisturizing barrier upon application and the hydration lasts for quite a while. I’ve tried it on top of makeup and was not a fan it smeared my makeup and made the product gross. I think my main issue was that it wasn’t as emollient as I would have liked for it to have been, it is truly the consistency of a hard chapstick. That being said, I definitely feel this product is of good quality and has its uses. For example, I think is is great to apply under your eyes before concealer or to lock it a moisturizer. It is also great to apply to the high points of your face on no makeup days to look healthy and glowing. Living in Florida I don’t think this would be a go to product for me but if I were in a colder climate I could certainly see a need for this. This product was provided to me complimentary from Influenster.",1.0
this is an amazing sunblock to use before make up it has a blurring affect pore filling it doesnt feel greasy at all and no white cast its really great and i love how its spf 40i know im getting the right amount of spf!!,1.0
I love this Cleanser. It’s been helping with my occasional acne and leaves my skin more clear then a lot of other products that I use. Definitely would recommend if you occasionally get acne or skin problems,1.0
"I received this sample from Influencer and Estée Lauder for free for my honest review. The size of the gel-creme was enough to appreciate the light scent, smooth application, and lovely feeling of the product on my skin. I’m afraid it wasn’t enough to truly provide feedback on longer use results. My skin felt hydrated each morning and the product did not irritate my skin. I would be curious about the results a full-size product would make on my skin with continued use.",1.0
"i recieved this item from influenster. It feels nice on the skin, but the smell is pretty bad!",0.0
"This is such an amazing cleanser & truly makes your skin feel baby soft! Just for more info a cream cleanser is more targeted for dry skin, but as for myself I have oily skin & I enjoyed it!",1.0
Woke up to a baby soft smoother skin! I plan to use this product every other day to have great skin! Thank you Fresh! You’ve done it again!!,1.0
"This product is, hands down, the best exfoliator I have ever tried. I generally exfoliate 2-3 times a week and have tried MANY. This scrub is applied to dry skin and then you simply rub gently in circles. I COULD NOT BELIEVE how much dead skin came off my face Initially, I had gotten this product as a sample item and I immediately ordered the full size. Now, I only have to use it 1-2 times a week and it leaves my skin soft and glowing. Finally, I have extremely sensitive skin and this product didn’t bother me at all.",1.0
I love this cleanser it’s perfect for in the morning washing my face I wouldn’t count on it to clean off all my makeup at the end of the day but I’m the morning is perfect,1.0
I love all of Drunk Elephants products and this one is no exception I will buy it again,1.0
Honestly it’s pretty good so far however Got this as a gift and I wish it came with a few more items other then that so far it seems good I think it should have been made as a spray bottle I took a star off because it’s messy and not easy to apply. Other then that i know rice is very good not sure if it’s worth 109$ but still good.,1.0
"This product feels amazing on your skin! It is very moisturizing and smooth. It has a pleasant smell as well. It lasts a long time and truly feels good applied to your face and neck. I can tell it works and would highly recommend this, especially in the winter/dry months.  I am a fan and will continue to buy this cream.",1.0
I wasn’t happy with this product. used it for almost a month and I’ve seen no change on my skin whatsoever. My skin feels dry. looks too much like the toner. very pricy as well. I will definitely not be buying this product.,0.0
I was not anticipating loving this so much. This is very moisturizing but blends well and I cold immediately tell my skin was more firm. It has a pleasant scent but it isn’t overwhelming and didn’t really linger.,1.0
"I really do not like this Serum. I wanted to like it so badly because I love every Tatcha product (especially their Dewy Purple Line), but this product was really hard to love. This serum did nothing for me. If anything it was more of a heavy moisterizer than a “serum“. I don’t understand the purpose of this serum but it’s basically just a thick moisterizer if that’s what you’re looking for. Don’t waste your money, there’s better serums out there.",0.0
Been using it everyday. Stays in my bag. Makes lips feel soft and buttery.,1.0
This cleanser is so gentle yet effective. It has such a nice lather as a foam cleanser and it has a light fragrance that does not linger. This didn’t irritate my sensitive dry skin and it didn’t be leave my skin feeling tight. I received a mini size for complimentary purposes to test,1.0
I receive this 7-day sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. This powder is amazing. The particles are not too big so it exfoliates my skin gently and cleans my pores in the T zone very well. My T zone produce less oil in the day time which is a significant improvement for me.,1.0
my sister loves this so i tried it… my skin has never been more dry. literally flaky dry— even my eyelids? not a fan.,0.0
"as someone who’s adult acne has gotten so bad the last couple of years and has extremely oily skin, this is a life saver! it has definitely helped with breakouts and how oily my skin is. my skin needed to build up a tolerance to it, i gave myself a tiny chemical burn by just putting it on morning and night every day, i went from 3x a week to every night. love this. pictures attached are a month apart.",1.0
"Obsessed with this vegan brand!! Honestly I had no idea what to expect but it definitely is one of my favorite moisturizers I’ve tried in a while. It feels kind of like gel when you put it on, but absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily feel like most other deep moisturizers. The packaging is equally chic with a little spreader.  Product: Amazing that they provide a deep dive into the key ingredients and what they’re known for. This product touts healing herbs used to treat stress, anxiety and exhaustion, herbs to boost skin strength, fight fatigue and increase resistance/reduce effects of stress.",1.0
"This product is amazing. I use it day and night, and it leaves me feeling super moisturized, without any of the oily slickness that I get from other moisturizers. My skin has been soaking this up and loving it.",1.0
"This sunscreen is soo nice! First, you’ll have to make sure to shake it, because it had apparently separated and was initially runny. I really love the fact that this is clear and doesn’t leave the dreaded white-cast, but has a high SPF. Another positive note is that this also doesn’t have that typical, heavy,  sunscreen scent. This is more subtle, and fresh.",1.0
I absolutely love this Belif Aqua Bomb Overnight Lip Mask! It’s super hydrating and perfect for the winter months. I love that it’s not sticky and has no scent. Definitely recommend trying it out especially if you’re prone to having chapped lips!,1.0
Helped when I had bad acne. A good value. Something that I think I should always have in my skin products collection.,1.0
this product was sent to me cplimentary from influenster and olehrenriksen for testing purposes. this is a dream chemical expholiant. you’ll definitely see a difference in your face after a few uses. my dark spots are much lighter and my skin feels like a dream after every use. love love love!!!,1.0
Definitely my favorite product from this brand! I use this every day and notice how hydrated my face looks after! The packaging is practical and great for traveling. I really enjoy this product and will be purchasing when I run out. I received this product for free to review.,1.0
I really like this sunscreen. It goes into skin easily and doesn’t leave a white cast. I also like the ingredients. I received this complimentary from Influenster.,1.0
"I sadly only had a limited supply of this product to try but I did love it. It was oily yes but once applied it absorbed into the skin, which meant my skin did not stay oily. Provided great hydration.",1.0
I dis not see the oily gone or being controlled. Caused me more swallowing acne. Not recommend,0.0
"I instantly noticed a difference when using this serum. My skin feels more hydrated, bouncy and smooth. The applicator dispenses the perfect amount of product and it has a really nice light fresh scent to it. I highly recommend!",1.0
"I’ve been using this product for almost a month now and I can honestly say it works! I only use this product in the evening and apply it to my skin using a cotton round. I also make sure to wear a sunscreen during the day. The product has a nice smell that isn’t too strong or overwhelming. My skin is usually pretty clear with occasional breakouts. I noticed a difference in my skin after one use - my skin was smoother. After regular use, I can say this product does brighten your skin and even out skin texture. I consider myself as having sensitive skin, but this product works if you follow the instructions! Overall, I’m satisfied with this product!",1.0
My skin love it more then Good GenesThe best!!,1.0
"I believe I was one of the unlucky gals who broke out do to this toner. I’ve been using it every day, twice a day for about 2 months now, and I’ve had a steady set of pimples all over. More recently, it’s been burning my face to put on. I just stopped a few products that I suspected was causing my breakouts and this happened to be the one. Love the rose scent and how refreshing it is, but I didn’t notice anything really hydrating about it.",0.0
"I wanted to love this so much.  A YouTuber I watch always raves about it so I bought this off his recommendation and how high it’s always rated.  TERRIBLE.  I have sensitive acne prone skin and After two uses I had a scaley texture, discoloration, and redness to my skin.  If you want to try it and you have sensitive skin try the small travel size first.  Such a disappointment.",0.0
My skin was clear and calm aftet the first application with Buffet by The Ordinary,1.0
"When I ran out of my Nexcare Acne patches I ordered these. Am not at all impressed. After trying them out on several white heads over night I can say the only plus is that they really stick to your face. Other than that, they don’t work that well. I’ll use them up and move on to a different brand.",0.0
"I received a free sample of the Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturizer from Influenster and absolutely loved it for my dry skin. It is a gel formula and goes on smoothly. It absorbed quickly into my skin and did not cause any irritation with the few uses in the tube I was provided. It is not scented either which is important to me in a moisturizer. Not only did this give my skin a natural glow on its own, but it worked well under all my other skincare and did not pill or cause any weird interactions with my other products or foundation. I found this moisturizer kept my makeup looking better throughout the day by keeping my skin hydrated. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this moisturizer to any fellow dry skin sufferers. I’d definitely invest in a full size!",1.0
I l o v e this product! I’ve been eyeballing it for a while and I’m so glad I finally purchased! I love using it in the morning as a little wake me up. So soothing.,1.0
"I was sent this product to review through influenster and I was pleasantly surprised, It worked very well on my skin and helped with my sun spots. My only complaint would be the consistency is a bit uncomfortable the first few times you use it but you get used to it.",1.0
This is great. Gives just the right amount of glow for a sun kissed look. Easy to apply without streaks,1.0
Very nourishing. Would only use at night though. Extremely oily texture and takes a while to absorb,1.0
"I don’t leave reviews often, but I love this stuff. I saw a Youtuber use it in her skincare routine and meant to pick it up. I didn’t realize it was Korean skincare and almost missed it in-store. It comes with a reusable applicator which is a great bonus. It feels so smooth and hydrating and smells like bubblegum. I think it’ll last me a long time, so great purchase for the price!",1.0
I’ve bun using this for the last 15 days and honestly I don’t think it’s I’ve seen much of any change. I really like the scent of it.  It feels lovely on my skin.  It also leave my skin with a nice glo nothing overbearing.  I honestly think i need more time using this product to see some results that’s why I took one star off. I also received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I look forward to seeing some sort of results within an 8 week period.,1.0
"It was super easy to use. Most glycolic acids tend to be harsh, but this wasn’t. It didn’t irritate my skin, and was gentle but effective. I woke up the next morning, and did notice a glow to my skin. This I will definitely repurchase.",1.0
I can’t live without these! They really do make a huge difference over night and I’ve tried ALOT of different acne products.,1.0
Smells divine.. not too strong not too light… perfect for my dry skin,1.0
"This stuff is so amazing. After using it, I couldn’t stop touching my face because of how soft and clean it felt. I have sensitive-ish combo skin that prone to redness and dry patches so I was hesitant to try it, but i am so glad I did. I will definitely be ordering this in a larger size. I got this in a Sephora play box, or as a sample, and I’ve had it in my drawer for a couple of months. My only regret is I didn’t get it on my face earlier. It’s magnificent.",1.0
"These feel and smell so good! They don’t make my face flake like some wipes do. Gentle all the way, from the texture of the cloth to the makeup remover. I use them sometimes during the day if I’m not wearing makeup to refresh my skin and remove dirt and oil.",1.0
"I am obsessed with this self tanner and have been raving about it. I am fair-medium skinned toned. I simply mix 3-5 drops with my everyday moisturizer then apply. I do the same for my face. I apply twice a week usually and feel like I have a nice healthy tan. I prefer to put it on after showering at night. I let it dry a couple minutes (like normal lotion) and put on pajamas. No transfer to my sheets at all! The first time I applied I had a streak on my arm which was from poor application. Since-nothing! Even tan, even on knees and elbows. I do not break out from this, the smell is minimal in my opinion, and the bottle lasts me 2ish months. I’m surprised by the mixed reviews because I’m picky! Highly recommend, buy it now, and buy two because it sells out in hours!",1.0
"love it, use it everyday to take off makeup. gets everything off and isnt drying to the skin.",1.0
This product is amazing! I have decently dry skin with pretty visible pores and this oil hydrates my skin while reducing the look of my pores. I also struggle with pretty red skin and this oil evens out my completion and reduces any irritation I have very well! 100% reccomend!!,1.0
Really helps even out the redness of my skin. I love how dewy and hydrated my skin looks and feels. Just wish I could afford it more often!,1.0
I love this! I will definitely be buying this in the future. I noticed a great change in my skin and it was feeling extra soft. Five stars!,1.0
I received this #freeproduct from TopBox. This absorbed nicely into the skin and was non-greasy. I received a sample of this and it wasn’t enough product to speak on the long-term effects. I wouldn’t purchase a full-sized jar of this because it didn’t do anything out of the ordinary for this much use.,1.0
"This WORKS. I gave 4 stars because it doesn’t always get the oil out, your zit has to be “ready” for it. But when it works, it works really well and gets the oil out.",1.0
Caused me to break out!!! Did more research and just because it’s a higher % doesn’t mean it’s better,0.0
"This primer is pure luxury! It has the feel of a silky veil on your skin, definitely blurs imperfections under makeup. 4 stars only because it isn’t hydrating enough on its own. The refillable packaging genius! I would definitely splurge on this again.",1.0

Whitehead and blackheadsThis cleanser has helped to clear up my skin of breakouts while still being gently overall on my skin. Since becoming a mom, my skin has gone through a lot of changes including not reacting to previously used products in a positive way. This includes going through multiple products (from Clean and Clear to Shiseido) and this is the first one that took care of my overarching concerns. I still feel like my skin is slightly dull at times or not as even, but I don’t fault this cleaner for that and I working out a new skin care routine to help nurture my skin. My skin is sensitive and its been fairly gentle but I also use probably slightly less than what is expected. The product does have fragrance listed as the last ingredients so if that is an issue for you, please be aware. To me it smells a little like medicated soap / minty but I don’t mind it",1.0
I have really dry skin and this product works wonders!!!!! I’m obsessed,1.0
This stuff makes my lips feel heavenly.  I work as a dog walker and use this as chapstick while I’m working on frigid temps and it really protects my lips. It is very glossy. It doesn’t really have a taste but smells delicious. I bought the new Tatcha lip mask and was utterly disappointed. This is my holy grail for lip care!,1.0
"I am so excited to discover an oil-free cream suited for aging skin that doesn’t feel greasy or clog my pores. My skin is well hydrated, and feels healthy. The formula goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and works nicely with my other skincare products. I received a deluxe sample, which I don’t think is sufficient to see significant results in wrinkle reduction, but I did like the product well enough to purchase a larger size now that my sample is almost gone.",1.0
"It feels great and it smells so good! It feels great when you’ve just gotten out of the shower, the serum cools down the skin and makes it soft! It has made a long lasting soft effect on my face, and for me, it did not cause me to break out, so do not worry of that.",1.0
"I used up this product. And it did literally nothing to me. Didn’t smooth my texture. Didn’t help to clarify my skin. Didn’t make my face softer. Didn’t control the acnes. Literally, nothing. Really disappointed.",0.0
Will permanently stain your sheets/pillowcases yellow.,0.0
I love this eye cream it doesn’t irritate my eyes. I received it complementary from Influenster.,1.0
I received this product complimentary for testing. I absolutely love this product. It is just enough of an exfoliation without feeling like you’re tearing your skin off. The packaging is super cute as well,1.0
The Serum Stick is hands down the best thing ever invented!!!,1.0
"This cleansing balm works very well for removing make-up and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have sensitive, redness prone skin and this has never given me a reaction.  I wish they would come out with more products in this line.",1.0
"I don’t get the hype around DE. Who is their target audience? Young adults that cannot afford their products or more mature people that are put off by their juvenile packaging? This is an okay moisturizer, absolutely nothing outstanding, for the price I expected much, much more. I’m going back to Tatcha and Estee Lauder.",0.0
"This is my third bottle. I keep switching to something else thinking I need to see what else is out there, and then I would come back to this.",1.0
This lip mask is amazing! I used it for a few days and my dry cracked lips instantly felt and looked better! 10 out of 10 would recommend,1.0
I like this moisturizer because I like that it doesn’t make my face look super oily. I even like it because it I could wear it with primer or none and put my foundation.,1.0
I didn’t hate this product but I have skin that likes the same old same ol and any major change will normally cause texture in my cheek area. It applied pretty sticky and if I used it every other or every third day it added a nice glow but any more than that and my skin really didn’t like it. Smell is a plus though - might be strong for some folks.,0.0
"I have used this product before but it was just a tiny bottle. When I found this package they had the bigger bottle on here, i absolutely love this sunscreen I have dry skin this sunscreen doesn’t leave a scaly appearance and No white residue and its Gives my skin a shimmery glow! This one is just like a lotion, absorbing quickly and going on smoothly. We used it on the beach and no one got burned. It’s a bit pricey but completely worth it. I’ll probably continue to use it as my daily facial moisturizer under my make up throughout the year. Thank you, @shiseido and keep making this product its amazing.#shiseidoSunscreen #contest #complimentary @shiseido @influenster",1.0
I LOVE this moisturizer! Very light and airy to the skin. I have also tried the dewy skin cream and recommend this one more! I also love the little spatula that comes with it 😁,1.0
"Love this product!! I’m obsessed with having soft lips and this really works! The consistency is great, not too gooey and tacky but you can still feel it on your lips. The packaging is beautiful (and btw, EVERY jarred lip balm should come with an applicator like this one!) and it smells great too. Not one complaint",1.0
"Clinique has never been my favorite brand for skincare. All of their products lack results and quality. This is by far one of the worst products I’ve ever put on my face. My face was beaming red after application. After 30 minutes of redness and application, my face got so dried up and felt like a desert. I was disgusted. And the following the day, I suffered with many mini breakouts all over my face, it must be the mineral oil. This was bad.",0.0
this was gifted to me by Supergoop. I have recently started to love this brand and it helps that it’s actually good for your skin!  I got this shade to kind of help keep me a little bronzey rather than a whiter cast,1.0
There I said it. It smells like feet. It’s super rich but the smell is to off putting.,0.0
I received the mini Drunk Elephant moisturizer and cleaner set as a birthday gift in April and I am obsessed. The cleanser is gentle but still has just a little bit of lather and the Polypeptide Moisturizer makes my face so incredibly smooth and soft.  I was sad that the large 50ML size was so expensive but I wasn’t quite surprised.  I love it and will just have to save my pennies so I can get some more when I run out of the sample.,1.0
This was the first product I’ve tried from Sunday Riley and it deserves 5 stars.  The formula is jam packed with my favorite ingredients. I love eye creams with retinoids as they are formulated to work on the delicate eye area and this has a nice percentage. I think the addition of centella is pretty smart as my eyes can get irritated at times and this has helped. The packaging is perfect for applying eye cream. It’s convenient and easy to use.  The texture is a light weight cream gel that absorbs quickly and leaves no residue. I’ve been using this for awhile and my eye area is smoother. Can’t wait to see the long term effects.,1.0
"I have cystic-acne prone skin that isn’t oily or dry, it’s in between. I’ve had no luck with creamy/lotion moisturizers so i decided to give this a shot and im glad i did. It keeps my skin hydrated for HOURS and hasn’t caused any breakouts. I have to wear a mask for 8-9 hours a day and im not a greasy mess when i take it off",1.0
Such a great luxe feeling to put this on at night before bed...feels like I’m injecting and IV of moisture into my skin...and live the scent and feel too,1.0
I have sensitive skin and get rough patches on my forehead. This is a very mild powder that you mix with a little water and gently exfoliate your face.  It does not irritate me at all and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I would recommend!,1.0
"Skin has felt amazing since using this. A little goes a long way. I have very oily skin, but it gets red and dry easily, this has helped with all 3 issues. Doesn’t break me out. Using the Virgin Marula Oil with this is a huge plus.",1.0
"As a girl from Florida, sunscreen is important all year around. The convenience of a stick is so great for touch ups OR putting over your makeup! This sunscreen is great for my sensitive skin. I can use this on my face or body. I received this as a free sample for my honest review. Please remember skin health IS important.  anything less than 50 is a waste. A must have.",1.0
"I have very sensitive skin and after years of trying various OTC, prescription, and Sephora products, I have finally found a cleanser that is gentle and keeps my skin clean and clear. I love that I can use this to double cleanse and it gets all of my makeup off without any stinging or burning. I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.",1.0
"This product is amazing. The texture is very nice and really helped my skin. Oh, and it smells super yummy!",1.0
I enjoyed this product. It really help to reduce the size of my pores. Once again another great product from Dr. Dennis Gross.,1.0
"This product is fantastic, it is great for fair skin to use a base of you will to then apply bronzer or blush to for a light and great feeling everyday look.",1.0
"Do not recommend this at all for people with sensitive skin!! I have combo dry skin don’t like heavy creams so I chose this cream to try. First few nights, I got mild irritations and bumps around my forehead/hairline, I stopped for almost 2 weeks. The other night I reach for it again and OMG the next morning my face is all itchy and full of breakouts.",0.0
"Nice color, unfortunately the consistency is not good. It wears off immediately so needs constant reapplying.",0.0
This eye cream is so nice!! I love the applicator on it! It feels so nice under my eyes. I haven’t really used retinoid in my skincare before this but it has niacinamide and my skin LOVES niacinamide!! I’m so happy with this product!,1.0
"This stuff is dreamy! My skin is hydrated and glowing in the middle of a cold and dry winter. Aside from smelling heavenly, this mask feels velvety smooth. Pro Tip: keep it in the fridge for a super COOL d.i.y. spa treatment!",1.0
I love the creamy texture of this Jet Lag Mask! It applies smoothly and doesn’t feel like a regular mask as it’s so moisturizing while on the skin! I like using it as an overnight mask to deeply hydrate my skin! My skin feels so soft and smooth when I rinse it off the next morning! Complimentary from Summer Fridays.,1.0
"They made the jar so big, that when I opened, looks like 1/4 of the product was used, but it’s a great cream for oily or combination skin, especially when it’s hot.",1.0
"Yes this is indeed a very thick sleeping mask/ moisturizer but it smoothly absorbs into your skin. This can be applied all season. My skin over the years has changed, when you probably are in late 30s your skin pretty much drinks anything you apply. I wake up to a soft and supple skin also healthy glow. For me I do use more than a pea size. I think this will be a great addition for winter months as well. I got a small size, now planning to buy a bigger size.",1.0
"After using the sample from Voxbox my skin feels so refreshed and this cream goes on like literal silk!! I will definitely be buying soon, my teenage son even loves it!",1.0
"I received this product from Influenster. And I have to say, I am so impressed. I’ve been using it every night for 7 days now and it has already made my skin much softer, hydrated and plump. I feel like my skin isn’t nearly as oily now, and my face is seriously just a joy to touch because it’s incredibly soft. Just a couple drops a night after cleaning my face really does the trick.",1.0
ShiseidoUltimate Sun Protector Lotion is really easy to apply. The sunscreen did not get cakey or heavy feeling which was nice and was not oily or sticky. Felt very much like a lotion.  What I really liked was the fact that the lotion being ocean-friendly and Hawaii compliant.,1.0
"I like the packaging more than the product. The glass bottle is cute, but this serum didn’t do much for me, even with the smallest amount it made my face feel super oily.",0.0
"There is a trick to using this moisturiser. Follow the directions: rub between fingers until ’damp’ then PAT GENTLY onto skin. Do not start rubbing it onto your face right out of the container. RTFM needs to come back in vogue because we’re not  good at reading anything anymore--instructions, articles, labels--but that’s a review for another day! Another thing to remember is this is for really dry skin. If you’ve relatively ’normal’ skin in relatively moderate weather (ie, not tropical, not desert) you are not going to see miraculous results. If you have relatively young skin as well as the above? You are not going to see miraculous results. It’s not as thick as it seems when used properly, though it is intensely moisturising. It’s wonderful in winter. I also use it during The Allergy Months as it helps when my skin gets red, scratchy, and irritated. It’s nice on cuticles, dry knuckles and elbows. I use it only when I need it, but it can be used as a routine moisturiser as well. Essentially, the right moisturiser for the job! ^_~",1.0
"I really love this product. It does not feel oily on the skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated. I absolutely love the packaging.This product looks and feels very luxurious. I really like the scent, but it is very strong. I would warn those that are sensitive to fragrances to be careful with this one.",1.0
"Love the way this feels on my skin, it’s an odd texture for sunscreen but doesn’t leave a white-cast and seems to work well with my skin.",1.0
"I used this product for a full week after a trip when my lips got super dry. It did work and I saw the results of my lips coming back to life and being hydrated, but it took a few days to get the expected result. It’s not as creamy as other lip masks I’ve tried. The good thing is that it doesn’t have any smell, which is great since I know a few people who can’t use any products with strong smell.",1.0
I have been using this product for almost two months and although it does leave my under eye and eyelids feeling much softer it does nothing for the fine lines under my eyes... if anything they’ve gotten worse throughout my use of the product. I had high hopes due to the reviews and I love the actual application of the product but it didn’t do anything for me.,0.0
"Takes care of my dry skin, and is gentle with my sensitive skin! I only use once a day and it’s perfect!",1.0
I love this cream. I wear it morning and night and no longer have dry skin. It’s not oily or greasy after it sets in. Worth the money. I will buy again.,1.0
I wasn’t sure about this thin watery serum. Even after three days I didn’t feel any change in my skin. But after the first weeks I really saw an improvement in my overall glow of my skin! And everyday I use it I feel like it super charges my skin.  You do need to stay with it everyday. I took a few days off to give my fave a break and keep it clean and I saw I lost a tiny bit of natural glow. Overall I love this. Doesn’t break me out and my skin drinks it up!!,1.0
It’s a moisturizer And it an exfoliator! One of my faves from a Sephora sampler!,1.0
"I got it as a sample a while back and never used because I saw the word “coconut“ in the name, and coconut oil breaks me out like crazy. Well, it’s coconut fruit juice that is used here, not oil, and so far so great! No breakouts, no clogged pores, just moisturized skin and nice delicate glow all over my face. I’m very pleased with this product, and will  purchase full size once my sample runs out.",1.0
Really love this cleansing balm!! I love the scent as well. I like that this one doesn’t have the irritating ingredients of the original but still removes makeup perfectly. Only complaint is that I wish it wasn’t limited edition!!,1.0
So hydrating! Moisturizing and over all the best face cream I’ve ever used. Will purchase. I received this free through influenster. #HealthySkin #KiehlsGiftedMe #contest #complimentary @kiehls @Influenster,1.0
"While this took off majority of my full face of makeup, it broke out my face so badly! After using it for a week, I was getting breakouts here and there around my chin area/jawline. Figured out it was this after elimination. What a shame since I wanted to love it",0.0
"I received this product as part of Influenster’s vox box campaign and was really excited to try it out! I think it’s a nice product, but honestly I don’t think it really does much. My skin has been feeling more hydrated, but I’m not sure if it’s this product or the humidity. I don’t think I would go out of my own pocket to buy this, but I’m really glad I got it for free! I think perhaps this product would work better on someone who uses more intense serums, but my skincare is really simple - cleanse, tone, moisturize.",0.0
"I have acne-prone, oily skin, so it is really difficult to find a moisturizer that won’t break me out or make my skin even oilier. I’ve been using this cream primarily at night, but it is light enough to use during both day and night! The moisturizer absorbs really quickly and makes my skin feel super soft. This moisturizer has become a staple part of my skincare routine!",1.0
amazing! the product really helped my skin glow and left my skin also feeling soft. the stinging only happened a little at first but after was perfectly fine!,1.0
I’ve never used a sulfur-based acne treatment but it is a game changer. It helps dry out my stubborn acne and speeds up the whole process. The only con is that it does dry out the skin around it and can cause it to peel so I have to make sure to use stronger moisturizers.,1.0
"absolutely love this product, with other makeup removers it takes multiple times to get all the makeup off, However with this remover it only takes one go and its all gone. have bought it twice already!!",1.0
"I have bought this several times already. It never fails me. I have very, very sensitive, red skin with big pores and bad scars. After an endless hunt for products to mitigate my redness I found this little gem. It works soooo well to neutralize redness and I’ve seen improvements in my skin since using it. I feel like it actually helps heal my skin- not just cover up problem areas. It is a bit heavy- I will say that. I usually try to “dilute“ it by adding in a small drop of a more dewy primer like hourglass no. 28 or YSL Touche Eclat. That’s really not necessary if you don’t mind the heaviness though. It almost has a cooling element and actually adds a really healthy glowing effect too- not just redness reduction. I feel like it’s a one-stop-shop for multiple skincare concerns. Plus the spf in there is so great!I’ve recommended this to family and friends and I have yet to meet someone who doesn’t adore it. In all of my skincare exploring- this has remained a staple and will continue to. Love it!!If you’re on the fence seriously you should get it. It’s a game changer.",1.0
I received the Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream as a #freeproduct from TOPBOX #trywithtopbox. I only received the sample size but it lasted me a few days. I applied it twice a day (morning and night). It’s a really nice fast-absorbing cream. It feels moisturizing but doesn’t leave any sticky residue behind which I appreciate! I would definitely consider buying the full-size product to give a try for a longer period of time.,1.0
My skin feels softer I love the product I have been using it for a week or two I haven’t seen crazy results but it did blend nicely with my skin routines it’s gentle on sensitive skin and I didn’t find the scent over powering I generally liked this product,1.0
"When used correctly for my skin, this is a wonderful product. However, I can only use 2-3 times a week maximum or my skin begins to ’purge’ and I develop deep, cystic pimples that take a very long time to clear up. I do see the benefits as listed for this product, but I encourage you to read up and make sure you’re using this in the proper application!",1.0
"I got this as a sample. On first use, it felt oily (although I normally love thick creams). I had high hopes for the product because it is on the clean list and I used it for about 1 week before my face completely broke out - chin, cheeks, and temple. Oily finish, clogged pores, extreme breakout - everyone’s skin need are different but I personally wouldn’t recommend this product.",0.0
"I LOVE THIS. So gentle, very hydrating without making your skin oily. Skin texture and improved significantly and I’ve only had it for 4 days.",1.0
"For the price I expected better. The exfoliating beads are few and far between; it doesn’t feel like it’s exfoliating at all. The smell is subpar. My face feels clean-ish after washing, but requires a makeup wipe to get every last bit of makeup to achieve this.",0.0
Love the way this makes my skin look and feel.  Even after just 3 uses you could see a slight difference.,1.0
"I have been trying this moisturizer for the past 2 and a half weeks and I like it. It doesn’t leave my skin looking greasy or anything similar. Also I have some red acne scars and they are going away, so that’s a plus!",1.0
Gentle but strong it’s Amazing it removed all dead skin without being harsh I never used a exfioliant like this so I was  surprised but I liked it left my skin so soft and amazing ! Deff reccomend! It’s soft enough to use everyday,1.0
This is one of the only moisturizers I’ve found to heal my dry skin without breaking me out. I have sensitive skin and this has caused me no issues. There is no added fragrance either which is a huge bonus for me.,1.0
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product claims to make skin appear more lifted, firmer, reduce lines/wrinkles, and make skin feel hydrated.  I did find that my skin felt former and definitely more hydrated when using this crème.  I may need to use it longer to see other effects.  I was a little worried it would break me out because Estée Lauder products tend to do that, but I have not noticed any issues with that and skin sensitivity.  It does have a perfume scent which I minded a little bit, so I’m not sure if I would spend the money it costs to continue using it because it does carry a hefty price tag! I would need to use it longer to really know how great it is, but as far as hydrating and making skin more radiant, it did do that!",1.0
This product is absolutely fabulous!!! The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have almost vanished!! I will definitely be buying more of this!!,1.0
"The scent of this is so interesting...almost a watermelon jalapeño scent, but it’s nice. Smells fresh. I have noticed a decrease in size of my pores. I read you can use finger tips to apply or cotton swab but after reading another review I’m going to try my hands. It has a thick consistency which seems different for a toner. I’m definitely going to keep using. Also love the bottle!!",1.0
I first got this product as a free sample and I was hesitating to try it because usually my skin doesn’t like new skin care products! But after awhile my skin; with the weather changing decided to dry up and become sensitive so I decided to try it out and it worked great! It’s smooth and feels like velvet. The smell is wonderful and it’s not strong! Long lasting moisture and great skin food! Love it!,1.0
So I was a little worried about trying this at first because the reviews were mixed but this is the reformulated version. And I have to say I really love this stick formula. I don’t usually like facial stick sunscreens. They don’t glide great and leave streaks. This isn’t anything like that. It’s great. Has a nice light scent. It glides nicely on the skin and absorbs in to the skin. Leaves kind of a dewy finish. This one is clear and leaves no white cast. Hasn’t caused any breakouts of reactions and doesn’t turn my face in to a grease pit. I would definitely recommend this product. And will be buying again.,1.0
I LOVE this cleansing balm. This just melts off my eye makeup and feels so nice. I won’t ever be without this now.,1.0
This is how I start my morning off now!  Thanks to influenster I got this as a free sample for testing. The scent is great and my skin feels great already!,1.0
"I love this product, I have received this product complementary for review purpose, this face toner is amazing for dry skin, not like other toneres this hidratas your skin like a moisturizer but does not leave you a greasy felling, it is not harsh on your skin, my skin fells really hydrated since I’ve  tried it, i do recommend it you will love it",1.0
"I give it a star for the price firstly the price is very high and the formula is not that good, I did not see changes in my skin, I used it for a full month before writing this review and I already stopped using it or even finished the  bottle.  it has a loot of perfume which bothers me, i like my skin care without perfume or at list I don’t like to feel I’m applying a bottle of old perfume in my face instead of skin care.  I really did not like it, I would not buy it and I do not recommend it.",0.0
"Great face wash for the price. Foams really well and you don’t need much of it, so a Ruben lasts a long time. It also recently got changed to a 3 on the Think Dirty app (app tells you how toxic products are) which is even better as this means it’s toxin free which I love! Would definitely recommend.",1.0
I’ve never tried a micro exfoliant before--this product is interesting because it turns into a paste but I feel like it tends to get messy. Would rather the product come pre-mixed for easy use and application. Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.,0.0
I absolutely love this product. i have dry sensitive skin so ots hard to actually find things that match with me. the only down fall is how thin it is.,1.0
"i wanted to love this. it smells awesome. it works well. but if you get it in your eyes you better be prepared to be blind for at least a half hour. Also, after using it daily to remove my makeup, my eyelids got dry and scaly. stopped using it and my eyes slowly got better. such a shame.",0.0
"i hated these! they left my face super sticky feeling, and they made my skin break out (which it rarely ever does). i love other FAB products, like their facewash and ultra repair cream, but i will never buy these again!",0.0
"Makes your skin sticky, even made mine itch a little. doesn’t smell great either.",0.0
"DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.. I wanted to like this product because it’s “clean” and has really good reviews, but it made my sensitive skin really angry. I should have known when it had a scent to it that it wouldn’t work. I used it at night before bed and woke up with red bumps all over my skin and as the day went on my skin felt extremely itchy and got more bumpy. Unfortunately, I couldn’t recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.",0.0
"Literally amazing, last for a good 3 hours, for me that’s really good cause my lips get so dry, smells amazing ❤️",1.0
I love this exfoliating cleanser. Most exfoliating products you can’t use too much because it will dry or break out your face. This cleanser you can use everyday. Not one time has it irritated my skin. The beads in this cleanser aren’t rough and big. They are finely milled so it goes over your skin smooth. I really like this cleanser and the price isn’t too expensive. I recommend if you are a skincare junkies like myself!,1.0
I used this after microneedling to help make my skin glow more but in my opinion it didn’t do anything at all. In fact it left my skin greasy and sort of tacky feeling. I thought maybe I put too much on the first time so when I tried again a few days later I only used a pea sized amount. Still greasy and tacky. It never really absorbed into my skin leaving it soft like a lot of other products do. It also made me break out a bit. I like the brand but this just doesn’t work for my skin.,0.0
This product has a lovely smell of watermelon that I personally love! When applying this toner on your face it may feel a bit sticky/tacky but I don’t mind it at all. This toner has helped with small bumps I have on my forehead!,1.0
"Wow! The Dr. Gross’ Skincare - Alpha Beta Pore Perfecting and Refining serum is legitimately a miracle in a bottle! I have tried for years to find something to even out my skin and minimize my pores, to no avail. As I have REALLY dry skin, nothing has ever worked. But Dr. Gross’ Skincare - Alpha Beta Pore Perfecting and Refining serum is perfection. It’s really been the answer to my years long prayers. It makes my skin super HYDRATED, (which is so beyond important.) So incredibly smooth, and really gives a great “blurred” look (Definitely helping to diminish lines and imperfections!) without overdrying or being too thick. It feels incredible as it totally feels weightless. I’m definitely sticking with my miricle in a bottle FOREVER! A",1.0

My favorite eye cream hands down. In the winter my eyes tend to get dry and when I apply eyeshadow it looks terrible and ages me. This eye cream remedied my issues and makes my eyes appear smoother and more youthful. I won’t go without my C-Tango ever again!,1.0
"I have acne prone skin and have struggled with finding a moisturizer that isn’t oil free, but not too heavy. The answer is this wonderful product. It’s creamy, cool and has no added chemicals. My face doesn’t feel oily and I can even wear it under my makeup.",1.0
I was really excited to try this out based on the good reviews but it literally did nothing for me. I was hoping it would make my face look pore-less as it claims but it didn’t make any difference. The smell is good but I didn’t like anything else about it.,0.0
"Simplemente elMejor! Super ligero, sin sensación grasosa.",1.0
It is a great moisturizer for summer. Personally think the fragrance is light and calming.,1.0
Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed. Giving 4 stars - the smell is odd and my skin tingled a little.,1.0
I really enjoyed this exfoliant! The texture is so much different than most of them. It really got in and got all the dead skin and helped with my pores. However I do not think it’s worth the price that it is. I have other high end exfoliants that do just as good for cheaper. I received this product complimentary to test out for a review from influenster.,1.0
"Was a normal cream. Not amazing, not horrible. It made my skin a bit too oily. For the price it’s sold at. I was expecting alot more impact then so/so. There are better creams out there that are not so overpriced. Don’t believe the hype. Save your money for things like...food.",0.0
I love this product! I received this complimentary from Sunday Riley. I instantly saw results within the first few days.  You will not be disappointed by purchasing this product.  It absorbs quickly into your skin without you feeling oily and shiny.,1.0
Good as long as your skin is not sensitive. I had wind burn from skiing and the sting made me have to put a bag of ice on my face.,1.0

My absolute favorite makeup remover! I love how it melts the makeup away and leaves the skin feeling smooth and nice! Second time buying it,1.0
Let me say first - I got this free from Influenster. I personally would not spend this price point BUT I freaking LOVE this stuff. I work in a super dry environment so at night my skin needs TLC and this is exactly it.,1.0
"This is an amazing lip balm, it smells delicious and makes your lips soft and moisturized. It would be a perfect 5 stars if not for the frankly insultingly misleading packaging. I rolled the lip balm all the way up before the first use to see how much the tube came with, and it’s not even a third of the size that the packaging would lead you to believe. For the $18 price tag, SDJ can afford to at least fill the tube. I would have given it 2 stars for the deception alone, but the balm itself is really nice and if you’re willing to spend $18 on a couple months’ worth of lip balm then you can’t do any better than this",0.0

I’m not wearing foundation in this picture you guys!!! This product left my skin so soft and glowy. It feels gentle but I saw real results. I love that a little goes a long way and I love that it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It’s affordable and truly works! I also appreciate that it isn’t drying and left me very plump and glowy.,1.0
"I got my lip balm as a complimentary sample to try from influenster and I love the packaging, it is soooo cute ! It taste and smells so good. After 2 uses through out the the it made my lips super soft and kissable! I will definitely buy more flavors to try !",1.0
thanks I received this product for free!! after using it.  leaves your skin clean and smooth.  you will fall in love when using it.  does not damage and does not dry out your skin,1.0
So nourishing and plumps my lips slightly for sure. Jar lasts forever.,1.0
"Clinique products work good for my skin and this is no exception. I have dry skin and I love using this as my day time moisturizer. I prefer using gel like moisturizers during the day. This product just soaks into my skin, so it doesn’t effect my make up I apply afterwards. It has a pleasant light scent. I would recommend this product to others.",1.0
"My lips haven’t been terribly dry this winter, so I can’t say it’s gotten a thorough testing, but it’s definitely helped the moderate dryness I have had. It’s a decent sized jar for a lip product; large enough to last a long time and make it well worth the price. It also comes with the cutest tiny spatula to apply with! I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out!",1.0
"I received this product for free in return of my honest opinion.Though I don’t think I used it long enough for it to make a huge change to my skin, I liked that my skin felt more hydrated. I also like that the scent was subtle.",1.0
"I LOVE this moisturizer. A tiny bit goes a long way. It smells amazing, doesn’t leave my skin greasy and keeps it hydrated all day.",1.0
"I do like this stuff. I have really oily sensitive skin and I couldn’t say it helped with the oily but it didn’t cause any new breakouts. I honestly would probably keep buying it if it wasn’t for the price. I used this for about 8 months, but went back to purpose face wash because I feel like it works just the same and drastically cheaper. I have it a 3 because of the cost. Doesn’t last long either.",0.0
This is basically a fancy moisturizer. It doesn’t do anything special that would make me repurchase. A good product just not amazing. I could get the same results from slathering vanicream on my face which is far more affordable.,0.0
"Received this product for my honest review.  I applied this cream under eyes, making them feel soft and nourishing, making my fine lines less visible. Great product and I highly recommend",1.0
"This product was received as part of a promotion from Influenster and Korres— While my review is genuine, I did not purchase or pay for this product.  This skin cream was such a surprise! It has a very gentle, clean scent, and absorbed well. I’ve only been testing it for a couple days now in place of my daily moisturizers, but I can already feel the texture of my skin evening out! I’m excited to continue using this product, and look forward to more positive results.",0.0
Unusual from other pore strips but in the best way. I’m not used to leaving on pore strips for more than 20 minutes let alone getting a full sleep with them! Some would say the suspense is the greatest part but then you take it off and WOW. It got EVERYTHING. My skin felt great after and my pores are visibly smaller. Definitely will buy again!,1.0
I love the way this smells and it feels like it really hydrates my skin. I have had to put more than just a couple sprays to feel a difference though so I’m not sure how long the bottle will last me for the price.,1.0
"I started using this moisturizer about a week and a half ago and I am really happy with it. I use it as my nighttime moisturizer since I use a different one with SPF in the morning. I like how this one feels and it gets the job done! Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a small, affordable, nighttime moisturizer (good travel size).",1.0
"I tried this for a little more than a week, and I didn’t like what it did to my skin. The smell was nice and it felt good going on, but in the morning my pores looked larger and my skin felt congested. I guess it just isn’t right for my skin (oily/combination that gets dry patches in the winter).",0.0
I received a sample the other day and was excited to try it....I didnt notice burning or heat so I thought everything was fine. next morning...I had red bumps all over my face! I was so mad. and now my face is very dry as well. and before using this my skin was doing the best it’s ever been...so needless to say I wont be using this ever again. I just read the comments and realized I wasnt alone. I definitely would not recommend this product.,0.0
This is the first eye product that I’ve used and I’m in love! I have puffy/dry skin around my eyes but after using this product it seems to have gotten better :) Putting this product in the fridge also intensifies the cooling effect that this product has!,1.0
The best remedy for my extremely dry skin! It’s light and really hydrating at the same time,1.0
I love how lightweight and moisturizing this face cream is! It has a lovely scent too! I apply a little bit every morning and night after washing my face a d it makes my skin feel hydrated and happy! The size is great for travel and keeping in my bag which is nice because I never want to go without this stuff! “Gifted by La Mer”,1.0
"This cleanser is a MUST HAVE. I’ve never used a cleanser that didn’t leave my skin feeling dry, tight, and immediately had me seeking my moisturizer until I tried this Superfood Cleanser. My skins feels soft and supple but completely clean of all dirt and oils. The bottle also lasts me forever, love that it’s a great bang for your buck! Seriously, give this a try and thank me later.",1.0
"So glad I got to try this lip mask! It smells great, feels amazing, and hydrated like no other. I’ve used lip masked before and I have to say this is my favorite so far. It feels amazing on and it lasts almost all night! I highly recommend",1.0
I was so happy when I saw that I was getting this in my voxbox! The application is so simple and it goes on very smoothly. It has SPF 50 and it is not sticky at all. It is also water resistant and can go over makeup(but I have not tried that yet) I can’t wait to see how it works in the summertime as well,1.0
"I had the opportunity to try this product and used all of it.  It was refreshing, hydrating and absorbent.  It felt great on my skin.  It was easy to incorporate into my existing skincare regimen.  I also enjoyed the purple packaging.",1.0
"This is the first product I’ve tried from this brand and I will definitely be buying again! I’ve used it for a few weeks now and I find the cream very hydrating (a must in Canadian Winter!) but not heavy or oily at all. It absorbs quite nicely, has good texture and a lovely light scent! I use this as a day cream now, it will probably be my night cream in the summer months.",1.0
My new favorite makeup remover! I used to use the Boscia cool cleansing oil and since Sephora doesn’t carry it anymore I decided to give this a go. I love oil based makeup removers for removing mascara and brows and this one is amazing. The scent is subtle and amazing and the texture is silky and smooth. You need just a little dot to remove a full face of makeup so this tub will last a long time. Definitely recommend it!,1.0
"I am new to Dr Dennis Gross Skincare but I must say I’m impressed. First I used the Alpha Beta Peel, then waited 30 minutes",1.0
Great product ... have a wonderful smell and my skin feels really good after application.,1.0
"This is a fantastic moisturizer. Feels and smells wonderful. It’s pretty lightweight though, making it really good for spring and summer. I definitely need something more hydrating for the winter months.",1.0
"The moisturizer I’d nice and creamy and spreads very easily. I just don’t think it is anything special. It feels hydrating at first, but after a couple hours it made my skin feel very dry.",0.0
This product is absolutely amazing. feel like everything makes me break out and this does not. switched from origins and love it.,1.0
"A beautiful gel cream texture that sinks into the skin quickly and hydrates without leaving any residue. I found this wears beautifully under makeup and SPF in the AM and also over serums in the PM. Great for my combo/oily skin, especially going into warmer months. Has the lovely signature Fresh rose scent.",1.0
"Es un buen producto , lo use por poco tiempo, pero mi piel se sintio fresca y limpia .. creo que voy a cómpralo para ver mejor sus resultados a largo plazo , creo que estaría bien darle una oportunidad al producto gifted by dermatologica sampling",1.0
"I wanted to try this cleanser out for the longest time last year, but due to its popularity (by being out of stock constantly), I moved on. However, in a recent Sephora order, I got a sample size (15mL) in a deluxe sample bag. I have been trying it out for about a week, both in the AM and PM. I don’t notice a difference at all. It does what it’s supposed to do but nothing exceptionally well. I would never drop $30+ to $80 on a simple facial cleanser like this one. I am happy to have received a sample, so I didn’t have to waste my money to find out I wouldn’t have liked it.",0.0
Smells great but really has no effect on my skin and it’s overpriced. Stick to the cleanser.,1.0
I got the mini sized sample using my insider points. After using the product for about two weeks my skin has flared up with acne. Did not suit my sensitive skin.,0.0
My absolute must-have product. Doesn’t irritate my skin or clog my pores. The skin feels so subtle and hydrated.,1.0
"I picked up a bottle of this to start using on my scalp to help combat dandruff. I would apply it about 15 minutes before a shower and let it sit. I noticed that my hair would stay cleaner much longer when using this, and it did seem to help keep my scalp healthy. I’ve only recently started using it on my face at night (before moisturizing) and I’ve noticed a huge amount of brightening and evening out my skin tone. I have mild rosacea on my cheeks and this hasn’t aggravated it at all. Nor does it dry or irritate my skin. Lasts a long time and the price is great for the amount you get!",1.0
"Absolutely loving this! I received this in a recent voxbox and have been so happy. It’s a high quality sunscreen that you’ll want to use all summer. It’s definitely on the pricey side, but in my opinion totally worth it. It doesn’t have a strong chemical scent and lasts all day. I did receive this product in exchange for my honest opinion.",1.0
"Okay I literally never write reviews for products, but I had to for this one! After months of dealing with severe hormonal acne I’m finally rounding the corner and now have a ton of scarring and redness. I apply this product after sunscreen/moisturizer in my morning routine and it immediately cancels out the redness and scarring on my face like magic! After applying this I feel confident going out without makeup on, almost like a tinted moisturizer. The best part of this product is that it doesn’t break out my acne prone skin! It’s amazing!",1.0
"I received this product to try and I love it the smell is really good, this cream makes my skin so soft and bright, I love when I use a cream and after dry my skin don’t feel sticky or oily, I will for sure buy more for me.",1.0
"I’ve bought this 5x at least. It’s light, absorbs easily and the scent is pleasant and unobtrusive. I use it summer and winter, maybe in winter pair it with a face oil but I think it’s the platonic ideal of a moisturizer.",1.0
This product is wonderful.  It left my oele super hydrated and soft.  very fragrant with wonderful texture.,1.0
"Hydrating, but that’s about it. I had high hopes for this. I have really dry skin but my under eye area needs a serum as well, I think. Love Tatcha products but this one unfortunately just feels like a moisturizer, nothing too significant to notice.",0.0
Not for me. Made me break out.,0.0
This is a great clarifying mask. The smell is absolutely amazing. Love love love.,1.0
"If you’re like me entering your mid twenties you’ve still got that problematic acne with some hyper pigmentation from past bad decisions you made messing with said acne, AND you’re starting to notice the beginning of fine lines and wrinkles. Well, WORRY NO MORE! I use this every other night and within two weeks it’s like I have the skin I’ve always dreamed of! My skin has cleared up and my fine lines have gone away! (The sooner your start anti-aging the less you’ll have to do when you’re older) Just be sure to use a light-heavy moisturizer depending on your existing skin type as the serum can dry you out a bit!",1.0
"This stuff is like gold!! Not only does it make your lips feel so hydrated, it also gives your lips an amazing shine that actually lasts unlike other balms or even glosses!",1.0
Could not live without it! My lips used to be so dry especially during winter months that it would split and bleed often. After using this my lips never bled anymore and are always so moisturized! Worth the price also as you do get quite a lot and will probably last you the whole year,1.0
"This cream is super hydrating, I put it on at night and in the morning it has absorbed and is ready for makeup. I haven’t noticed a difference yet, but I am only 33, and not a smoker so my skin still looks great (not many wrinkles). I received this complimentary in my Influenster voxbox but all the opinions are my own.",1.0
I love this serum. I have been using it with the guava vitamin c serum and I definitely noticed my skin has been smoother and brighter. The smell of this product is very pleasant and not strong. The texture is a little tacky when first applied but goes away. Highly recommend this serum for dry sensitive skin like mine.,1.0
I loved this serum!  It felt nice going on and made my skin feel great.  I highly recommend it.,1.0
"I used this all over and my face drank it up. It’s lightweight and feels so good, it works as a good base before priming your face too! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.*",1.0
Surprisingly easy to use for someone that has never used self tanner. I have the light colour and it is the subtle sunkissed look I was hoping for.,1.0
Big fan of this brand and have been using this particular product for a week with pleasant results. My skin has felt more hydrated yet in the T-zone seems more balanced. I have very sensitive skin and usually a product w certain ingredients will break my 50  yo skin out within 48 hours- but so far so good! Not much of a fragrance but that can be a good thing.,1.0
